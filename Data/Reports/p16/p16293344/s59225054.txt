                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness and ECG changes  // Pneumonia?
 Mediastinal widening?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CT torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and type A aortic dissection repair
 with unchanged tortuous appearance of the mediastinal contour which is widened
 superiorly.  Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged with a
 coronary artery stent again noted.  Hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lung volumes are lower compared to
 the previous radiograph.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 areas of atelectasis and scarring, not substantially changed in the interval. 
 No pneumothorax is present however the medial aspect of both lung apices is
 obscured by the patient's neck and chin projecting over this area.  No large
 pleural effusion is seen.  Moderate degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine with slight loss of height of several lower thoracic vertebral
 bodies, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post type A aortic dissection repair with unchanged widened and
 tortuous mediastinal contour.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis and scarring.
