                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation, assess tube position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from two hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position terminating 4.8 cm
 above the carina.  Orogastric tube courses in the stomach and out of view. 
 Enlarged aortic knob is again noted as on a prior radiograph correlating with
 ruptured aortic dissection seen on the recent CT. Bibasilar atelectasis or
 partial lobar collapse is worsened from the prior study. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Satisfactory position of monitoring and support devices.
 2. Findings compatible with known aortic dissection.
 3. Worsened bibasilar atelectasis
