                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with a prior study from ___ as well as a CT abdomen and pelvis
 from today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is
 midline sternotomy wires again noted.  The lung volumes are quite low, likely
 related to marked gaseous distention/dilatation of the bowel in the upper
 abdomen.  Please refer to same-day abdominopelvic CT for further details. 
 Basilar atelectasis is noted.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal
 contour is stable.  Dextroscoliosis of the T-spine noted.  There are old right
 rib cage deformities with clips in the right axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with basilar atelectasis likely related to bowel
 pathology in the upper abdomen, better assessed on same-day CT of the abdomen
 and pelvis.
