                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ at 19:53.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with ascending aortic replacement, assess
 for interval change and effusions.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 11:16.
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest dated ___ at 19:53 are
 submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The patient is rotated to her left, limiting evaluation of the overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours, but these are likely stable.  Status post median
 sternotomy for an ascending aortic replacement.  Right internal jugular
 central line has its tip in the distal SVC, unchanged in position.  Persistent
 layering bilateral effusions with more focal airspace consolidation at the
 left base which may represent compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia
 cannot be entirely excluded.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Clips overlying the right axilla suggest
 prior axillary surgery.  Evidence of remote right-sided rib fractures with no
 acute bony abnormality appreciated.
