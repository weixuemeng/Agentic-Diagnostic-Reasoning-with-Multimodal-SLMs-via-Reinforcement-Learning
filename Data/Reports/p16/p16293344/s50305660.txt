                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Extensive past medical history including prior aortic dissection
 repair and atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  The aortic contours appear
 unchanged on radiography.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 stable.  Streaky basilar opacities have improved and residual remaining
 opacities are more suggestive of atelectasis than pneumonia.  Surgical clips
 project over the right axillary region.  Right-sided rib deformities appear
 unchanged with associated slight pleural thickening.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones are probably demineralized.  Loss
 in height among several mid through lower thoracic vertebral bodies appears
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent streaky basilar opacities, considerably decreased and
 most suggestive of atelectasis or scarring.  No definite acute disease.
