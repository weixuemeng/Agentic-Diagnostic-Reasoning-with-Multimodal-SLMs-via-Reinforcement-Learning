                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after ascending aortic
 replacement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is stable appearance of the mediastinal contour.  New opacity projecting
 over the right heart might reflect shifting of the fluid but interval increase
 in pleural effusion is highly suspected on the right.  Left retrocardiac
 consolidation is unchanged.  There is no appreciable pneumothorax seen.
