 The patient is status post median sternotomy.  The patient is rotated somewhat

 aspiration or pneumonia is not excluded.  Multiple old right-sided rib
 deformities are again seen.  The aorta is tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There may be
 a hiatal hernia.  Surgical clips are seen projecting over the right axilla.

 although underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration not excluded.
