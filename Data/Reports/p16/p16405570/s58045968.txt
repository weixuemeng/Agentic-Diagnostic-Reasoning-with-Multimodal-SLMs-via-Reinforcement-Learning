 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough x1 week.  Assess for pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs appear
 clear, though low lung volumes somewhat limits evaluation.  No definite signs
 of pneumonia or CHF.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is
 mildly enlarged, though this is unchanged from the prior exam.  The
 mediastinal contour appears normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable mild cardiomegaly.  Otherwise, unremarkable.
