 As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing left-sided pneumonia
 has almost but not completely resolved.  There is no substantial evidence of
 scarring at the location of the previous pneumonia.  Elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm persists. Moderate cardiomegaly and elongation of the descending
 aorta.  No evidence of new pulmonary opacities suggesting a recurrent
 infectious disease.  No pleural effusions.
