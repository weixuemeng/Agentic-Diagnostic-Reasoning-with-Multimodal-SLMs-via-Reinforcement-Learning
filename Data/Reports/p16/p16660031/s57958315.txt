                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are decreased compared to the prior study.  This accentuates the
 size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely within normal limits. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is noted, but no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes without focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No
 displaced fractures are seen, though if there is continued concern for rib
 fracture, then a dedicated rib series is recommended.
