                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion and vertigo.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively
 unchanged with mild unfolding of thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 not engorged.  Bibasilar airspace opacities have a somewhat linear
 configuration are likely related to atelectasis.  Infection, however, cannot
 be excluded particularly at the right lung base.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities, likely reflective of atelectasis though
 infection particularly at the right lung base is not completely excluded.
