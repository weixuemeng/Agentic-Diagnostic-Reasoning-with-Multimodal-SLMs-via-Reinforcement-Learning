 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypotension, wheezing.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Examination is

 of atelectasis, especially in the setting of relatively low lung volumes. 
 There is no definite pulmonary vascular congestion, consolidation, or
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
