 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Left-sided chest wall tenderness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Relative
 linear right mid-to-lower lung opacity seen on the frontal view is grossly
 stable as compared to the prior and may represent overlapping vascular
 structures.  No new focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
