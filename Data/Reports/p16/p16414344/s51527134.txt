                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Runny nose and cough for two days.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Hilar contours are
 stable.  Lung volumes are low.  Bibasilar opacities given the low lung volumes
 are likely atelectatic; however, infection cannot be excluded by this
 appearance.  No evidence of effusion or pneumothorax.  Sternotomy wires are in
 place, and surgical clips project over the mediastinum.  No acute bony
 abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities in the context of low lung volumes likely
 represent atelectatic change; however, infection cannot be excluded.
