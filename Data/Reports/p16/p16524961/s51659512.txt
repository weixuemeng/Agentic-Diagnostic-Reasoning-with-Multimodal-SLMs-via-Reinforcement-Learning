                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Generalized weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size remains mildly enlarged. 
 The aorta demonstrates diffuse mural calcifications.  Moderate to large hiatal
 hernia is redemonstrated.  There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema, which
 appears similar when compared to the prior study.  Left basilar opacification
 appears slightly improved compared to the prior study, reflecting residual
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Compression
 deformities within the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine appear unchanged
 when compared to the prior radiograph from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Moderate-to-large hiatal
 hernia with improved aeration of the left lung base, likely representing
 residual atelectasis.
