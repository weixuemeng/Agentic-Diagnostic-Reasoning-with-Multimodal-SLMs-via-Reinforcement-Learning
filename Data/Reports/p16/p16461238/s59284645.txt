                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Thoracic aortic arch is tortuous with mild
 atherosclerotic calcifications.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Mildly
 increased interstitial markings are chronic.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  The
 pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.  No overt
 traumatic findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Mildly increased
 interstitial markings are unchanged and probably related to emphysema.  No
 overt traumatic findings; if there is focality on exam, rib series may be
 helpful.
