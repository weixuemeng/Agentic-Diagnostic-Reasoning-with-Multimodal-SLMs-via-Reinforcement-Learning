                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been the development of
 bilateral opacifications, much worse on the right, consistent with asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions are again seen with atelectatic
 changes at the base, especially including substantial volume loss in the left
 lower lobe.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would
 be difficult to exclude.  
 
 Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
