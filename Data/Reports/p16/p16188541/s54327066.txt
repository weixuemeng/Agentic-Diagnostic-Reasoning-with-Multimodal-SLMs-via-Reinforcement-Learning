                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluation for pneumonia in a ___-year-old female with a productive
 cough and shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  AP and lateral chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a hazy opacity
 located to the left of the heart border that is not seen on the lateral view. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  There are no bony abnormalities.  There is no free air
 under the right hemidiaphragm.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Small hazy opacity located to the left of the heart border see
 only on the frontal radiograph, not substantiated on the lateral view,  most
 likely due to atelectasis vs pneumonia.
