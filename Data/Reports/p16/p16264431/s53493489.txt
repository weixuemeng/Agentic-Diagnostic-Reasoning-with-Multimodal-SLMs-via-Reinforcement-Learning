 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:03 PM
  There appear to be worsening of reticular opacities particularly on the right
  in both the upper and lower lungs.  In addition a 8 mm nodule projects over
  the ___ right rib, new since the ___ study.  These findings are suspicious
  for interstitial disease.  Obscuration of the right heart border, particularly
  at the lower aspect is most likely scarring / atelectasis rather than
  pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of HCV cirrhosis, admitted with spontaneous bacterial
 peritonitis and hepatic encephalopathy, here to evaluate for pneumonia or
 pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased.  There is increased
 opacification at the right lung apex laterally compared to the prior study of
 ___, which may be due to overlapping bony structures.  A small focal airspace
 opacity is also noted in the right lung base, which is at the level of the
 nipples but has no correlate in the left hemithorax.  There is streaky
 opacification of the left lung base, which projects over the lower lobe on the
 lateral view.  A small left pleural effusion is present.  Mild apical pleural
 thickening is noted bilaterally.  No pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, but stable.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits and unchanged.  The trachea is slightly
 deviated to the right by the aortic arch.  A lucency projecting to the right
 of the trachea in the cervical region likely represents air within the
 esophagus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left lower lobe pneumonia with small left parapneumonic effusion.
 2.  New focal airspace opacities in the right lung apex and right lung base
 may represent superimposition of normal structures.  Attention is recommended
 on followup.
 
 Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ medicine via telephone
 at 10:50am on ___.
