                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with known bilateral pleural effusion on empiric
 antibiotics for pneumonia at rehab
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears mildly enlarged but unchanged.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted at the knob.  There is mild pulmonary edema along
 with a layering moderate size right pleural effusion.  Small left pleural
 effusion is also noted.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect compressive
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, layering and at least moderate in size on the
 right, and small on the left, along with bibasilar opacities, likely
 compressive atelectasis.  Infection is not excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.  Mild pulmonary edema.
