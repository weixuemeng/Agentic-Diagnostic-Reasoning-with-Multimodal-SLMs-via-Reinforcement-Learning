                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with cholangiocarcinoma on
 chemotherapy, now with fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 Port-A-Cath catheter is in place with its tip terminating at the level of
 cavoatrial junction.  Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Bilateral
 calcified pleural plaques are re-demonstrated.  No new focal consolidations to
 suggest interval development of infectious process demonstrated.  Linear
 atelectasis is noted in the left lower lung.  The extent of atelectasis is
 slightly more pronounced than on the prior study but still would not fulfill
 the criteria for infectious process.  In the absence of other sources,
 attention to this area as a potential pneumonia should be paid.
