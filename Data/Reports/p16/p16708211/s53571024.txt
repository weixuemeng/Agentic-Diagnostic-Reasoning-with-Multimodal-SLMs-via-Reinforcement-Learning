                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever, immunosuppressed  // eval after central line
 placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single AP supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of a
 right internal jugular central line. No evidence of pneumothorax. The line
 appears to terminate within the mid SVC. There is re- demonstration of a
 right-sided Port-A-Cath which is in unchanged position. Patient is rotated.
 Allowing for this, overall appearance of bilateral lungs and mediastinal
 structures is unchanged when compared to chest radiograph obtained 5 hr
 previously. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted as is low lung volumes. Patchy
 right perihilar opacity again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of right internal jugular central line. No evidence of
 pneumothorax. Line appears to terminate within the mid SVC. When compared to
 most recent radiograph obtained 5 hours previously, no interval changes are
 otherwise identified.
