                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Fever in immunosuppressed patient, history of cholangiocarcinoma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the junction of the SVC and
 right atrium. Lung volumes are low. The heart size is accentuated as a result,
 but appears to be border line enlarged. The aorta is mildly tortuous. 
 Mediastinal contours are unchanged, and there is no evidence of pulmonary
 vascular congestion. Patchy opacities seen within the right perihilar region,
 which appear relatively unchanged compared to the previous exam. Known
 pulmonary nodules are better assessed on the preceding CT. Atelectatic changes
 within the lung bases are slightly more pronounced, likely due to low lung
 volumes. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are mild
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. Partially imaged is a percutaneous
 catheter within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Surgical anchors are
 redemonstrated within both shoulders.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with slightly worse bibasilar atelectasis.  Known pulmonary
 nodules are better assessed on the preceding CT. Similar appearance of patchy
 right perihilar opacity.
