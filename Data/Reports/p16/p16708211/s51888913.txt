 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Plain radiograph dated ___. Correlation made to chest CT
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the left IJ central venous catheter. The
 tip of an accessed right subclavian MediPort extends to the superior
 cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral predominantly
 airspace opacities have improved since ___. There is minimal right
 lung base subsegmental atelectasis. A small left pleural effusion is
 unchanged. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits despite the
 projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved airspace opacities, which are likely due to resolving edema.
 Minimal right lung base subsegmental atelectasis.
 Stable small left pleural effusion.
