                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Acute onset shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Single-lead left-sided pacemaker is seen with lead extending to the expected
 position of the right ventricle.  There is left base opacity and obscuration
 of the left hemidiaphragm which may be due to atelectasis and underlying
 consolidation, trace left pleural effusion may be present.  The right lung is
 clear and relatively hyperinflated.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The
 aortic knob is calcified.  Surgical clips are seen in the right upper
 quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left base opacity may be due to combination of atelectasis and
 trace pleural effusion versus consolidation due to infection.  Enlarged
 cardiac silhouette.
