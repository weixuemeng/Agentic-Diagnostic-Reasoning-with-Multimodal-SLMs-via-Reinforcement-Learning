                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a cough, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes and a suboptimal inspiratory effort.  Allowing for
 changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal
 limits.  Diffuse, centrally predominant interstitial opacities are consistent
 with pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no focal lung consolidation. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.
