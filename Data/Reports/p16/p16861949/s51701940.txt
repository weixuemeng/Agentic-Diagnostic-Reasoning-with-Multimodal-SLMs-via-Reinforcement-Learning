                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Sternal pain.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs are clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are
 in the thoracic spine.  
 
 There is a nodular dense opacity projecting medial to the right clavicle of
 unknown etiology, likely is from an osseous structure, but a lung nodule
 cannot be excluded.  Shallow obliques and apical lordotic views are
 recommended for further evaluation.
 
 Of note, this examination was not tailored to evaluate the sternum.
