 TECHNIQUE
 Frontal and lateral view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 MODERATE CARDIOMEGALY HAS INCREASED There is no PULMONARY EDEMA, BUT THE
 CHANGE IN CONFIGURATION OF THE RIGHT DIAPHRAGMATIC PLEURAL SURFACE SUGGESTS A
 NEW SMALL RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION. NEW CONSOLIDATION IN THE RIGHT LOWER LUNG
 DOES NOT OBSCURE THE HEART BORDER, AND IS PROBABLY PNEUMONIA IN THE LOWER
 LOBE.

 NEW RIGHT LOWER LOBE PNEUMONIA, MAY CONTRIBUTE TO EARLY CARDIAC DECOMPENSATION
 REFLECTED IN PROGRESSIVE MODERATE CARDIOMEGALY AND NEW SMALL RIGHT PLEURAL
 EFFUSION.
