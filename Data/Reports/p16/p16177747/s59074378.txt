 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sickle cell with cp/sob // eval pna, acute
 chest
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear given bibasal atelectasis to the low lung volumes. There
 is no focal consolidation identified. There is no evidence of pneumonia,
 pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette is likely exaggerated by
 the AP projection and low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Given low lung volumes, no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
