                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sickle cell disease with elevated white count.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is globular enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette without vascular congestion.  This raises the possibility of
 pericardial effusion or cardiomyopathy.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
