                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with s/p compresson w cp  // ptx?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to increased prominence of the bronchovascular
 structures. Mild central vascular congestion is noted.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle may represent a trace pleural effusion.  There is no lobar
 consolidation, pneumothorax, or overt pulmonary interstitial edema.  The heart
 appears mild-moderately enlarged but is suboptimally imaged.  No displaced rib
 fractures visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with cardiomegaly and mild central pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No pneumothorax.
