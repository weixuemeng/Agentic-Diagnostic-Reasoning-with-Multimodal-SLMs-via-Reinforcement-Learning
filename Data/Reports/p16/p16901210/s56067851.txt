                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough and weight loss.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate round and oval ring shadows
 in the right mid lung suggesting bronchiectasis.  The lungs are otherwise well
 expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pleural surfaces are
 unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings suggestive of bronchiectasis in the right mid lung, a chest CT can be
 obtained for confirmation. No evidence of pneumonia.
