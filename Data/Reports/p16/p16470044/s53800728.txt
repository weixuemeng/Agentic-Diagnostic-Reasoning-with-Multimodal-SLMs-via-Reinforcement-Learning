                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe sepsis and hypoxic respiratory
 failure intubated, suctioning tube feeds from ETT  // e/o aspiration, OGT
 position
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:42
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present.  The tip lies at the level of mid clavicular heads, 3.7
 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present, the tip overlies the upper
 stomach.  Right IJ central line tip overlies the right atrium.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged.  Diffuse patchy opacities
 in both lungs, most pronounced in the left mid and right lower zones, together
 with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, are grossly similar to the
 prior study.
 
 No new area of focal consolidation is identified.
 
 No gross effusion.  Small bilateral effusions would be difficult to exclude.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as described.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette stable.
 
 Diffuse patchy opacities in both lungs, left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation overall similar compared with 1 day earlier.
