 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new NG tube placement  // NG tube location  
 NG tube location
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 05:09.
 
 Previous transient radiographic improvement in the right lung has reversed ;
 this could been due to concurrent increase in positive pressure ventilator
 support rather than real clinical changed.  Appearance of the lungs, with
 widespread consolidation has not changed considerably over the course of this
 hospitalization.  Heart is mildly enlarged, but there has been no appreciable
 pleural effusion or mediastinal vascular widening.  Differential diagnosis
 therefore includes noncardiogenic edema, widespread viral or pneumocystis
 infection, pulmonary hemorrhage, reaction illicit medication, among others. 
 Pleural effusion is presumed, but not large.  No pneumothorax.
 
 ET tube, right subclavian catheter nasogastric drainage tube all in standard
 placements.
