                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y.o. homeless man with unclear past medical history brought in
 by EMS with fever and altered mental status. Per EMS report, the patient was
 found face down in the street vomiting. He was reportedly lying on cardboard
 with a blanket and had no obvious trauma. Per EMS, the patient was febrile,
 tachypneic, and tachycardic. He was able to speak but unable to give history.

 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 21:53
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with 1 day earlier, there is possible subtle improvement in the right
 base and left mid zone opacities.  Otherwise I doubt significant interval
 change.
 
 ET tube, NG tube and right subclavian central line are similar in
 configuration.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is possibly minimally improved, as are
 inspiratory volumes.  Retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation persist.  Diffuse infiltrates in both lungs
 remain present, slightly improved as described above.  No gross effusions
 identified, though small effusions might not be apparent.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse infiltrates, slightly improved compared with 1 day earlier, could
 reflect either infectious infiltrates or asymmetric pulmonary edema.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation persists.
