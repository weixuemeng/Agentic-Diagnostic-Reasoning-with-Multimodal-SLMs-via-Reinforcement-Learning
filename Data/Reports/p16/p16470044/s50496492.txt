 Right lower lung and mid left lung opacities are unchanged compared to 1 day
 prior.  Right upper lung opacities are mildly improved.  No pleural effusion. 
 Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  A right IJ central venous catheter terminates in lower SVC.  An
 enteric tube passes below the diaphragm.  An endotracheal tube terminates 3.2
