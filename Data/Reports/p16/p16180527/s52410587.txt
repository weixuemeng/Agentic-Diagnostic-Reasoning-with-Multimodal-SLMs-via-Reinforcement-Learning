 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:51 PM
  Interval development of mild pulmonary interstitial edema with ___ B-lines
  from ___ and new right basilar opacification.  With exception for
  aspiration event, this may represent worsening atelectasis or asymmetric
  dependent pulmonary edema.  Recommend clinical correlation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:38 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  New oxygen requirement, evaluate pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Since ___, mediastinal and pulmonary veins have increased in caliber, and
 there are new septal lines at the base of the right lung.  All these findings
 point to acute cardiac decompensation, although top normal heart size has not
 appreciably changed.  There is also greater heterogeneous peribronchial
 opacification in the right lower lobe.  This could be asymmetric edema since
 the right lower lobe is usually most severely affected.  I would maintain
 close surveillance to exclude concurrent right lower lobe pneumonia.
