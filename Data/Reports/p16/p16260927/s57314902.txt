                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman s/p pancreatic biopsy yesterday with RUQ pain
 presenting for evaluation for free air (upright).
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded.  Streaky opacities in the left lower lung are
 consistent with mild atelectasis.  There may be a small lung nodule at the
 right second anterior interspace.  No focal consolidation, edema, or
 pneumothorax.  The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The mediastinum is
 not widened.  No subdiaphragmatic free air on this upright image.  The
 partially imaged bowel gas pattern is nonspecific.  No acute osseous
 abnormality.  Bilateral prior shoulder tendon repairs are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No subdiaphragmatic free air.
 2.  Atelectasis.
 3.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
 4.  Possible small right pulmonary nodule at the right second anterior
 interspace.  Recommend conventional chest radiograph to further assess.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional chest radiograph to reassess possible right
 pulmonary nodule.
