                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with malignant effusion now with intermittent
 desat despite chest tube  // PTX? re accumulation?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, a moderate, partially
 loculated left pleural effusion has apparently slightly decreased in size. 
 Large left apical lung mass with contiguous lymphadenopathy in malignant
 pleural thickening appears similar to the recent study.  Diffuse interstitial
 abnormalities also persist, and may reflect pulmonary edema; lymphangitic
 carcinomatosis is an additional consideration in a patient with malignancy.
