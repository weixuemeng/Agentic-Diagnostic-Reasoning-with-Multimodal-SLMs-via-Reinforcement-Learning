                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia and malaise
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip
 terminates within the proximal right atrium, unchanged.  Marked cardiomegaly
 is unchanged.  Masses within the left upper lobe and left suprahilar region
 appear grossly unchanged as does widening of the superior mediastinal contour
 due to known lymphadenopathy.  There is moderate pulmonary edema, worse in the
 interval.  Small bilateral pleural effusions appear relatively unchanged. 
 Known left lower lobe lung mass is not well visualized on the current
 radiograph.  Patchy opacities within the lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema, slightly worse in the interval, with continued small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Similar appearance of left upper lobe and left
 suprahilar masses as well as superior mediastinal widening compatible with
 lymphadenopathy.  Known left lower lobe mass is not well visualized on the
 current radiograph.
