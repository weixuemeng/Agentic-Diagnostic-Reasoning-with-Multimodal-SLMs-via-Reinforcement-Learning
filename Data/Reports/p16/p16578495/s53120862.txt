                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is some persistent partially loculated left pleural effusion with
 loculated areas best seen on the lateral view projecting over the region of
 the fissure and posteriorly.   Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged, some of which can be accounted for by a known adenopathy.  There
 is no definite new consolidation.  Increased interstitial markings in the
 lungs may be in part due to chronic underlying interstitial show process and
 mild superimposed edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Known loculated left pleural effusion and mediastinal adenopathy. Probable
 mild edema.  No definite new focal consolidation.
