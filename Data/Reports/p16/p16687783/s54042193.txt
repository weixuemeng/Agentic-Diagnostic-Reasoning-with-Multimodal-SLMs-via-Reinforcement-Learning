                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough, fever and hypotension, here to evaluate for
 evidence of pneumonia or heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day at 10:21 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy with multiple metallic
 closure devices seen.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged with
 overlying streaky linear opacities compatible with bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Streaky opacities at the left lung base are also similar in appearance to the
 prior study, compatible with atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected on this single frontal view.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal in size, but stable.  The thoracic aorta is
 tortuous and partially calcified, as before.  There is no free air beneath the
 right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with bibasilar atelectasis. 
 No evidence of heart failure.
