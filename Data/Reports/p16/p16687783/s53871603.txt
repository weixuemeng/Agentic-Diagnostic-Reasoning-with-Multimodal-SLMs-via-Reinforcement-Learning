                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  New right IJ.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 10:47.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 There is interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous
 catheter terminating in the low SVC without findings to suggest pneumothorax. 
 Left base retrocardiac opacity appears increased, consistent with known left
 lower lobe collapse seen on preceding CT with small right pleural effusion. 
 Right basilar atelectasis/consolidation seen on preceding CT is not well
 appreciated on the current study.  There is no large right pleural effusion. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of right internal jugular central venous
 catheter terminating in the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Interval increase in left basilar/retrocardiac opacity which may be due to
 atelectasis/left lower lobe collapse.
