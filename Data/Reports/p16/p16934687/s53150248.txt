                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Possible right lung lesions.  Please place nipple markers.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.  
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is tortuous.  The main pulmonary
 arteries are probably enlarged.  The lungs are hyperinflated consistent with
 COPD.   Bilateral effusions are small.  The hemidiaphragms are flattened.  
 
 Multiple old posterior right-sided rib fractures are again noted.
 
 Increased opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally, right greater than left
 and in the right middle lobe are consistent with multifocal pneumonia.  There
 is no pneumothorax. 
 
 Followup in six weeks after treatment is recommended.
