                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are normal.  Previously present bibasilar lung opacities
 have nearly resolved with residual predominantly linear opacities remaining. 
 Upper lobe predominant emphysema is present, most severe in the left upper
 lobe, as well as small branching opacities in the periphery of the upper
 lobes, which appear to correspond to regions of chronic small airways disease
 on prior ___ chest CT.  The latter are nonspecific but could
 reflect chronic aspiration or atypical mycobacterial infection. Bones are
 diffusely demineralized, in keeping with the patient's advanced age.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar consolidation has essentially resolved with residual
 linear areas of atelectasis.  Severe upper lobe emphysema and peripheral small
 airways disease as described.
