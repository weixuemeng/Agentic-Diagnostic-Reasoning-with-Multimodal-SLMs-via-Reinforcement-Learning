                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  COPD with generalized weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The
 patient is rotated to the left.  There is thoracolumbar scoliosis.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is seen.  There is nodularity along the lateral right lung base,
 best seen on the frontal view, unclear whether this could relate to nipple
 shadow.  Recommend repeat with nipple markers and if finding does not
 correlate to nipple, would recommend nonurgent chest CT to assess for
 underlying pulmonary lesion.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  The aorta is calcified.  The bones are diffusely osteopenic,
 although there are old-appearing posterior rib fractures involving the
 multiple right-sided ribs from approximately levels of the posterior right
 fourth, fifth and sixth ribs with evidence of callus formation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Hyperinflated lungs suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with
 likely bibasilar atelectasis.  Ill-defined nodular opacity projecting over the
 lateral right lung base on the frontal view could relate to a nipple shadow,
 thus recommend repeat with nipple markers.  If finding does not correlate with
 the nipple markers, then chest CT would be recommended to assess for
 underlying pulmonary nodule.
 
 2.  Multiple old posterior right-sided rib fractures.
