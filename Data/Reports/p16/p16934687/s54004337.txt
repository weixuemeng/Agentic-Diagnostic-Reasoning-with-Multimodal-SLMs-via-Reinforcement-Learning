  IMPRESSION:  
  
  1.  Severe emphysema.  
  
  2.  Streaky new opacification at the right lung base with volume loss,
  worrisome for atelectasis or perhaps pneumonia.  
  
  3.  Small pleural effusions.  
  
  4.  Convex right lower mediastinal contour, which may represent enlarged
  central pulmonary arteries, as suggested before, but since it is difficult to
  exclude a mass or lymphadenopathy, chest CT is suggested in follow-up,
  preferably with intravenous contrast, if possible.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and recent trauma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is volume loss at the right lung base with rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures and streaky new medial right basilar opacification
 suggesting substantial atelectasis.  Pulmonary architecture is highly
 irregular with relative lucency in the upper lungs, most consistent with
 emphysema, and the chest appears hyperinflated.  Although it may be an
 artifact associated with the way in which the cardiac and mediastinal
 structures are rotated to the right, there is a newly apparent convex contour
 to the right mediastinum.   The lateral view suggests very small pleural
 effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  The bones appear demineralized.
