                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, increased oxygen requirement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous and diffusely
 calcified. Hilar contours are unchanged with possible mild enlargement of the
 pulmonary arteries. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and attenuation of the
 pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices compatible with underlying
 emphysema.  Linear opacities within the lung apices likely reflect areas of
 scarring. Streaky opacity within the left lung base may reflect atelectasis.
 No large pleural effusion is demonstrated. No pneumothorax is seen though the
 left apex is obscured by the patient's chin projecting over this region.
 Multiple remote right-sided rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Emphysema.  Left basilar streaky opacity, likely atelectasis, though infection
 is not completely excluded.
