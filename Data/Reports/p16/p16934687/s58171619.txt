                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 835
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old, evaluate for worsening pneumonia, pulmonary
 edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable erect chest film ___ at 835 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Hyperinflation of the lungs with associated parenchymal distortion and
 biapical linear opacities, all likely related to known underlying emphysema. 
 Patchy opacities at both bases may reflect areas of atelectasis, although
 aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Heart is stably enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are notable for a
 prominent pulmonary artery which may reflect underlying pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No pneumothorax.  Blunting of
 both costophrenic angles may reflect small effusions versus chronic pleural
 thickening.
