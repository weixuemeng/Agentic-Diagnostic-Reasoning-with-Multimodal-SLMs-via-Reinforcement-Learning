                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  History of aspiration with recent admission for pneumonia, now
 presenting with lethargy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is perihilar fullness with a
 new widespread mild interstitial abnormality, which includes fairly prominent
 patchy perihilar opacities.  On the other hand, dense left basilar
 consolidation has nearly cleared.  However, there are new patchy right basilar
 opacities in addition to background interstitial prominence.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval clearance of left basilar consolidation.  
 
 2.  Patchy right basilar opacities, which could be seen with minor
 atelectasis, but given the context clinical correlation is suggested regarding
 any possibility for recurrent or new aspiration pneumonitis at the right lung
 base.
 
 3.  Increased new interstitial abnormality, suggesting recurrence of fluid
 overload or mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema; aspiration could also be
 considered.  Inflammation associated with atypical infectious process is
 probably less likely given the waxing and waning presentation.
