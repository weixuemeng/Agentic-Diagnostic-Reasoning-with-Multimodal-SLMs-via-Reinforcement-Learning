 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the hand of the patient
 obscures the lower half of the left chest.  There is enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels,
 consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, superimposed basilar pneumonia could be considered.
