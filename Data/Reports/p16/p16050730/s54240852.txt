                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Opacities at the right lung base have decreased compared to the
 preceding radiographs from ___ and ___.  The
 remainder of the lungs are clear.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 suggests a tiny effusion.  There is no definite left-sided effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Decreased right basilar opacities, likely resolving atelectasis.
 
 2.  Likely trace right pleural effusion.
