                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Epilepsy, cough, left-sided crackles.  Likely pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Moderately severe pulmonary edema has cleared from much of the lungs since
 ___ at 5:57 p.m.  However, there is more severe consolidation involving
 much if not all of the left lower lobe and some on the right projecting over
 the lower pole of the right hilus consistent with bilateral pneumonia,
 presumably due to aspiration.  Small left pleural effusion is presumed.  Heart
 is top normal size, decreased since the preceding study.  No pneumothorax.
