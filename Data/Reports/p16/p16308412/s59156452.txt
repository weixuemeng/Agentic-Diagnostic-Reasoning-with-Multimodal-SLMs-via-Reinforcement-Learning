                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic lung cancer, altered mental status and new
 oxygen requirement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PET-CT on ___, chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are new bibasilar opacities, greater on the left.  The left
 hilum is prominent.  The heart is normal in size.  A nodule in the right upper
 lobe corresponds to the FDG-avid right upper nodule identified on prior
 PET-CT.  Focal lucencies indicate that this lesion may be cavitated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New bibasilar opacities may represent peribronchial pneumonia.
 2.  Right upper lobe nodule is probably a metastasis and may have become
 cavitary since PET-CT on ___.
