                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Worsening pulmonary edema, preop lumbar fusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided.  Tracheostomy
 tube projects over the upper thoracic midline.  Lung volumes are low.  There
 is improved aeration within the lungs.  Minimal residual opacity is noted in
 the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure which could represent
 atelectasis or residual pulmonary edema.  The lower lungs are well aerated. 
 No effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  PEG
 tube projects over the upper abdomen.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall improvement in pulmonary edema.  Minimal residual opacity
 persists in the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure.
