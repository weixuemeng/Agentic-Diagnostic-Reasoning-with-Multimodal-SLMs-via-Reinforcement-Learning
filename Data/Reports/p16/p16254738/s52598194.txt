 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Desaturation, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is ongoing
 improvement of the known parenchymal opacities caused by multifocal pneumonia.
 At the bases of the left lung, however, a parenchymal opacity with a small
 left pleural effusion persists.  The opacity in the right upper lobe is also
 unchanged in extent and severity.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly without
 pulmonary edema.  Unchanged position of monitoring and support devices.
