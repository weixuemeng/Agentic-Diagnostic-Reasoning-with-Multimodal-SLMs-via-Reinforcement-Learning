 Lung volumes remain very low, and there is still substantial infrahilar
 atelectasis, left greater than right. The upper lungs are clear however. Heart
 is moderately to severely enlarged per there is no pulmonary edema. Pleural
 effusions are presumed, but not large.  There is no clear change in the
 positioning of either transvenous right atrial ventricular pacer defibrillator
 system or the epicardial lead projecting over the left heart.  There appears
 to be a left pleural drain, but no pneumothorax.
