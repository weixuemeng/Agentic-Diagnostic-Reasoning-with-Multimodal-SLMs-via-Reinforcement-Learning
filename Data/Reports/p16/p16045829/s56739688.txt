                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lead revision.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right ventricular lead is
 unchanged.  The right atrial lead has a somewhat different configuration,
 though the tip appears to be in appropriate position.
 
 Increased opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the
 left lower lobe and pleural effusion.
