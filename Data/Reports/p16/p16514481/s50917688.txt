                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure history with syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta appears dilated and tortuous. 
 Fullness of the superior mediastinal contour is also demonstrated without
 tracheal deviation.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Linear
 opacities in the left lung base likely reflect atelectasis.  Eventration the
 right hemidiaphragm is noted.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.  An
 electronic device is seen projecting over the midline left chest.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Tortuous and dilated aorta.
 
 2. Widening of the superior mediastinal contour could reflect a thyroid
 goiter.  Comparison with prior imaging is recommended, and if none has been
 obtained, a CT of the chest is suggested for improved assessment of the
 mediastinum and the aorta.
 
 3. Left basilar atelectasis.
