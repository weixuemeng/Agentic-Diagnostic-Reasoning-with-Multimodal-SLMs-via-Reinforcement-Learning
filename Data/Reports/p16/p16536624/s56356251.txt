                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, hypotension  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes and the patient appears somewhat kyphotic in
 position.  Low lung volumes cause vascular crowding although there may be a
 mild component of vascular congestion.  Perihilar opacities most likely relate
 to vascular congestion although underlying infectious process or aspiration at
 the left lung base or right perihilar region is not entirely excluded.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in
 technique and patient position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and patient in a somewhat kyphotic position the examination
 is slightly suboptimal.  Low lung volumes cause vascular crowding although
 there may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Right suprahilar and left
 infrahilar opacities may relate to pulmonary vascular congestion although
 infectious process or aspiration not entirely excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
