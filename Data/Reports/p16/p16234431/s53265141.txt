                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with edema versus
 hypersensitivity.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and ___.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusion is redemonstrated, slightly decreased since the
 prior study.  Additional improvement in the widespread parenchymal opacities
 demonstrated, most likely consistent with improvement of pulmonary edema. 
 Still present consolidations most likely in the lingula and right middle lobe
 are noted.  Continued surveillance with chest radiograph for documentation of
 complete resolution is recommended.
