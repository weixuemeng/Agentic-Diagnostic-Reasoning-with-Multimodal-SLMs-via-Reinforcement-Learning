                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Female with Tylenol intoxication.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since ___, diffuse, apex-to-base, heterogeneous,
 airspace opacification of both lungs has worsened. Many small round lucencies
 interspersed throughout the abnormality are likely due to emphysema, rather
 than cavitation, even though lung volumes are small. No change in small
 bilateral pleural effusions. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Severe, likely non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema or drug reaction, worsened
 overnight.  Infection alone is not likely to have progressed in this fashion,
 and cardiogenic pulmonary edema is less likely in the absence of other
 radiographic evidence of cardiac decompensation.
 2. No change in small bilateral pleural effusions from ___. 
 
 Dr.___ discussed the findings over the telephone with a member of the
 patient's care team on ___ at 1:30PM, within 15 minutes of
 observing the findings.
