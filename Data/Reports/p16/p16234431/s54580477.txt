                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with Tylenol overdose.  Status post
 NAC infusions.  Tachypnea for ___ to 40 minutes, saturating on room air.  Faint
 rhonchi on right base.  Assess for interval change, volume overload versus
 ARDS versus hypersensitivity.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Comparison is made to the next preceding portable single view chest
 examination of ___.  The previously existing hazy basal
 densities bilaterally have disappeared.  This most likely relates to patient's
 change in position as the previously portable chest examination in
 semi-upright position demonstrated at that time significant bilateral pleural
 effusion layering in the posterior pleural compartments.  In the upright
 position, pleural effusion is rather small which results in mild blunting of
 the lateral pleural sinuses.  Likewise, the pleural effusion in the posterior
 pleural sinuses is small and has significantly decreased when comparison is
 made with the AP and lateral chest examination of ___.  Frontal view
 now clearly demonstrates absence of any significant cardiac enlargement. 
 Uneven distribution of the pulmonary vasculature raises suspicion that the
 patient had significant emphysema in the past.  There are multiple perihilar
 patchy and poorly delineated perivascular infiltrates in both lungs.  The
 periphery of the lung parenchyma remains remarkable free.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax on the frontal view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreasing amount of pleural effusions, multiple bilateral
 perihilar patchy infiltrates similar to what existed before.  No cardiac
 enlargement.  Findings are not typical for  cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  The
 unusual presentation suggests the possibility of immune reaction in this
 patient with Tylenol overdose.  Further followup is indicated.
