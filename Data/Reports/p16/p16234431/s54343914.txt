                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size, is accompanied by
 pulmonary vascular congestion, diffuse interstitial edema, and more confluent
 perihilar and basilar opacities likely due to edema as well.  Moderate-sized
 bilateral pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.  Followup
 radiograph after diuresis may be helpful to confirm resolution and to exclude
 other co-existing process such as aspiration.
