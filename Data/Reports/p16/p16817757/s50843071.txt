                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting with chest pain.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and hyperlucent with flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms, consistent with chronic pulmonary disease, similar to ___. 
 Subtle increased opacity in the left lower lobe since ___ on the frontal view
 may reflect atelectasis as no corresponding opacity is appreciated on the
 lateral projection.  Mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged
 since at least ___.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Biapical, left
 greater than right pleural thickening is also unchanged.  The right lung is
 clear.  No mediastinal widening.  Tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta
 is unchanged.  Mild dextroconvex scoliosis of the upper thoracic spine is also
 unchanged.  Slight loss of anterior vertebral body height in a mid thoracic
 vertebral body is probably similar to the prior exam in ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left lower lobe atelectasis; no definite focal pneumonia.
 
 2.  Findings consistent with chronic pulmonary disease, similar to ___.
 
 3.  Mild loss of anterior vertebral body height in a mid thoracic vertebral
 body appears similar to ___.
