                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 There is increase in interstitial markings bilaterally, maybe due to chronic
 lung disease.  Opacity at the right lung base may represent slight eventration
 of the right hemidiaphragm, but underlying lesion is not entirely excluded,
 although felt unlikely.  The cardiac silhouette remains top normal to mildly
 enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  COPD.
 2.  Diffuse increase in interstitial markings may relate to chronic lung
 disease, although there may be a component of mild superimposed edema.
 3.  Somewhat rounded opacity at the right hemidiaphragm may in part relate to
 eventration of the right hemidiaphragm, but an underlying lesion is not
 excluded.  Recommend shallow oblique radiographs for further evaluation and if
 finding persists and remains unexplained, followup chest CT.
