                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post bronchoscopy, to evaluate interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no pneumothorax.  Obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm
 in this supine chest radiograph is likely due to a small right effusion.  A
 moderate-sized left pleural effusion is larger.  There is stable widening of
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette secondary to an enlarged heart and thoracic
 aortic aneurysm.  The endotracheal tube terminates 7 cm above the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube courses through the stomach and out of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New small right effusion and mild worsening of the moderate left
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
