                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increasing oxygen requirement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is some increased
 opacification at the left base, consistent with some residual pleural effusion
 and compressive atelectasis.  In the right lung laterally, there is an area of
 increased opacification just inferior to the minor fissure.  This could
 represent a fortuitous combination of pulmonary markings and overlying bony
 structures.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, this could
 represent a developing focus of infection.
