                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with r APICAL PNEUMOTHORAX small, thoracics
 requests one additional cxr to be done ___ AM to ensure stability before
 patient discharge.  h/o nsclc  // assess presence and degree of r apical
 pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent predominately apical right sided pneumothorax, this is
 unchanged in size when compared to the prior study.  A new opacity in the
 right mid lung likely relates to atelectasis due to this pneumothorax.  Small
 amount of pleural fluid on the right consistent with a hydro pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.  No left-sided pneumothorax seen. 
 The lungs remain moderately hyperinflated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change in the small right pneumothorax.
 
 A new nodular opacity, new compared to a prior study from 2 days ago a likely
 reflects an area of atelectasis, continued attention on followup is
 recommended.
