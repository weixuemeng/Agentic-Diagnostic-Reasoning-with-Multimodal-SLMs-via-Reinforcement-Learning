                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea.
 
 STUDY:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  This is likely
 due to the exaggerating effect of AP projection.  Mediastinal contours
 demonstrate scant calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aortic knob.  The
 lungs are clear of consolidation or pulmonary edema, but numerous pulmonary
 nodules are present.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A right
 humeral head anchor is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process; pulmonary nodules - correlate
 with prior imaging.
