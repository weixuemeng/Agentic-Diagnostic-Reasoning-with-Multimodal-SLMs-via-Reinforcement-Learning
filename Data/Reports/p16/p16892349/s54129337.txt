                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with fluid overload, aspiration, ARDS, interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 4.6 cm above the carina.  Right and left jugular lines are in
 adequate position.  The distal end off the NG tube is hard to assess due to
 its small caliber.  The patient had prior sternotomy for CABG with left-sided
 atrioventricular pacemaker.  Moderate pulmonary edema, moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly stable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  There is no significant change since previous exam.  Tube and lines are in
 adequate position.
 2.  Unchanged moderate pulmonary edema, moderate pleural effusions and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
