                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:38 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with ARDS.  Assess interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Worsening of generalized interstitial abnormality since 6:00 a.m. on ___,
 accompanied by slight increase in heart size, is probably cardiogenic
 pulmonary edema exacerbated by tracheal extubation.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 engorged and small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed.  There are no
 findings to suggest pneumonia, severe atelectasis or noncardiogenic edema. 
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads, in standard
 positions, and left internal jugular introducer ending at the origin of the
 SVC are unchanged in respective positions.  No pneumothorax.
