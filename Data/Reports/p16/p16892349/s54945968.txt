 INDICATION:  Patient with recent abdominal surgery.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 ET tube ends 6.7 cm above the carina.  There is a right jugular sheath ending

 overload has slightly improved since previous exam.  Small-to-moderate
 bibasilar atelectasis with overlying pleural effusion are unchanged.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  The patient has probably emphysema as shown on the chest
 x-ray of ___ where there were hyperinflated lungs and it explains
 the oligemia in upper lobes on today's exam.

 2.  Slight improvement of mild pulmonary edema.
 3.  Unchanged bibasilar atelectasis with layering pleural effusion.
