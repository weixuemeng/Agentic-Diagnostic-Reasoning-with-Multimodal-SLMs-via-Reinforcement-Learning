                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ARDS.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is
 slightly more prominent, though some of this may reflect obliquity of the
 patient.  Again there is pulmonary edema with areas with hazy opacification,
 especially at the left base, consistent with layering pleural effusion. 
 Bibasilar atelectatic changes are seen.  The monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged.
