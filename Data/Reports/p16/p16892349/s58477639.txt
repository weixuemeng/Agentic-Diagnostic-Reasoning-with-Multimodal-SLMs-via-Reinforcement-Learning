                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter has
 been removed.  The other monitoring and support devices remain in place. 
 Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and there are bilateral pleural effusions with
 compressive atelectasis at the bases, not much changed from the previous
 study.  Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.
