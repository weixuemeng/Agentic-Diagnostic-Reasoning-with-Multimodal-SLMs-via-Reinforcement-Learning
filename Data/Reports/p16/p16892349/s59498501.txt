                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for differences in
 patient positioning.  Although appearance of the chest is similar to the
 previous study performed approximately six hours earlier, there has been
 improvement in bilateral heterogeneous opacities affecting the right lung to a
 greater degree than the left when comparison is made to the earlier radiograph
 of ___ at 5:13 a.m.  A layering right pleural effusion has also
 apparently decreased in size.
