 pneumothorax or other sign of complications.  Bibasilar atelectasis is seen,
 left greater than right.  There is also a left pleural effusion.  Cardiac
 silhouette is slightly increased in size since prior imaging, consistent with
 recent extubation.  Sternotomy wires are again visualized.  Visualized osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
