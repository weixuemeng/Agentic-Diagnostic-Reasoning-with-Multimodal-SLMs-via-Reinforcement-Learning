                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from outside hospital from ___,
 and CT abdomen and pelvis from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature is suggestive of
 mild-to-moderate increase in central pulmonary venous pressure.  Bilateral
 small pleural effusions, left greater than right, are likely present. 
 Bilateral atelectatic changes, left greater than right, and an overlying
 pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration, must be excluded in the proper clinical
 setting.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Post-surgical changes
 are noted with median sternotomy wires and surgical clips.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema with bilateral small pleural effusions, left
 greater than right.
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis, pneumonia must be excluded in the proper clinical
 setting.
