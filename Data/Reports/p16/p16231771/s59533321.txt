                                 FINAL REPORT
 Chronic heart failure, fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Small left pleural effusion, bilateral relatively diffuse part
 alveolar and part interstitial parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting
 moderate fluid overload.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette, status post
 CABG, but relatively extensive retrocardiac atelectasis.  No interval
 appearance of new parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
