                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent CHF exacerbation, now failure to thrive.  Please evaluate
 for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison made to multiple chest radiographs, most recently
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable moderate cardiomegaly as well as prominence of the bilateral
 hila.  Faint patchy opacifications are noted throughout both lungs with
 relative sparing of the left upper lobe which may represent asymmetric
 clearing of pulmonary edema.  Bilateral effusions are decreased, now both
 small in size.  Retrocardiac opacity likely represents combination of
 atelectasis and effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse patchy opacifications  may represent residual asymmetric
 pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Recommend repeat
 imaging after further diuresis.
