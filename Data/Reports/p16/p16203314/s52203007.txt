                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Intubation interval study.
 
 CHEST:
 
 COMPARISON FILM:  ___.
 
 Heart remains enlarged.  The apparent increased opacification throughout the
 entire chest is likely due to underpenetration.  Right effusion is again
 noted, possibly increased.  Atelectasis is again noted.  Old fracture of the
 clavicle is noted.  Degenerative change, particularly in the right shoulder,
 is marked.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Underpenetrated film makes comparison difficult, although increase in right
 pleural effusions is probable.
