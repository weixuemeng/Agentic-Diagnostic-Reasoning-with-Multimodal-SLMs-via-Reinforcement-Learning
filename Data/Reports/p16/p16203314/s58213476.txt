 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, shortness of breath, questionable fluid
 overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of cardiomegaly and retrocardiac atelectasis as well as a small left pleural
 effusion.  Moderate atelectasis at the right lung base.  Overall, however,
 transparency of the lung parenchyma has increased and the vascular markings
 have decreased.  No evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. 
 No pneumothorax.
