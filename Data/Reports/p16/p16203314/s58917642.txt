                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  There is similar
 unfolding and calcification along the aorta.  Allowing for differences in
 technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is again a moderate eventration involving the anterior right
 hemidiaphragm.  What is new on this examination is patchy opacity in the
 posterior right lower lobe with suspected bilateral pleural effusions on each
 side.  The appearance includes slight fluid or thickening of the minor fissure
 on the right which is new.  Streaky left basilar opacities are nonspecific but
 could be seen with minor atelectasis.  Degenerative changes are similar along
 the thoracic spine.  Bony demineralization is suspected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New pleural effusions and patchy right lower lung opacity, which
 could be seen with atelectasis although in the appropriate setting pneumonia
 is not excluded.
