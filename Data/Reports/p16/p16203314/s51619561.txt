                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  CKD, new cough and bilateral crackles on exam.  Evaluate for CHF
 or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is right basilar atelectasis as well
 as a small, radiodense, well-circumscribed nodular opacity likely within the
 right posterior seventh rib, adjacent to a healing old rib fracture.  In
 addition, there is lung scarring adjacent to this finding.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  The
 aortic tortuosity is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
 2.  Pulmonary and skeletal changes associated with an old healing fracture of
 the right posterior seventh rib.
