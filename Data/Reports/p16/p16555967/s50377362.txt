 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Altered mental status.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There are low lung volumes that accentuate the cardiac silhouette though this
 has increased from prior study and attention in this should be paid in
 followup studies.  There is new mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  If any, there is a small right pleural effusion.  Minimal
 bibasilar atelectases are larger on the right side.
