                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough, near syncopal
 episode.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Small rounded nodular opacity measuring
 approximately 4 mm is again seen in the left mid lung, stable, likely
 representing calcified granuloma.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There is minimal basilar atelectasis. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There may be minimal
 pulmonary vascular prominence.  Metallic surgical hardware is seen in the
 visualized lower cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.  Otherwise, no
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
