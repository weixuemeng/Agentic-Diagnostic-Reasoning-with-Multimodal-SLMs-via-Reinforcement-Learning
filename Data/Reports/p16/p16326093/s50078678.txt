                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F admitted w/NSTEMI and CHF exacerbation having acute
 respiratory distress. Please assess for pulmonary edema  // Acute dyspnea    
 Acute dyspnea
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been little change there since ___. Mild to moderate
 pulmonary edema in the mid and upper lungs zones has not changed very much
 over the past several days.  The combination of dependent edema and
 atelectasis projecting over pleural effusions may explain apparent
 consolidation in the lower lobes, but I cannot exclude pneumonia. Mild to
 moderate cardiomegaly is stable. No pneumothorax.  Right jugular line ends in
 the low SVC.  No pneumothorax.
