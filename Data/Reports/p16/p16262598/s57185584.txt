                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with sob/cough  // sob, recent PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Left chest wall pacer device is
 again noted with pacer leads extending into the region the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  Midline sternotomy wires again noted.  Patient is known to
 have extensive calcified pleural plaque likely accounting for the areas of
 hyperdensity projecting over the left lung.  Since the prior exam, there is
 perhaps slight decrease in right pleural effusion.  Otherwise, no significant
 change in the appearance of the chest.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  Bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive calcified pleural plaque accounts for opacities projecting over the
 left hemi thorax.  Persistent though slightly decreased right effusion.
