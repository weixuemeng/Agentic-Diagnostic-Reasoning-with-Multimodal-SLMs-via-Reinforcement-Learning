 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with nasal packing and fever  // IC abscesS? PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Dual lead pacemaker is
 again noted with leads extending to the region of the right atrium and right
 ventricle. Midline sternotomy wires are noted. There is extensive calcified
 pleural plaque in the left chest which accounts for the irregular opacity seen
 on radiograph. There is a small right pleural effusion with probable mild
 compressive lower lobe atelectasis. No large pneumothorax. Heart size is
 top-normal contours unremarkable. Bony structures are intact. Inferior to left
 coracoid a well-defined ossific density is noted which reflect an old injury
 seen on CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion, right basal atelectasis, extensive left chest
 calcified pleural plaque.
