                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of chest appear underpenetrated, without
 evidence of consolidation. There is flattening of the diaphragms, which is
 unchanged. Increased retrocardiac opacification is consistent with a
 moderate-sized hiatial hernia. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  A dual-chamber pacemaker is in unchanged position.  Hardware in
 the right humerus is incompletely imaged. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
