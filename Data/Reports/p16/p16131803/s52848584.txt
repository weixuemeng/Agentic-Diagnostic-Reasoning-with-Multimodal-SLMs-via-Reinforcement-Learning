                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with CHF and crackles at the right base,
 evaluate for pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate stable mild cardiomegaly. 
 Mediastinal contour is unchanged and dual-chamber pacemaker, sternotomy wires
 and replaced valve are again noted and remain unchanged in position.  There is
 no pulmonary edema.  However, in comparison to the prior study, there is
 obscuration of the mid portion of the right hemidiaphragm and increased
 opacification at the right base.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Calcifications are seen along the aortic arch, degenerative
 changes in the thoracic spine and an intramedullary rod in the right humerus
 are also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacification at the right base with obscuration of the
 mid portion of the right hemidiaphragm may represent atelectasis or airspace
 consolidation and pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
