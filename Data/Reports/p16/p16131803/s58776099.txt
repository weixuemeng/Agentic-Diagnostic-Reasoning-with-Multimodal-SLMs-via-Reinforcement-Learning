                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weight gain, shortness of breath, peripheral edema.  Rule out CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral chest radiographs. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged since prior examination. 
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  Increased opacity at the right
 lung base could represent atelectasis, however underlying infection cannot be
 excluded.  There is no evidence of frank pulmonary congestion.  There is no
 pneumothorax. Note is made of a hiatal hernia and mitral annular
 calcifications.
 
 IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Right basilar opacity could
 reflect atelectasis, however underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
