                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, dyspnea after blood transfusion  //
 Evaluate for edema, worsening pleural effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 All there is alveolar opacity throughout much of the right lung, most
 pronounced in the mid and lower zones, with apparent air bronchograms and
 maturation of a right costophrenic angle and without aeration of right
 hemidiaphragm and its extreme lateral edge.  There is increased retrocardiac
 density, with obscuration left hemidiaphragm and probable air bronchograms,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and consolidation.  There is relative
 sparing of the left upper and mid zones.  Mild upper zone redistribution is
 noted on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacities, which are seen predominantly in the right mid and lower zones and,
 densely, in the left lower lobe.  While this could represent asymmetric
 pulmonary edema, the possibility of a superimposed infectious consolidation
 cannot be excluded.
 
 Upper zone redistribution on the left is noted.  On the right, the vessels are
 obscured by surrounding opacities.
 
 Possible small bilateral pleural effusions.
