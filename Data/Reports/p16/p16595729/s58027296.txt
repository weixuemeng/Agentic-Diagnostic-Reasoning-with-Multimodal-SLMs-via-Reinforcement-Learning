                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, new PICC line placement, 40cm right
 brachial  // Evaluate new PICC line
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ 08:19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC terminates in the region of the the cavoatrial junction, possibly
 overlying the upper right atrium.
 
 Bibasilar opacities are similar to before which may reflect atelectasis,
 however pneumonia is difficult to exclude.  There is near complete obscuration
 of the left hemidiaphragm.  Small left pleural effusion is similar to before. 
 There is no large right pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Lung
 slightly volume is low the film is obtained in lordotic position.  The cardiac
 silhouette is probably enlarged, but somewhat exaggerated by these technical
 factors.  Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette is exaggerated by the low lung
 volumes.
 
 There is mild upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora improved
 compared with ___.  .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right PICC terminates in the region of the cavoatrial junction -- please see
 comment above.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Bibasilar opacities are similar to before which may reflect atelectasis,
