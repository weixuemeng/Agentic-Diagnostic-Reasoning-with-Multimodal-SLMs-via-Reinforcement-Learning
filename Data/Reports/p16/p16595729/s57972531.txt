                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis, GI bleed, edema, complaining of
 chest pain  // volume overload
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray examination from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly as well as prominence of the superior mediastinum. 
 This appears more pronounced than on the prior examination, but is also
 accentuated by lordotic positioning.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution with alveolar opacities at both lung bases,
 including retrocardiac opacity that obscures the left hemidiaphragm.  A tiny
 left effusion would be difficult to exclude.  The degree of opacity at the
 right base is very slightly improved.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears larger, but is likely accentuated by
 lordotic positioning.
 
 Findings compatible with pulmonary edema, including bibasilar alveolar
 opacities.  Possible minimal interval improvement at the right base.  As
 before, the presence of superimposed infectious consolidation at the lung
 bases, particularly on the left, would be difficult to exclude.
