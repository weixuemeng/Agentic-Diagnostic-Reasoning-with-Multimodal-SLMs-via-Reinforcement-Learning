                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with GIB and NSTEMI  // Acute cardiopulmonary
 process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is marked cardiomegaly, probably not significantly changed.
 
 Also again seen is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, which
 may be slightly worse.
 
 There has been interval improvement in the degree of opacification at the left
 lung base.  There is residual left base atelectasis and a residual small left
 effusion.
 
 Hazy opacity at the right base, slightly increased, may reflect CHF and
 increased atelectasis.  No frank consolidation or gross effusion seen at the
 right lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable slight increase in CHF.
 
 Partial interval improvement of left lung base collapse/consolidation and
 effusion.  Residual atelectasis and small residual amount of left pleural
 fluid remain present.
 
 No frank consolidation or gross effusion at right base, though atelectasis and
 vascular engorgement have probably increased.
