                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new SOB, evaluate for volume overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Airspace opacification of bilateral lung bases, particularly on the right, has

 edema or developing consolidation.  Pulmonary vascular congestion has also
 increased and there small pleural effusions, likely new.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased airspace opacities, worsening pulmonary vascular congestion, and new
 small bilateral pleural effusions suggest worsening pulmonary edema.  A
 superimposed consolidation, particular within the right lung base, cannot be
 entirely excluded.
