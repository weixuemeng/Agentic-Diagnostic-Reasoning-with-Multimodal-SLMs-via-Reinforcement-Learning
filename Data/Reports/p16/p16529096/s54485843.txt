                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with leukocytosis, colon CA  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction in appropriate
 position.
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The heart
 is normal in size. The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Focal opacity in right lower
 lobe partially obscuring the right hemidiaphragm posteriorly is best seen on
 the lateral view. There is no no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Focal right lower lobe opacity could potentially represent an early focus of
 pneumonia. Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
