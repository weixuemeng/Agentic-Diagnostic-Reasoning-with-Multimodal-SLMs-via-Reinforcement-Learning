                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for developing pneumonia in a patient with tachycardia,
 increased respiratory rate, and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___,
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a right chest wall port
 with the catheter terminating in the upper right atrium.  Lung volumes are
 low, with exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette.  There is increasing patchy
 opacity in the bilateral lower lobes, some of which could be atelectasis, but
 are also concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  There is no appreciable pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing patchy opacities in the bilateral lower lobes, which could be in
 part due to atelectasis given lower lung volumes, but are also concerning for
 multifocal pneumonia.
