                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HCAP, continued tachypnea, low grade fevers
 on broad spectrum antibiotics.  Evaluate for fluid overload and pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison the prior study, lung volumes remain low and there is linear
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Heterogeneous opacification of the retrocardiac region
 has slightly worsened since the prior radiograph.  Additionally, right-sided
 effusion is slightly larger.  Heart size is stable.  Right chest wall catheter
 appears to terminate over the deep right atrium, however this may appear
 falsely low secondary to the low inspiratory level.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph, increase in opacification of the left lung base
 could reflect worsening atelectasis or infectious pneumonia.  Apparent slight
 increase in right pleural effusion and adjacent basilar opacification.
