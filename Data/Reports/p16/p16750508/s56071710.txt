                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of syncopal episode.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  There is prominence of the hila and central pulmonary
 vasculature.  Over the posterior right eighth rib/anterior right third rib,
 there is a 5-mm nodular opacity not clearly seen on prior chest radiograph;
 however, could potentially represent bone island seen on prior chest CT from
 ___, although on that study it was in the ninth rib.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes with likely moderate pulmonary vascular congestion/mild
 pulmonary edema.  5-mm nodular opacity projecting over the right mid lung, at
 the level of the posterior right eighth rib/anterior right third rib, could
 possibly represent a bone island that was seen in the ninth rib on prior chest
 CT of ___.  However, given the uncertainty whether this is the same
 finding, findings could be further evaluated on chest CT.
