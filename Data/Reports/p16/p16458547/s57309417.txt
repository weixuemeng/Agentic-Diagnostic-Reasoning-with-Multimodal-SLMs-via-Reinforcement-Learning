                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough/fever for several days concern for ___
 bacterial infection  // Evaluation for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Subtle right infrahilar opacity is worrisome for pneumonia.  Recommend
 followup to resolution.  Slight prominence of the right hilum could relate to
 underlying associated mild lymphadenopathy.  Linear opacity in the medial
 right mid lung suggests subsegmental atelectasis/scarring.  The left lung is
 clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The heart is normal in
 size.  Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right infrahilar opacity worrisome for pneumonia.  Recommend followup to
 resolution.
