 laparotomy for small bowel obstruction, now with tachypnea.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The pacemaker lead terminates in the
 expected location of the right ventricle.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged including cardiomegaly.  Bilateral pleural effusions are large,
 unchanged.  Widespread parenchymal opacities, bilateral, are unchanged and
 most likely represent a combination of infectious process and pulmonary edema.
 There is interval progression of right mid lower lung consolidation highly
 concerning for infectious process.
