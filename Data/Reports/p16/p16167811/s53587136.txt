                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with recent abdominal surgery.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is an endotracheal
 tube in place with its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric
 tube extends well into the stomach.  ICD extends to the region of the apex of
 the right ventricle.
 
 The overall appearance is quite similar to that of 12:17.  There are bilateral
 areas of opacification.  At the left base, this is consistent with volume loss
 in the lower lobe and pleural effusion.  There is evidence of some elevation
 in pulmonary venous pressure.  However, there may well also be some
 supervening pneumonia, especially at the bases, if the patient has appropriate
 clinical symptoms.
