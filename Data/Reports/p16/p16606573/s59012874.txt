                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There are low lung volumes with crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is noted.  Streaky opacities
 in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  Minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic angles suggest the presence of a small pleural effusions.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  No free air is seen under the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. Small
 bilateral pleural effusions. No free air under the diaphragms.
