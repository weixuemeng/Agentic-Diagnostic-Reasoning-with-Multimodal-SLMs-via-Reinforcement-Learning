                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Palpitations, atrial fibrillation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest CTA and chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is increased compared to the previous exam.  Mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  Worsening diffuse interstitial opacities with
 associated ground-glass opacities in predominantly the perihilar and bibasilar
 regions are seen, with new bilateral small pleural effusions.  More focal
 opacification in the retrocardiac region also is present.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening diffuse interstitial opacities with new small bilateral pleural
 effusions and increased cardiomegaly likely reflect superimposed mild to
 moderate pulmonary edema on a background of known interstitial lung disease
 which previously was possibly attributable to drug reaction, COPD or
 vasculitis.  More focal opacification in the left lung base is concerning for
 infection or aspiration.
