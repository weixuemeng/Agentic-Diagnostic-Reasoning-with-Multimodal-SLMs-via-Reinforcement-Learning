                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with history of previous abnormal chest CT with
 new interstitial lung disease.  The patient now presents with wheezing and
 productive cough for the last 48 hours.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Chest, PA and lateral.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  Again noted
 are diffuse, reticulonodular opacities, denser in the lower lungs.  There is
 also increased linear opacities in the right lower lobe.  There is a small
 right pleural effusion.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no
 pulmonary edema, however pulmonary vascular engorgement is noted.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Persistent reticulonodular opacities, with the recent chest CT
 demonstrating multiple stable pulmonary nodules with new diffuse interstitial
 lung disease raising the possibility of amiodarone toxicity, cryptogenic
 organizing pneumonia, or vasculitis.
 
 2. A new acute infectious process would be very difficult to exclude in the
 background of such extensive interstitial lung disease.
