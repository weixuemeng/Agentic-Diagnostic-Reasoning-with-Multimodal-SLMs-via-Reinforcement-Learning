                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of AFib on Coumadin, aortic stenosis, please evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Severe cardiomegaly persists.  There is overall stable bilateral
 pulmonary vascular congestion, however, with slight interval improvement of
 the mild bilateral pulmonary edema.  There has been interval worsening of the
 small bilateral pleural effusions, left worse than right as well as worsening
 of adjacent bibasilar consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Overall, worsening of small bilateral pleural effusions along with increased
 consolidation at the left lung base; this could be secondary to adjacent
 compressive atelectasis, however, an acute infectious process cannot be
 excluded.
