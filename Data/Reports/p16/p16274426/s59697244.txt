                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening shortness of breath, prior history of amiodarone use.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___, CT chest, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged with stable mediastinal and hilar
 contours.  There has been marked change compared to prior examination with
 widespread bilateral right greater than left nodular opacities as well as
 significantly increased reticular markings with peripheral and basilar
 predilection.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is
 unchanged hyperinflation of the lungs with biapical pleural thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal chest radiograph with separate findings of
 right greater than left multiple ill-defined nodular densities and increased
 reticular markings with peripheral and basal predilection.  The differential
 for these findings remain broad, and further evaluation with dedicated chest
 CT is recommended.
