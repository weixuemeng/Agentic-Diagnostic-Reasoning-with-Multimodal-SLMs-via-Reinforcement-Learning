  There is an increase in mild vascular congestion, with a more focal opacity at
  the right base, which may represent atelectasis, though in the proper clinical
  setting pneumonia or aspiration is a consideration.  Retrocardiac opacity is
  not significantly changed.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.
  Massive cardiomegaly is unchanged from the most recent radiograph, but
  significantly increased since ___ of this year.  -Results discussed with Dr.
  ___ at 945 PM on ___ via telephone by Dr. ___ at the time the
  findings were discovered.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 6:42 P.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, question pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, which has worsened progressively
 since ___, is subsequently unchanged.  There could be a substantial
 pericardial effusion responsible for some of that change.  Small left pleural
 effusion is stable.
 
 Since ___, widespread heterogeneous pulmonary opacification has
 developed.  This could be asymmetric pulmonary edema, but multifocal
 pneumonia, particularly dense in the left lower lobe, is at least as likely. 
 No pneumothorax.
