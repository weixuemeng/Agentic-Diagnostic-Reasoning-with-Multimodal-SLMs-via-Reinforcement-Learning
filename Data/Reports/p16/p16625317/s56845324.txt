 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Increased bilateral lower extremity swelling, change in pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, signs suggestive of
 centralized pulmonary edema are improved but still visible.  They are more
 extensive on the right than on the left.  In addition, the bilateral small
 pleural effusions persist, they are better visible on the lateral than on the
 frontal image.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.  No newly appeared focal
 parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
