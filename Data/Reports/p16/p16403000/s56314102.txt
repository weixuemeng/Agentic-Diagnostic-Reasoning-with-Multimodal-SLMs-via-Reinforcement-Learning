                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ___ ___ syndrome  // intrapulmonary
 process?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays dated ___ at 09:04.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, the tip lies at the level of the mid clavicular heads,
 approximately 6.5 above the Carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending and
 beneath diaphragm, off film. The sideport, if present, is not well visualized.
 A left PICC line is present, tip over distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected.
 No obvious mediastinal air is identified.
 
 There are slightly low inspiratory volumes, with patchy opacity at the left
 lung base, obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, and a small amount of patchy
 opacity at the right base. Probable small left effusion. Upper zone
 redistribution, but no overt CHF--___ may be accounted for by low lung
 volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities left greater than right. While this may represent
 atelectasis, the extent raises the possibility of aspiration or pneumonic
 infiltrate. Small left effusion also present. The overall appearance is not
 significantly changed compared with chest x-ray from ___ at 09:04.
 
 Upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF --? Due to low lung volumes.
