                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chest tube for R hepatic hydrothorax  //
 ?tube position and amount of pleural fluid
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 19:10.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study and allowing for differences in positioning, there
 is a small right to moderate pleural effusion which has probably increased in
 size, in with underlying atelectasis.  There has been interval obscuration of
 the right hemidiaphragm.  The right lung base catheter is again noted, though
 its relative position is difficult to evaluate.
 
 Increased retrocardiac density at the left base has increased, consistent with
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion is also
 slightly larger.
 
 Doubt significant CHF.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged
 allowing for  differences in positioning.  Right upper quadrant TIPS catheter
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Probable interval increase in right pleural effusion and underlying
 atelectasis.  Please see comment above.
 2. Increase in patchy opacity at left base,, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, with newly visible small  left pleural
 effusion.
