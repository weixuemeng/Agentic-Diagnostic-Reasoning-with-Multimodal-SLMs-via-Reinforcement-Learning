                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left hepatic hydrothorax, increasing in size
 on ___ CXR.  // Reevaluate size of left pleural effusion.      Reevaluate
 size of left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued hazy
 opacification at the right base consistent with extensive pleural effusion and
 underlying compressive atelectasis. It is difficult to assess whether there
 has been any change in the degree of effusion, since it is unclear whether
 there has been any difference in patient position. The left lung is
 essentially clear.
 To more accurately assess the degree of pleural effusion, lateral decubitus
 view could be considered.
