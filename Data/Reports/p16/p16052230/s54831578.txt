                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Extensive esophageal varices account for the widening
 of the mediastinal contour inferiorly.  A small right pleural effusion has
 decreased in size compared to the previous study with continued compressive
 right basilar atelectasis.  Minimal atelectasis is also noted in the left lung
 base.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pneumothorax is detected.  TIPS
 stent is imaged within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  Compression
 deformity of the low thoracic vertebral body remains unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decreased size of small right pleural effusion with continued right basilar
 compressive atelectasis.  Minimal atelectasis in the left lung base.
