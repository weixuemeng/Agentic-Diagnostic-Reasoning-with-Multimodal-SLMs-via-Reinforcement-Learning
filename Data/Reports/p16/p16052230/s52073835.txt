                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with cryptogenic cirrhosis c/b variceal bleeding s/p TIPS
 (___), ascites, hepatic encephalopathy requiring high doses of lactulose, and
 recurrent right hepatic hydrothorax who presents with worsening
 encepathalopathy now with rising WBC count and possible developing left-sided
 pneumonia on admission CXR.  // Assess for interval change, acute process
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Chest radiograph, PA and lateral views
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The opacity at the lower left hemithorax could be secondary to superimposition
 of soft tissue structures such as gynecomastia seen on prior CT.  No new areas
 of consolidation is identified.  Small to moderate right pleural effusion is
 stable in size.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal size.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No new areas of consolidation is identified.  Opacity at the left lower
 hemithorax could potentially be secondary to superimposition of soft tissue
 structures of the chest wall in this patient with evidence of gynecomastia
 seen on prior CT.  If there is continued high clinical suspicion for
 pneumonia, a non-rotated repeat chest radiograph could be obtained for better
 evaluation of this region.
 
 Persistent right pleural effusion.
