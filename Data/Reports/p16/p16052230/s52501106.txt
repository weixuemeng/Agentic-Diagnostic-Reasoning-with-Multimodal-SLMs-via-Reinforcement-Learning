                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with hepatic encephalopathy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___,
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and slightly lower lung volumes compared to ___.  A
 moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged.  There is slightly increased
 opacity at the left lung base, unclear if this is due to atelectasis versus
 mildly increased edema versus an early developing pneumonia.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased mild pulmonary edema.  Mildly increased opacity at the left lung
 base, unclear if this is superimposed atelectasis versus an early developing
 pneumonia.
 2. Unchanged moderate right pleural effusion.
