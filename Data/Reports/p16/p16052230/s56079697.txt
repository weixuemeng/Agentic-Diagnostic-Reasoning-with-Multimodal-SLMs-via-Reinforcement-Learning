 concern for rib fractures, new O2 requirement  // Please eval for 1)rib
 fractures 2) PNA vs atelectasis/poor effort     Please eval for 1)rib

 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion layers superiorly probable because of non erect
 positioning.  No pneumothorax.  Left lung grossly clear.  Heart size normal.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such
 abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is
 clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings  should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
