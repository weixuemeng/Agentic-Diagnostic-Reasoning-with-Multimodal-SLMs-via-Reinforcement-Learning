 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 thoracocentesis. The pre-existing right pleural effusion has moderately
 decreased in extent. The small amount of pleural fluid is still visible. There
 is a diffuse opacity of the re-expanded right lung parenchyma, likely
 reflecting re-expansion pulmonary edema.  At the bases of the right lung,
 additional areas of atelectasis are seen. Unchanged appearance of the left
 lung. Given the reduction of right pleural fluid, the mediastinum is returned
 in normal position. The feeding tube is showing an unchanged course.
