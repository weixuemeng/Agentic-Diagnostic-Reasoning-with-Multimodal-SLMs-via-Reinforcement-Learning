 appear to have significantly increased.  There is overlying right base
 atelectasis, right base consolidation is difficult to exclude.
 Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion is seen.  Opacity at the left
 costophrenic angle may be due to atelectasis or consolidation ; no pleural
 effusion is seen on the lateral view.  Cardiac silhouette is not well assessed
 given bibasilar opacities.
