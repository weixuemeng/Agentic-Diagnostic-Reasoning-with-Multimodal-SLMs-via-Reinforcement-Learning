                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cryptogenic cirrhosis, now with altered mental status, thick
 secretions.  Rule out focal infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, compared with the prior film, there
 is now a large right effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation
 and patchy opacity at the left lung base.  Probable mild vascular plethora. 
 Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle, but no gross left effusion.  
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette difficult to assess due to rotation.
 
 An enteric tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Interval development of large layering right effusion, presumably with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Possible patchy opacity in the left
 lower lobe.  Suspect mild vascular plethora.
