                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with right hepatic hydrothorax, diuresing.  //
 Evaluate for interval change in right pleural effusion.      Evaluate for
 interval change in right pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 07:50
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 09:16 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is a moderate to large right-sided pleural effusion with substantial
 volume loss in the right lower lung with probable collapse of the right middle
 and a portion of the right lower lobes.  The left lung remains well inflated
 and clear.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  A feeding tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Assessment of the cardiac
 and mediastinal contours is difficult given due to marked patient rotation on
 the current study.  Overall, when compared to the most recent prior study,
 there is no significant interval change.
