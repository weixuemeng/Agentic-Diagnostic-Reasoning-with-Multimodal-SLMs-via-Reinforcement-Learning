                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Peristent cough and chest congestion.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  There are persistent opacities in the right lower
 lobe, increased from prior.  There is unchanged rounded appearance of the
 right hilum.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Opacities are
 better seen in the frontal view; in the lateral view, are difficult to
 evaluate.  There are severe degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 CT is recommended for further evaluation of the right hilum and persistent
 opacities in the right lower lobe and persistent clinical symptoms of cough
 and chest congestion.
