                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cirrhosis, GI bleed, intubated for airway protection. 
 Patient with hypoxia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis have worsened on the right. 
 Cardiomegaly is obscured by the lung abnormalities.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions are small.  
 Left perihilar opacity has worsened, likely worsening atelectasis, but
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  When clinically appropriate,
 conventional frontal and lateral views are recommended.  
 
 Right PICC tip is in the cavoatrial junction.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the
 right atrium.  NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.  ET tube is 5.8
 cm above the carina, lies against the right wall of the trachea.  There is no
 evident pneumothorax.
