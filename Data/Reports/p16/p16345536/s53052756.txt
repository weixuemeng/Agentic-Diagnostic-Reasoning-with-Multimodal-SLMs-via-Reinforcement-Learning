                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 2:52 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with an upper GI bleed, intubated and sedated. 
 Check ET tube position and interval changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower, exaggerating the mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema
 which has worsened.  New opacification highlighting the minor fissure in the
 right lung could be fissural pleural effusion or alternatively right middle
 lobe consolidation or focal atelectasis.  Cardiac silhouette is partially
 obscured by the elevated lung bases, but appears to have enlarged.  The
 caliber of dilated mediastinal veins is unchanged.  Thoracic aorta is
 tortuous, probably generally large, but cannot be assessed for a focal
 aneurysm on this study.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement at the thoracic inlet.  Right PIC and right
 internal jugular lines end in the low SVC.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 9:58, one minute following recognition of the new
 radiographic findings.
