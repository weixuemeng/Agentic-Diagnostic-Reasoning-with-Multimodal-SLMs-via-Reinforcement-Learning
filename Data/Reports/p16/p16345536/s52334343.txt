                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pulmonary edema or pleural effusion in a patient
 with upper GI bleed, intubated for airway protection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates stable low lung
 volumes as well as marked bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.  Although there
 are persistent findings consistent with hypervolemia, such as marked dilation
 of the azygos vein, the mild interstitial pulmonary edema seen on the prior
 radiograph has improved somewhat.  Clearance of the edema has revealed
 heterogeneous opacities in the left upper lobe which may also be due to
 atelectasis, however, other causes such as underlying pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  There is possibly a small effusion on the left, if any.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  An endotracheal tube
 terminates no less than 4.5 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube
 terminates in the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent mild hypervolemia with interval improvement in mild pulmonary
 edema.
 2.  Marked bibasilar atelectasis and probable left upper lobe atelectasis,
 which should be evaluated with conventional PA and lateral radiographs as soon
 as feasible.
