                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with upper GI bleed, liver disease, and intubated
 for airway protection, assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube and right PICC are in appropriate position. 
 Since the prior radiograph, there has been little interval change with
 persistent low lung volumes and linear atelectasis or fluid along the right
 minor fissure and asymmetric left greater than right pulmonary opacities which
 is likely retrocardiac atelectasis. Mediastinal silhouette remains unchanged
 with engorgement of pulmonary vessels.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall unchanged examination with persistent low lung volumes
 and retrocardiac atelectasis.
