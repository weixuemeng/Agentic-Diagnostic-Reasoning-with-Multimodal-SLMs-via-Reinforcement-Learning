                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess ET tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier.
 
 ET tube tip is 1.5 cm above the carina could be withdrawn couple of
 centimeters for more standard positioning.  Severe cardiomegaly and widened
 mediastinum are stable.  Right lower lobe opacities have increased consistent
 with increasing atelectasis and effusion.  Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema
 is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
