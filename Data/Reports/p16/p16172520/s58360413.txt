                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess NG tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm, passing to the stomach.  ET
 tube tip is 2.8 cm above the carina.  Worsening opacities in the right lower
 lobe are consistent with large loss of volume in the right lower lobe. 
 Moderate pulmonary edema has improved.  There is no pneumothorax.
