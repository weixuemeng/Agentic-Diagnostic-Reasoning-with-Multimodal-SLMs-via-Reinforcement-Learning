                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 5:06 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with craniotomy, intubated, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 3:39.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest ___ at 5:06 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position.  There is
 diffuse bilateral interstitial abnormality which has worsened and is
 consistent with worsening mild-to-moderate interstitial edema.  The heart
 remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion
 should also be considered.  Increasing patchy opacities at both bases could
 reflect the worsening pulmonary edema, although aspiration or a superimposed
 bibasilar pneumonia should also be considered.  No pneumothorax.
