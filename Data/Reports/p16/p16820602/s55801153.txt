                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left apical abnormality on left shoulder radiographs.  Dedicated
 chest radiographs are being performed for further evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Shoulder radiograph ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Heart
 size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  The
 nodular opacity seen on the prior shoulder radiograph is likely due to
 hypertrophy and sclerosis at the left 1st rib costochondral junction. 
 Gynecomastia is again noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No concerning opacity in the left apex.
