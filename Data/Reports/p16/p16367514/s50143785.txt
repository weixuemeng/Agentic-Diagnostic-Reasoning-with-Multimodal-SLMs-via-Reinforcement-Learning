                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent Pleurx catheter placement with rapid fluid accumulation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right basilar chest tube is again noted.  There has been interval decrease in
 size of the right pleural effusion which is now small, with a trace left
 pleural effusion also noted.  The heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.
 The aorta remains moderately tortuous with diffuse atherosclerotic
 calcifications.  There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema which appears
 asymmetrically more pronounced on the right.  Streaky bibasilar opacities are
 likely reflective of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax. No acute osseous
 abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right basal chest tube in place with interval decrease in size of the right
 pleural effusion which is now small.  Trace left pleural effusion also noted. 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema which appears asymmetrically more pronounced
 on the right, with bibasilar atelectasis.
