                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal contour is unchanged
 with atherosclerotic calcification noted of the thoracic aorta.  Right basilar
 chest tube remains in unchanged position, with a similar appearance of the
 small right pleural effusion.  No large left pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is demonstrated.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases, more pronounced on the
 right, likely reflect atelectasis.  There is likely mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion with cephalization of pulmonary vasculature.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged appearance of small right pleural effusion with right basilar chest
 tube in place.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis with mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
