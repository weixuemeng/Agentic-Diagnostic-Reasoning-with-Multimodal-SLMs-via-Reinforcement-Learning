                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Mild respiratory difficulty, gurgling noises.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right-sided drainage catheter is now coiled in the posterior
 inferior right hemithorax, different in position as compared to the prior
 study when it terminated at the level of the right hilum.  The lungs remain
 hyperinflated.  There are bilateral, right greater than left small pleural
 effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Vascular congestion has somewhat
 decreased since the prior study.  There is subtle prominence of the hila
 likely due to vascular engorgement.  Basilar opacity is seen, increased since
 prior, which the differential diagnosis including aspiration, infection, or
 possibly combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Decreased vascular congestion with
 central vascular engorgement remaining.  
 
 2.  Right basilar chest catheter is coiled in the posterior inferior right
 hemithorax and is in different position as compared to the prior when it
 terminated at the level of the right hilum.
 
 3.  Left basilar opacity increased from prior with differential diagnosis
 including aspiration, infection versus less likely atelectasis overlying
 pleural effusion.
