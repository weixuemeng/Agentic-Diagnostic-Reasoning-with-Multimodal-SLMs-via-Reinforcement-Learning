                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p R thoracotomy with revision of
 esophagogastric anastomosis s/p chest tube removal.  Assess for interval
 change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to prior examination there is interval removal of right sided
 chest tube.  The lungs are persistently hypoinflated with crowding of
 vasculature and bibasilar atelectasis.  Small left and trace right pleural
 effusions are stable.  No left pneumothorax.  Tiny right apical pneumothorax
 has near completely resolved.  Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are
 unremarkable.
 
 Left port tip is in the mid SVC.  Again seen are clips along the right chest
 wall consistent with right thoracotomy.  Small amount of residual contrast
 within the left upper abdomen and at the level of the diaphragmatic crus is
 unchanged since prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Status post removal of right-sided chest tube with near complete
 resolution of right apical pneumothorax.
 2.  Stable small left pleural effusion with stable retrocardiac opacity most
 consistent with combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion.
 3.  Stable trace right pleural effusion.
 4.  Small amount of residual contrast within the left upper abdomen and at the
 level of the diaphragmatic crus is unchanged since prior examination. 
 Assessment of location is limited.
