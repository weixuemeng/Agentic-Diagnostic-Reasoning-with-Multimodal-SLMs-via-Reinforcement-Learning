                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 Pulmonary hyperinflation is noted with generalized increased lung markings. 
 There is chronic pleural thickening in the left base, although the degree of
 additional opacification which likely represents atelectasis has resolved.  A
 faint nodular opacity projected on ___ radiograph is now not
 definitively seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable in size. 
 The lungs appear grossly clear.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Pulmonary hyperinflation, bronchial wall thickening, all
 unchanged from before, likely reflects COPD.
 
 Note, the patient's CTA examination is from ___.  Although no
 definitive or significant nodular changes noted on today's radiograph,
 followup CT would probably be appropriate, although not necessarily in the
 emergent setting,  given changes on that study.
