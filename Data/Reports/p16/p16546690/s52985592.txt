                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of chest pain, dysphasia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle right
 basilar opacity most likely represents confluence of vascular structures and
 possible underlying atelectasis, less likely consolidation.  The left lung is
 clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
