                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There are low lung volumes.  Minimal streaky opacities in
 the lung bases likely reflect atelectatic changes.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with probable mild atelectasis at the lung
 bases.
