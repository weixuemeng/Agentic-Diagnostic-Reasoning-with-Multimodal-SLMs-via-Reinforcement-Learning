                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is difficult to determine given the presence of a moderate size
 right pleural effusion, which appears relatively unchanged compared to the
 prior exam.  There is mild pulmonary edema, slightly improved compared to the
 previous exam.  Streaky left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis, with a
 right basilar opacity also likely reflective of compressive atelectasis.  A
 small left pleural effusion appears to be present.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Assessment of the lung apices is somewhat obscured due to the patient's chin
 projecting over this region.  No acute osseous abnormalities are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Moderate size right pleural effusion, similar compared to the prior exam,
 with trace left pleural effusion.
 
 2. Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect compressive atelectasis but
 infection is not excluded.
 
 3. Interval improvement in mild pulmonary edema.
