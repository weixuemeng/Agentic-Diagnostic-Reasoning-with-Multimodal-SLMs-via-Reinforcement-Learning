 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in
 extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion.  The lung volumes continue
 to be low.  Minimal fluid overload is present.  Apparent increased
 radiodensity at the left lung bases caused by the hands of the patient
 overlying the left pectoral region.  Moderate atelectasis at both the left and
 the right lung bases.
