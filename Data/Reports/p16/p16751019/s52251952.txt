                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of congestive heart failure with bibasilar crackles and
 hypotension.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, there is an increased right pleural effusion
 with associated right basilar opacity.  Additionally, obscuration of the left
 costophrenic angle is likely due to a small effusion and atelectasis.  There
 is no overt pulmonary edema.  The apices of the lungs are clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contour is normal.  The heart size is
 moderately enlarged, and unchanged from prior exams.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right than the left.
 2.  Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.  In the proper clinical setting,
 an infection would be difficult to completely exclude.
 3.  Stable cardiomegaly.
