                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ESRD, presenting with urosepsis, now resolved, but with new
 tachycardia, leukocytosis and persistent cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to prior study, there is persistent moderate-to-large
 right-sided effusion with associated right base atelectasis.  This in
 conjunction with low lung volumes makes determination of the cardiac
 silhouette difficult.  Atherosclerotic mural calcifications are again noted
 within the aortic arch.  There has been improvement in right greater than left
 asymmetric pulmonary edema with mild residual right-sided edema.  A focal
 increased area of consolidation in the right upper lobe may also be due to
 asymmetric edema, however, remains suspicious for pneumonia.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right pleural effusion.  Improved asymmetric edema
 with residual right-sided edema.  Right upper lobe consolidation may be due to
 edema, but is suspicious for pneumonia and continued surveillance is
 recommended.
