                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with atrial fibrillation now with rapid ventricular
 rate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes persist. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is mild to moderately enlarged, unchanged. The aorta remains tortuous
 and diffusely calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present with persistent focal
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Streaky opacities in the lung bases may
 reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. Assessment of the
 lung apices is somewhat obscured by the patient's chin and neck soft tissues,
 but no large pneumothorax is demonstrated. A vascular stent is seen within the
 region of the left subclavian and axillary vessels.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with streaky bibasilar airspace opacities, potentially
 atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude. Small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
