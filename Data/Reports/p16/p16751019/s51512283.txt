                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with tachycardia  // eval CHF, infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to prior, given differences in technique, there has been no
 significant interval change. Low lung volumes are again seen with crowding of
 the bronchovascular markings. Right basilar opacity is likely in part due to
 atelectasis although underlying effusion is suspected. Left costophrenic angle
 is excluded from the field of view. The cardiac silhouette is accentuated by
 the low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Right basilar opacity likely components of effusion and
 atelectasis as seen on prior.
