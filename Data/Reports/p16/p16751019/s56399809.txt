                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Endstage renal disease on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation on
 Coumadin.  Systolic heart failure.  Dyspnea.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest again demonstrate a large right
 pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  The left costal phrenic angle is
 blunted and an effusion is likely.  Partial collapse of the left lower lobe is
 redemonstrated, although superimposed infection is not excluded.  Compared to
 the prior radiograph from ___, there is more vascular congestion,
 especially in the left hilum.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large right-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  Left basilar
 opacity likely represents atelectasis, although infection is not excluded. 
 Mild increase in vascular congestion.
