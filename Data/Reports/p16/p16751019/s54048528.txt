                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph single-view.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low which accentuates the heart size and pulmonary
 vasculature.  Heart size is difficult to evaluate in the presence of a
 moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion which appears to have a small
 loculated fissural component unchanged appearance from prior study along with
 compressive right base consolidation which likely represents atelectasis
 however infection cannot be excluded given the appropriate clinical
 circumstance.  Very small left basilar atelectasis however the left
 costophrenic sulcus is not imaged.  There is mild increased asymmetric density
 of the right lung field which is likely layering fluid.  The superior lung
 fields are clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion similar in appearance to prior study with
 adjacent right base consolidation likely compressive atelectasis however
 infection cannot be excluded given the appropriate clinical circumstance.
