                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever, cough, sob  // eval for PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable semi upright view of the chest.   Lung volumes are markedly low
 which limits assessment. There is subtle increase in left basal opacity which
 could represent pneumonia. Mild bibasilar atelectasis also likely present. No
 overt edema. No large effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size remains prominent.
 Mediastinal contour is unchanged. A vascular stent projects over the left
 axilla. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis. Increasing left lower lobe
 opacity, may represent a developing pneumonia.
