                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lung volumes are exceedingly low. 
 Opacity at the right lung base is improved from prior and is likely a
 combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion.  Pneumonia cannot be entirely
 excluded.  There is improved aeration of the right upper lobe compared to
 prior.  Retrocardiac opacity may also reflect atelectasis but infection cannot
 be excluded, and there is likely a trace left pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 Heart is moderately enlarged.  A tortuous and calcified aorta is again noted. 
 There is mild distention of the stomach.
