                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two chest tubes remain in place in the left hemithorax, with a
 persistent moderate-sized partially loculated left pleural effusion.  Focal
 lucency adjacent to the chest tubes in the region of the left costophrenic
 sulcus could potentially represent loculated basilar pneumothorax.  Adjacent
 subcutaneous emphysema is present in left chest wall.  Persistent left
 retrocardiac opacity, likely due to atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive heart failure.
