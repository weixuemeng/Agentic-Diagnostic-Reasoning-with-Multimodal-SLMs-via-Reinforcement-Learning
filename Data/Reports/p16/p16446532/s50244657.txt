                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CM s/p dual chamber ICD.  // Rule out
 pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain low and the
 moderate cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta persists. Status
 post CABG and valvular replacement, left pectoral pacemaker. However, the
 transparency of the lung parenchyma has increased, likely reflecting improved
 ventilation. No pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia P minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic sinus, seen on the frontal radiograph only, might reflect a
 minimal left pleural effusion.
