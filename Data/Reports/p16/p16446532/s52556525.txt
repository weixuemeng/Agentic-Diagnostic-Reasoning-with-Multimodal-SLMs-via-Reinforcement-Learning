                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Followup after cardiac surgery.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, at 6:58 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The monitoring and support devices, including the left chest tube are
 constant.  Postoperative pneumopericardium is less evident than on the
 previous image.  There is a mild decrease in extent and severity of the
 pre-existing parenchymal opacities.  No new parenchymal opacities, minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially reflecting the presence
 of a minimal pleural effusion.
