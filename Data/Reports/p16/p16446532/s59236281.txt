                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There is slight increase in the opacification at the left base,
 consistent with a combination of atelectatic change, pleural effusion, and
 possibly low lung volumes.  No evidence of vascular congestion.
 
 The right IJ catheter has been removed.
