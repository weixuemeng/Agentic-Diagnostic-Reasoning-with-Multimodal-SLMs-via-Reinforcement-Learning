                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with thoracocentesis, evaluate for
 effusion and pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding similar study obtained five hours earlier during the
 same day.  Apparently, a left-sided thoracocentesis was performed as there is
 now clearly diminished left-sided basal density with partial visibility of the
 left-sided diaphragm.  Several linear densities indicating plate atelectasis
 remain.  No acute pulmonary infiltrates or masses in the left upper half of
 the left hemithorax.  No pneumothorax is identified.  The degree of
 mediastinal shift towards the right has decreased mildly but is generally
 still present.  Status post sternotomy, bypass surgery and mitral valve
 prosthesis placement, as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Successful left-sided thoracocentesis with diminished amount of
 fluid and no evidence of pneumothorax.
