                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of left-sided chest tubes, loculated
 hydropneumothoraces are present within a partially loculated left pleural
 effusion, but there is no evidence of apical pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable in appearance allowing for technical differences between
 the exams.  Multifocal atelectasis has partially improved in the left mid and
 lower lung regions, and note is also made of improved aeration in the right
 lower lobe.  Subcutaneous emphysema is present in the left chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Loculated left hydropneumothoraces within a partially loculated
 moderate-sized left pleural effusion.
