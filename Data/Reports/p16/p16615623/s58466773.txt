                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Former smoker presenting with complaints of palpitations.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are relatively hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms,
 which may be due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hyperinflated lungs, which can be seen in COPD.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
