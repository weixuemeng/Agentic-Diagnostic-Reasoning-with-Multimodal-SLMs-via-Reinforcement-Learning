 There is tortuosity of the descending aorta.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  There is mild irregularity of the cortical margin
 of the left ___ posterolateral rib.  No acute fracture is seen.  On an old CXR
 from ___ a slight irregularity of the cortical margin was also seen.  This
