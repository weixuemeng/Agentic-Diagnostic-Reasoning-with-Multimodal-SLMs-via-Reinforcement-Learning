  Diffuse gaseous distention of multiple loops of large and small bowel
  worrisome for ileus or obstruction. Consider dedicated abdominal imaging.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with infectious work-up, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Diffuse moderate to severe gaseous
 distention of multiple loops of large and small bowel is seen in the partially
 imaged abdomen, consider dedicated abdominal imaging for further evaluation of
 possible bowel obstruction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 Diffuse gaseous distention of multiple loops of large and small bowel
 worrisome for ileus or obstruction.  Consider dedicated abdominal imaging.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 3:17 PM, 5 minutes after
