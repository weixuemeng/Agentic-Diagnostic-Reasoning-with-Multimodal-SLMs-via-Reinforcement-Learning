                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dyspnea  // acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 19:30
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning with low inspiratory volumes.  This creates considerable
 differences in the appearance of the chest, compared to the prior film.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, likely accentuated by technical factors. 
 No definite CHF.  Minimal atelectasis at both bases, right-greater-than-left,
 is also likely related to low lung volumes.  No frank consolidation or gross
 effusion identified.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low inspiratory volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite CHF or focal
 consolidation.  No pneumothorax or gross effusion.
