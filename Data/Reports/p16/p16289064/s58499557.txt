 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. The heart is normal in size and there is no vascular
 congestion or pleural effusion.  There is a small amount of opacification in
 the left costophrenic angle, most likely reflecting atelectasis.  No definite
 evidence of acute focal pneumonia. However, in the absence of a lateral view,
 a retrocardiac consolidation would be difficult to unequivocally exclude.
