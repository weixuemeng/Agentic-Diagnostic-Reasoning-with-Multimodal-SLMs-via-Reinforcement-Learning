                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with eval ett  // ett
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 5.6 cm above the carina. An enteric tube
 descends below the field of view.
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Lung
 volumes are low which accentuates bronchovascular markings. Bibasilar
 opacities (left > right) suggests atelectasis however infection should be
 considered.  There is mild prominence of the bilateral pulmonary vessels.
 There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The osseous structures are
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as above.  Low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities are
 consistent with atelectasis however infection should be considered in the
 appropriate setting.  Minimal pulmonary vascular prominence.
