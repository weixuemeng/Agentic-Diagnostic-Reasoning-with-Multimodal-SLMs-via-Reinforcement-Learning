 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:51 PM
  Endotracheal tube ends 3.4 cm above the level of the carina.  The side port of
  the enteric catheter continues to be at the level of the gastroesophageal
  junction; recommend advancing.  The right internal jugular central venous
  catheter ends in the lower right atrium, not significantly changed.  A
  vertically oriented catheter projects over the mid abdomen, not seen on the
  prior radiographs from ___, possibly external to the patient;
  clinical correlation recommended.  Moderate pulmonary edema has increased
  compared to the prior radiographs from approximately ___.5 hr ago.  Asymmetric
  left lower lobe heterogeneous opacities could be asymmetric pulmonary edema,
  although infection in this region is certainly possible.  Findings were
  discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 22:51 via telephone on the day of
  the study, ___ min after discovery of the findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 ET tube is in standard position.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the right
 atrium.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The side port is at the EG junction
 and should be advanced for more standard position.  Severe pulmonary edema has
 increased.  Increased focal  opacity in the left lower lobe could be part of
 the pulmonary edema or pneumonia.  There is no evident pneumothorax or
 increase in pleural effusions.
