                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left clavicle swelling.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since prior exam, the patient is status post a right upper
 lobectomy.  Surgical clips are noted in the right hilum.  There is tenting and
 scarring of the residual right upper lobe with an apical bleb.  There is more
 opacification that what would be expected, particularly around the right
 hilum.  Ground-glass micronodular opacity in the right middle lobe is of
 uncertain chronicity, though may reflect an infectious or inflammatory
 process.  The left lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post a right upper lobectomy. There is more opacity than
 what would be expected for the usual post-operative change with additional
 ground-glass nodular opacities in the superior right middle lobe.  Recommend
 correlation with the CT.  These may represent an infectious or inflammatory
 etiology.  Recommend correlation with symptoms and prior imaging if available.
