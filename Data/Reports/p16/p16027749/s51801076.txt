 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views the chest provided.  Blunting of the right CP angle
 likely reflects mild pleural thickening.  Lungs are otherwise clear without
 signs of pneumonia, edema, or pneumothorax.  No large effusion seen. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable.  The imaged bony
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pleural thickening at the right lateral lung base, otherwise
 unremarkable.
