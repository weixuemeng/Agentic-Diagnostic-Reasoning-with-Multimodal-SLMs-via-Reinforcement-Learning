                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single-lead pacemaker is unchanged in position, with the lead
 terminating in the right ventricle.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable with mild tortuosity of the
 descending thoracic aorta.  The lungs are clear aside from unchanged left
 basilar atelectasis or scarring.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is
 no overt pulmonary edema.  Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are
 similar in appearance to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
