                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AVR, maze with fevers; question pulmonary process effusions.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  
 
 Lordotic positioning.  The patient is status post sternotomy. AVR faintly seen
 on the lateral view. 
 
 There is hyperinflation, suggesting COPD. There is cardiomegaly.  There is
 upper zone re-distribution and small bilateral effusions.  Left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation and patchy cardiophrenic opacity.  The uppermost
 sternal wire is fractured.  
 
 Portions of external fixation hardware noted.  Post-traumatic versus
 post-surgical changes of the right distal clavicle, with well-corticated
 distal edge.  
 
 Compared with ___, retrocardiac opacity and small left effusion are
 slightly worse.  The right costophrenic angle is better defined.  The upper
 zone redistribution may be slightly worse.  Interruption of the uppermost
 sternal wire is new.  Interval removal of right IJ central line noted.
