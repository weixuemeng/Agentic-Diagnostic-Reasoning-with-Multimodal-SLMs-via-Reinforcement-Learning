                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postop day five AVR, status post wire removal, question effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  There is prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, improved compared with ___.  There has also
 been some clearing of opacities of both lung bases and improvement in the
 right pleural effusion.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle is
 noted.  There is borderline upper zone redistribution, without other evidence
 of CHF.  Lateral view shows bilateral effusions with some underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.  
 
 Right IJ central line tip overlies the mid/lower right atrium, relatively low.
 No pneumothorax is identified. 
 
 Incidental note is made of truncation of the lateral right clavicle with
 well-corticated edge and the inferior edge of hardware in the cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in post-op appearance.  Small bilateral
 effusions.  No pneumothorax.
