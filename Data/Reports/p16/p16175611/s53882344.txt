                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  No definite focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia is seen. 
 Streaky opacities in the retrocardiac and right infrahilar region likely
 represent atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema is present. 
 Pleural effusions, if any, are small.  The heart size is top normal.  There is
 tortuosity of the aorta and calcification at the aortic root.  Cervical fusion
 hardware is partially imaged.  There is a chronic-appearing deformity of the
 right distal clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute abnormality.
 2.  Calcifications at the aortic root could indicate aortic stenosis in this
 patient with syncope.
