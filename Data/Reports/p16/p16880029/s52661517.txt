                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lower esophageal sphincter stricture, unable to tolerate oral
 intake.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  A
 patchy opacity is seen within the right lower lobe, and a retrocardiac opacity
 is also noted, findings concerning for aspiration.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated. 
 Evaluation of the lung apices is somewhat limited due to the patient's neck
 soft tissue projecting over and obscuring this region.  However, no large
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in
 the imaged thoracolumbar spine.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities concerning for aspiration.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
