 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is interval development of right
 hilar opacity, potentially representing lymphadenopathy.  There is also
 questionable of right peripheral opacities slightly more pronounced than on
 the prior study, findings that are concerning for potentially present
 lymphadenopathy and parenchymal findings and needs to be further assessed with
 chest CT.  Left mid upper lobe nodule, 8 mm, most likely seen on the previous

 Although no definitive evidence of pneumonia is seen, it cannot be excluded
 giving the limitations of the chest radiograph in would be another reason for
 assessment with chest CT.
