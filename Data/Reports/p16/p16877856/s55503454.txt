                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with EKG changes, fatigue  // Acute cardiopulmonary
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  Subtle increase in opacity over the
 right mid to lower lung more likely relates to overlying soft tissue rather
 than infection.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Relatively low lung volumes.  Subtle increase in opacity of the right mid to
 lower lung more likely relates to overlying soft tissue rather than infection.
 No definite focal consolidation.
