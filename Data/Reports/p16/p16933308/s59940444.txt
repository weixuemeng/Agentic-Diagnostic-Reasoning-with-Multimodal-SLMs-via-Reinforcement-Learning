                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hx of NSCLCA and endometrial CA tx from outside ED with
 finding of multiple intracranial mets, ataxia and N/V now intubated  //
 confirm ET placement     confirm ET placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to previous chest study dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 07:37 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.  Stable
 bandlike opacity in the right upper lobe likely related to the patient's
 history of lung cancer.  Interval appearance of a 1.3 cm peripheral nodular
 opacity in the right mid lung which would be concerning for metastasis or
 possibly new primary.  Heterogeneous appearance to the left fifth and sixth
 posterior ribs which may reflect superimposed external structures, but raise
 the possibility of bony metastasis.  This can be better assessed on followup
 imaging.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given
 differences in patient positioning.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
