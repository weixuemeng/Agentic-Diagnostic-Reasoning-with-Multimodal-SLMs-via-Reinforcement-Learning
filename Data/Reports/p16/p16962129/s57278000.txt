 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Nodular densities at the lung bases seen on a spine x-ray.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Spine x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The rounded dense
 structures seen on the spine x-ray are not visible on the current image.  Very
 likely those structures reflect vascular crossings.  The current image shows
 no evidence of pathological lung parenchymal changes.
