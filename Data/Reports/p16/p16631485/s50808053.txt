                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough with malaise, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are low in
 volume, giving the appearance of bronchovascular crowding without focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion. Right mid to lower lung opacity is most
 likely due summation of the shadows pulmonary vessels seen on prior studies
 and less likely to reflect pneumonia.  The heart is top normal in size with
 prominent left pulmonary artery and tortuous descending aorta.
