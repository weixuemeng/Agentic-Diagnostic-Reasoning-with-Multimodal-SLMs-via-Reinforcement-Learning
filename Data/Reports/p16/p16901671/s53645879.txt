                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with coronary artery
 disease, after CABG and mitral valve replacement with left back pain and
 suspected rib fracture.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The replaced aortic valve is re-demonstrated,
 unchanged in appearance.  Post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable.  Lungs are
 essentially clear with no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No definitive
 evidence of rib fracture or sternal wire fracture is demonstrated.  If
 clinically warranted, further assessment with rib series might be considered.
 
 The only area where potentially a rib fracture can be seen is along the
 lateral aspect of left fourth rib with new area of sclerosis demonstrated, not
 seen on the prior examination.
