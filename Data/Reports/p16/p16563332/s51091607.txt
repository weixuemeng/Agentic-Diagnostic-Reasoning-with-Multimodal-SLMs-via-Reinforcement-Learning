                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with parietal mass, rule out for pneumonia
 nodules or effusion.
 
 No comparison studies at this institution.  Please note that comparison to old
 films can be helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Lungs
 appear well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  There is a faint 6 mm nodular opacity projecting
 over the right ninth posterolateral rib.  Comparison to remote chest films
 would be advised to assess for stability.  In their absence, further imaging
 evaluation with CT may be helpful.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax. 
 No pulmonary edema.  No acute bony abnormality appreciated.  Mild degenerative
 changes in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine. 
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ by telephone on ___ at 8:47 p.m.
