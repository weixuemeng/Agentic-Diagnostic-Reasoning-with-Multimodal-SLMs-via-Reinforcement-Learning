                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent pneumonia. Resolution of pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 CT abdomen pelvis from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to prior radiograph, the lungs are hyperinflated.  There has been
 improvement of the left lower lobe opacity, and while residual or new
 pneumonia may be present, evaluation is difficult due to severe underlying
 bronchiectasis.  The right lower lobe opacity may have been present on prior
 exam.   Aortic stenosis is severe on prior CT.
 The heart size is top-normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  No
 pleural abnormality is seen.  Dual-chamber left-sided pacer is seen.  Aortic
 knob calcification is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Residual bilateral lower lobe opacities.  Acute changes affecting the area is
 difficult to evaluate due to severe chronic basal bronchiectasis.  Evaluation
 of resolution or residual bilateral basal cavitary pneumonia seen on prior CT
 abdomen pelvis can be followed up with dedicated chest CT.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 1. Residual left lower lobe opacities.
 2. Right lower lobe opacity, possibly from soft tissue artifact.
 3. Repeat exam with oblique views would be helpful.  Bilateral basal
 bronchiectasis or cavitary pneumonia seen on prior CT abdomen pelvis should be
 re-evaluated with dedicated chest CT.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The recommendation was entered by Dr. ___ on ___
 at 16:29 into the Department of Radiology critical communications system for
 direct communication to the referring provider.
