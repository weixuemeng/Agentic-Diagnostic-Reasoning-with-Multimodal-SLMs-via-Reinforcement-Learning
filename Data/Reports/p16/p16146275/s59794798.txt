                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is mild prominence of the
 contour associated with the left atrial appendage.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky opacity in the lingula suggests mild
 atelectasis or scarring.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Mild rightward
 convex curvature is centered along the mid thoracic spine.  The bones are
 possibly demineralized to some degree.  Degenerative changes are mild.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Mild prominence of left atrial
 appendage, which may suggest left atrial enlargement.  Streaky left lung
 opacities most consistent with minor scarring or atelectasis.
