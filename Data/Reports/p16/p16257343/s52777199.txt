 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 2.2 cm above the level of
 the carina.  Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm,
 coiling in the stomach.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen, although a trace right pleural effusion would
 be difficult to exclude.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate position.
