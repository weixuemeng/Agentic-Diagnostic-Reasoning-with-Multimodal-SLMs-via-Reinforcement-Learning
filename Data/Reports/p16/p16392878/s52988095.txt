                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cough.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are well
 expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  There
 is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or focal airspace
 consolidation.  Persistent tracheal narrowing is noted, with slight rightward
 deviation of the trachea, and right paratracheal thickening, unchanged
 compared to multiple prior studies, dating back to ___.  Right
 basilar bronchial wall thickening is likely due to underlying bronchiectasis
 or bronchitis, with a small amount of resulting atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Persistent tracheal narrowing with slight rightward deviation, possibly
 due to tracheomalacia or "saber-shaped" trachea due to underlyng chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Further evaluation for tracheomalacia could be
 obtained with inspiratory and expiratory chest CT.
