                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are normally expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, hilar contours and pleural surfaces are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate sagittal narrowing of the trachea
 is due to chronic lung disease and deviation rightward is due to the arch of
 the aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 2.  Moderate tracheal narrowing due to chronic lung disease; rightward likely
 secondary to impression by the arch of the aorta.
