 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hepatitis, recurrent fevers, evaluation for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, likely due to improved inspiration.  There currently is no evidence
 for the presence of parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.  No pleural
 effusions.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  The hilar and mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  Moderate scoliosis with asymmetry of the rib cage
 is again noted.
