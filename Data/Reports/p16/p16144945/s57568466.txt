                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with bilateral pulmonary effusions,
 now status post Lasix, assess effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting position using
 AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the single view
 chest examination obtained seven hours earlier during the same day.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly as before with configuration indicating left ventricular
 prominence.  Thoracic aorta unchanged.  The previously identified severe
 pulmonary congestive pattern with extensive interstitial and alveolar edema
 has markedly improved.  Aeration is now much better, and the pattern of
 central pulmonary edema has regressed.  There is still some interstitial edema
 present, and on the frontal view, mild degree of blunting of the lateral
 pleural sinuses is observed.  The lateral view discloses pleural effusion
 accumulating in the posterior pleural sinuses, but the amount is moderate.  No
 pneumothorax has developed.
 
 No new discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement of congestive pulmonary pattern and edema
 related to dehydration-Lasix therapy.
