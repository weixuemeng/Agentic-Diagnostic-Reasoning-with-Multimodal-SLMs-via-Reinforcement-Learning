                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chronic hypoxemia.  // Pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 CARDIOMEDIASTINAL CONTOURS ARE STABLE CONSIDERING LOWER LUNG VOLUMES COMPARED
 TO THE PRIOR STUDY. NEW, LINEAR BIBASILAR ATELECTASIS HAS DEVELOPED AS WELL AS
 A MORE PATCHY OPACITY PERIPHERALLY AT THE LEFT LUNG BASE. THIS COULD REFLECT
 FOCAL ATELECTASIS, ASPIRATION, OR AN EARLY FOCUS OF INFECTIOUS PNEUMONIA.
 SHORT-TERM FOLLOWUP RADIOGRAPHS MAY BE HELPFUL IN THIS REGARD
