                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Left upper lobe and left lower lobe wedge resection.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed three hours earlier.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Opacity
 in the left upper hemithorax and surgical clips are grossly unchanged from
 prior studies.  There is no pleural effusion.  There are low lung volumes. 
 Port-A-Cath is in standard position.  Right lung nodule is again noted. 
 Previously described opacity in the left mid lung is stable.  This could be
 atelectasis or pneumonia.  Continued followup is recommended.
