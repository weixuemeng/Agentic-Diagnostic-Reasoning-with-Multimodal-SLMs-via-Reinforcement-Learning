                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient status post left upper lobe and left lower lobe
 wedge resection for metastatic giant cell tumor, assess for hemothorax or
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is stable.  Widened mediastinum has
 improved.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Opacity in the
 left apex is grossly unchanged.  Surgical clips are noted in the left apex. 
 Retrocardiac opacities, likely atelectases, are unchanged.  Subcutaneous
 emphysema on the left has increased.  Left chest tube is in place.  Right
 Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position.  Multiple lung nodules and masses are
 better seen in prior CT.  Patient has known mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
