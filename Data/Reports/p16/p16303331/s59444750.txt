                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Male status post VATS with left upper lobe and left lower lobe
 wedge.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___; ___; ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right port tip is in mid-to-low SVC. Mild improvement in lung
 volumes bilaterally. Stable left upper lobe opacity from atelectasis and
 residual hemorrhage. Mild interval increase in left lower lobe opacity. 
 Stable bibasilar atelectasis and right lung mass.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Heart size, mediastinal contours and hilar are normal.  No bony

 IMPRESSION:  Mild interval increase in left lower lobe opacity likely residual
 hemorrhage and atelectasis; however, in the appropriate clinical setting may
 represent pneumonia. Consider continued followup.
