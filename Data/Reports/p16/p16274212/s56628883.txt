 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is increasing
 opacification in the right mid lung as well as in the left perihilar region
 and mid lung, all consistent with developing pneumonia.  The cardiac
 silhouette is essentially unchanged.  There is opacification at the bases
 consistent with small pleural effusions and atelectatic changes.
 Dobhoff tube again coils on itself so that the opaque tip is in the upper
 stomach pointing toward the esophagogastric junction.
