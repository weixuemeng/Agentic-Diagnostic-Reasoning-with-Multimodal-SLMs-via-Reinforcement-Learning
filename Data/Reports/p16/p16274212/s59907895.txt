 INDICATION:  ___F with h/o lupus, on steroids, p/w headache and found to have
 IPH and IVH  // dobhoff tube - interval change.      dobhoff tube - interval
 change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the Dobhoff tube, which extends to the distal stomach.  The
 endotracheal tube appears to have been removed.  Right PICC line is unchanged.
 There are lower lung volumes with increased retrocardiac opacification
 obscuration of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with worsening volume loss in the
 left lower lobe and pleural he fusion.  The opacification in the right mid
 zone is decreasing, as is the mid zone opacification on the opposite side.
