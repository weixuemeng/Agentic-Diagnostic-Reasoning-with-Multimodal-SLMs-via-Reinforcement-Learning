                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Relatively low lung volumes may account for
 much of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 
 Prominence of the hilar regions may be a manifestation of the low lung
 volumes.
