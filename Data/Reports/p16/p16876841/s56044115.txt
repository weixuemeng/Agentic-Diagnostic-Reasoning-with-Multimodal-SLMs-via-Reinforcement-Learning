                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are bilateral parenchymal opacities at the bases medially as
 well as in the right mid lung.  Enlargement of the right hilum may be due to
 adjacent/overlying parenchymal consolidation, although adenopathy is also
 possible. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.  Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggest
 prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar right mid lung opacities compatible with pneumonia in
 the proper clinical setting.  Prominent right hilum.  Recommend repeat after
 treatment is suggested to document resolution of these findings.  
 
 Patient was discharged from ED with diagnosis of pneumonia.
