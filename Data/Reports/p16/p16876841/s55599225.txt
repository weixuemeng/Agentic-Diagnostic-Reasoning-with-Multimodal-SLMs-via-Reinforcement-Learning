 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent pneumonia, evaluation for resolution.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the known right lung
 pneumonia has almost completely resolved.  The only parenchymal remnants seen
 are extremely subtle and small.  The lung volumes continue to be low, with
 mild atelectasis at both lung bases.  No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary
 edema.
