                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with abdominal pain and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear.  There is stable moderate cardiomegaly.  There is
 rightward tracheal deviation, more prominent when compared to prior studies.
 There is no pneumothorax. There is no pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascularity
 is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Left paratracheal density with rightward tracheal deviation, more prominent
 than on prior studies.  This could be due to enlarged thyroid, although none
 was seen on prior thyroid ultrasound, or other soft tissue.  This could be
 further evaluated with outpatient thyroid ultrasound or CT.
