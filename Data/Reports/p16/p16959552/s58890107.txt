 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with HFpEF, new onset afib, s/p cardioversion,
 now w/ new O2 requirement, admitted for diuresis.  // CHF exacerbation - fluid
 overload?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous left lower lobe consolidation has resolved. Moderate cardiomegaly is
 chronic. Pulmonary vascular congestion has not improved.  I doubt there is
 pulmonary edema.
 
 In the setting of pulmonary vascular engorgement it is impossible to exclude
 small lung nodules. If disseminated malignancy is a viable diagnosis, chest CT
 scanning would be required.
