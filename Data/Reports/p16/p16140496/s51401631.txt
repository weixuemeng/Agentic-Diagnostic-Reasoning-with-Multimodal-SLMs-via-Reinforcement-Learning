                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.  Slight bibasilar
 opacities likely relate to atelectasis, although an evolving consolidation is
 not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The aorta is calcified.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal.  Old right posterior lateral fifth rib fracture is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities likely representing
 atelectasis.  Evolving consolidation not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
