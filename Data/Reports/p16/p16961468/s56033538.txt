 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with a history of lung cancer status post EBUS
 who presents for evaluation of interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There appears to be a spiculated mass in the left upper lobe which
 corresponds to the patient's malignancy on the prior chest CT.  There also
 appears to be bilateral hilar fullness, secondary to lymphadenopathy, also
 seen on the previous chest CT.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or
 pleural effusions. The heart size is stable. The visualized osseous structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No evidence of a pneumothorax.
 
 2. Spiculated mass in the left upper lung, which likely corresponds to
 patient's known malignancy from prior CT.
 
 3. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
