                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with L rib fractures  // interval change     
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  There no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lungs are well expanded and clear. Heart size is top- normal. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fracture is visible.
 
 The Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen,
 conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or
 characterization of such abnormalities. If the demonstration of a fracture or
 other trauma is clinically warranted, the location of any focal findings
 should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT
 scanning.
