                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old previously healthy male with night sweats, cough, and
 newly diagnosed vasculitis of celiac artery  // evaluate for infiltrate,
 nodules
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung volumes are normal.  Minimal enlargement of the left hilus, with
 hilifugal string-like interstitial opacities radiating into the left upper
 lobe.  Given the absence of comparison radiographs and clinical presentation
 of the patient, computed tomography should be considered to further evaluate
 these changes and to exclude a chronic inflammatory process.
 
 No other abnormalities are noted.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette
 without pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.
