                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:   History: ___F with AMS  // r/o PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  SINGLE, AP, PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is present. There is no evidence of focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema. A
 right hilar opacity is likely exaggerated secondary to patient rotation and
 overlap with the mediastinum. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
 The descending thoracic aorta is noted to be somewhat tortuous.  A chronic,
 left humeral fracture is incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
