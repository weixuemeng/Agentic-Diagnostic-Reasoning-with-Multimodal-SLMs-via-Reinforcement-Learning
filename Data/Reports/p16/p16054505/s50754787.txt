 Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal brachiocephalic
 near the junction with the SVC. A right internal jugular large bore catheter
 unchanged in position.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours remain stably
 enlarged.  Lung volumes are diminished. Interval improvement in mild pulmonary
 edema. No large effusions. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Patchy opacity at
 the right medial lung base likely reflects atelectasis, although superimposed
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
