                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Recent acute renal failure requiring dialysis now presenting with
 dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mild to moderately enlarged. Again noted is moderate relative
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Each hilum shows substantial congestive
 changes with fullness and indistinctness of vessels including peribronchial
 cuffing.  Upper zone vascular redistribution is noted as well as a moderate
 interstitial abnormality.  More confluent streaky opacities at the lung bases
 can probably be is attributed to atelectasis. Fissures are thickened.  Small
 pleural effusions are suspected but not well demonstrated.
