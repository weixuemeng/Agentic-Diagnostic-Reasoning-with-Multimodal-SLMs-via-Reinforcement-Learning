 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has developed a

 ___, was contacted by telephone and the findings were subsequently
 discussed.  Otherwise, there is no relevant change.  Constant mild
 cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta but without pulmonary
 edema.  No pleural effusions.  Unchanged mild mediastinal widening,
 potentially caused by a retrosternal goiter.
