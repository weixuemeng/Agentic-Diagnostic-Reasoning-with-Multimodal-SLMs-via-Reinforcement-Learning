                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine chest radiograph shows stable enteric, endotracheal
 tubes, and left subclavian central venous catheter.  The heart size is top
 normal and stable.  Left pleural effusion is new, and right lung base
 parenchymal opacity has increased, although may be a function of decreased
 lung volumes. Degree of pulmonary edema is slightly better. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in lung volumes with apparent increase in
 opacity at the right lung base, and new left pleural effusion. Improvement in
 pulmonary edema, slightly.
