 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Palpitations, cardiomegaly.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal.
 There is minimal fluid marking of the pulmonary fissures, borderline diameter
 azygous vein and a slight increase in diameter of the pulmonary vessels. 
 Overall, these findings might suggest mild fluid overload.  This is supported
 by the borderline size of the heart.  No pleural effusions.  Minimal
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Focal parenchymal opacities suggesting
 pneumonia.
