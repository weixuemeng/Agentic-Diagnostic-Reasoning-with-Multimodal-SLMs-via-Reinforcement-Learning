                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain, evaluate for free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are
 unchanged, with the heart size within normal limits.  There are low lung
 volumes.  This causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax, with mild atelectatic
 changes noted at the lung bases.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.  No
 definite free air is seen under the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No free air noted under the diaphragms.  Low lung volumes with
 mild bibasilar atelectasis.
