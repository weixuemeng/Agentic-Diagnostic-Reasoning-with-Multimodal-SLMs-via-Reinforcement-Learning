                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy with pneumothorax, status
 post line exchange, need to assess for pneumo, status post line removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed the same day two
 hours earlier and ___, chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube, which is
 coiled within the pharynx.  There is a left-sided PICC line with tip
 terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  There is interval removal of the
 right-sided central venous sheath.  No pneumothorax evident.  There is stable
 small right pleural effusion.  Right lower lung opacification likely
 represents combination of atelectasis and layering pleural effusion.  Stable
 calcified granuloma projects over right mid lung.  A nodular opacity
 projecting over left upper lung corresponds with nipple evident on the
 ___, chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobbhoff tube coiled in esophagus with tip in pharynx.  Recommend
 withdrawal.
 2.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 3.  Stable right pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis.
