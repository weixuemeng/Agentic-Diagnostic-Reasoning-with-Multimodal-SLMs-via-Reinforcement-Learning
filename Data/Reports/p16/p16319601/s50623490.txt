                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Bilateral chest tubes removed.  Assess for pneumothorax or
 increasing pleural effusions.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There is no evident pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  There are low lung volumes.  Left
 PICC tip is in the mid SVC.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Bibasilar
 atelectases,  larger on the right side, are stable.  Calcified granulomas in
 the right upper lobe are again noted.  Ill-defined rounded opacity in the left
 upper lobe is persistent.  When clinically feasible CT is recommended for
 further evaluation.
