  Previously seen small right pneumothorax is not well visualized on the present
  study.  A moderate to large layering right pleural effusion persists, possibly
  slightly larger.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left pigtail and right pneumothorax, to assess for changes.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the apparent
 small pneumothorax tracking along the minor fissure is not definitely
 appreciated.  There is hazy opacification of the right hemithorax with poor
 definition of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with layering pleural effusion and
 compressive atelectasis at the base.  Mild atelectatic changes are also seen
 on the left.
 
 The nasogastric tube has been removed.  Right IJ catheter and left subclavian
 catheter remain in place.
