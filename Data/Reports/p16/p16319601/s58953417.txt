 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with deep vein thrombosis, IVC filter,
 on Argatroban, status post colonic perforation - total colectomy from UC,
 concern for aspiration now.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in sitting
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 portable chest examination of ___.  Previously identified
 right-sided PICC line remains in unchanged position.  On frontal view, lungs
 are clear.  No evidence of new pulmonary infiltrates can be established. 
 Noticed is a barium meal that has passed through the esophagus and now
 visualized in the stomach, as well the proximal small bowel.  These findings
 are rather unremarkable on this single chest view examination.
