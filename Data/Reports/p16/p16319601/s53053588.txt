                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left pigtail catheter.  Concern for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 A right IJ and left PICC are unchanged in position.  An NGT terminates within
 the stomach. The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged since the 1:02 p.m. examination.  Again seen is a lucency across the
 right minor fissure, representing a small pneumothorax, unchanged in
 appearance since the prior study.  However, there has been an interval
 increase of a moderate-sized right pleural effusion.  The left lung remains
 clear.  A pigtail catheter is positioned at the left lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged small right pneumothorax tracking along the minor fissure.
 2.  Interval increase of a moderate-sized right pleural effusion since the
 1:02 p.m. study.
 3.  No left pneumothorax.
