                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left-sided abdominal pain and confusion.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again there is mild hyperinflation, likely due to emphysema.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. 
 Kyphosis of the thoracic spine is unchanged.  Mild loss of height in multiple
 vertebral bodies appears grossly similar to the prior radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
