                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever  // Eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  The mediastinal contours
 are unremarkable.  There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution suggestive
 of mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema.  Streaky
 bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect areas of atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are
 moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion and streaky bibasilar airspace
 opacities, likely atelectasis.
