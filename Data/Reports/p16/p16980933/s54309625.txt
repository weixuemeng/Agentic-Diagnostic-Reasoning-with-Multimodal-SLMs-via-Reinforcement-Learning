                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and dyspnea after heavy lifting.  Also with left
 posterior rib pain.  Assess for acute intrathoracic process and/or fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The
 lungs are clear.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Discontinuity of the cortex along the posterior aspect of the left seventh rib
 is consistent with a minimally displaced fracture. Subtle irregularity of the
 posterior 8th rib may represent a non-displaced fracture. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Minimally displaced fracture involving the posterior arch of the left
 seventh rib, and possibly also the left posterior 8th rib.   
 
 2.  No pneumothorax.
