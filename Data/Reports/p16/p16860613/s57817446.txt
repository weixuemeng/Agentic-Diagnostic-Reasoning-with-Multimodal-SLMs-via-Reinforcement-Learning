                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New PICC line.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed.
 
 The right PICC line tip appears to be in the right atrium and should be pulled
 back approximately 3.5 cm to secure its position in low SVC.  The patient is
 after aortic valve replacement.  Pleural effusions are bilateral, left more
 than right, better appreciated on the lateral view.
