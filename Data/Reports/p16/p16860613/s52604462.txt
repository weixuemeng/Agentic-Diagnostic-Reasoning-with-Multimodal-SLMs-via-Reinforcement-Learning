                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Low-grade fever with leukocytosis and cough.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ and CT abdomen from ___.
 
 There is interval development of left pleural effusion (suspected but
 difficult to establish due to overlying substantial left rectal sheath
 hematoma.  The other possibility is that the hematoma continues to expand. 
 Lateral view would be helpful to distinguish between the projection of the
 hematoma and the pleural effusion.  Consolidation in the left lower lung is
 another possibility.  The right lung is clear and there is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Expanding hematoma versus pleural effusion and consolidation in
 the left lower lobe.  Given the normal appearance of the chest radiograph on
 ___ in the presence of large hematoma at that point, left lower lobe
 pneumonia and pleural effusion would be more likely.
