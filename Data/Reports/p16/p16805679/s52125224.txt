 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest, back pain, questionable rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no compelling evidence of rib fractures.  However, if the
 clinical symptoms persist without other explanation, a dedicated rib series,
 focused on the site of the pain, could be performed.
 
 Normal appearance of the lung parenchyma.  Normal appearance of the cardiac
 silhouette and of the hilar and mediastinal contours.  No pneumothorax, no
 pneumonia, no direct or indirect signs for PE.
