                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, sputum production, shortness of breath, and syncope today.
 Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia versus pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, causing accentuation of the
 bronchovasculature.  There is mild bilateral lower lung atelectasis.  There is
 no focal consolidation.  The heart is normal in size.  The thoracic aorta is
 mildly tortuous throughout its course.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Note is made of gaseous distention of the esophagus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Low lung volumes with basilar opacities likely due to atelectasis.
 
 2.  Mild gaseous distention of the thoracic esophagus.
