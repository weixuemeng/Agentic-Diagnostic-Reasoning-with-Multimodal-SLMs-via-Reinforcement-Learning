                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Unsteady gait and headache.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Mild unfolding is noted along the
 thoracic aorta.  Allowing for differences in technique, with lower lung
 volumes on this study, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  Streaky right mid lung opacity suggests minor atelectasis or
 scarring.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the mid thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
