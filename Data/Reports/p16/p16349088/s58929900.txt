                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Severe upper back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar
 and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax,
 focal consolidation, or pleural effusion.  No osseous lesions are detected,
 although the sensitivity for spinal lesions is limited with this technique.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.  If there remains a high clinical
 concern for thoracic spinal metastases, MRI can be considered.
