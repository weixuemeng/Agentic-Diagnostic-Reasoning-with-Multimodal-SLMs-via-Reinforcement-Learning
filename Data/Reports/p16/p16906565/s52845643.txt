 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multiple myeloma, chest wall plasmacytoma.
 Now with increased work of breathing, dropping Hct.  // Eval for hemothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, bilateral alveolar
 opacities have developed predominantly in the perihilar regions.  Distribution
 favors pulmonary edema, but pulmonary hemorrhage is an important consideration
 in this setting of a dropping hematocrit.  Small to moderate right pleural
 effusion is new.  Widespread skeletal abnormalities related to history of
 myeloma are unchanged.
