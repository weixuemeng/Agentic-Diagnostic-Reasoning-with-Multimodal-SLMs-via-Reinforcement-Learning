                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and tachycardia with low grade fever  //
 ?pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 13:11, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the
 junction of the SVC and right atrium.  Mild cardiomegaly persists with a left
 ventricular predominance.  The mediastinal contour is slightly unfolded. 
 Hilar contours are unchanged.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is
 present without overt pulmonary edema.  Myelomatous osseous lesions involving
 the ribs bilaterally as well as the thoracic spine appear grossly unchanged
 from the recent radiograph, and better assessed on the previous CT.  No new
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Cervical
 thoracic spinal fusion hardware is incompletely assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Grossly
 unchanged appearance of multiple myeloma lesions in the chest.
