 Again seen is spinal fusion hardware, right-sided Port-A-Cath with tip
 terminating in the mid to distal SVC, and postsurgical ___ overlying the
 mediastinum.  The mediastinum is largely obscured by hardware.  Partially
 visualized heart appears unchanged in size.  Lung volumes are low.  Pleural
 based mass at the level of the right mid lung as well as extensive bony
 lesions better appreciated on most recent CT of the chest.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

 The mediastinum and lungs are largely obscured by hardware.  Within these
