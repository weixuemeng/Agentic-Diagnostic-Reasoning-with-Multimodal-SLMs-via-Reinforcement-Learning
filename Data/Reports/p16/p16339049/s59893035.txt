                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and end-stage renal disease.  Evaluate pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The lung volumes are lower.  Mild pulmonary edema with moderate
 cardiomegaly is noted.  There may be a small right pleural effusion which
 demonstrates loculation laterally and a small left pleural effusion.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Accounting for differences in technique, the mediastinum is
 unchanged.  Linear areas of scarring are seen in the left mid lung.  The most
 inferior sternotomy wire is fractured.
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema with low lung volumes.
