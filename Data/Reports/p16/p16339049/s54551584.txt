 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy CABG.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  Dual lumen right-sided central venous catheter tip terminates in
 the proximal right atrium, unchanged.  Loculated small right pleural effusion
 is unchanged compared the prior study induced chronic.  Curvilinear opacities
 are noted bilaterally which are unchanged, compatible with rounded
 atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion is also stable.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.  Clips are noted within the right upper quadrant
 the abdomen compatible with prior cholecystectomy.

 No significant interval change from the prior study.  Continued small
 bilateral pleural effusions with the right pleural effusion demonstrating
 lateral loculation.  Unchanged rounded atelectasis bilaterally.
