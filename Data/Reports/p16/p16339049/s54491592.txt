                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___; CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  A
 dialysis catheter again terminates in the upper atrium.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There are
 similar patchy linear opacities in the left mid lung as well as right lung
 opacities with a moderate pleural effusion in the right costophrenic angle
 that may be loculated to some degree.  A posterior wedge-like opacity is
 nonspecific but suggests additional loculated fluid as a likely etiology or
 round atelectasis.  This opacity seems to correspond to perhaps increased
 fluid associated with left lower lobe atelectasis or scarring seen on the
 prior CT.  Comparing the right-sided pleural effusion directly to the most
 recent prior study, there has been no definite change allowing for differences
 in technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essentially stable appearance of the chest including moderate
 right-sided pleural effusion with suspected loculation and associated opacity,
 probably compatible with atelectasis.
