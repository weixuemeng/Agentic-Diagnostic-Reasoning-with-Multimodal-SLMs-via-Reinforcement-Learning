                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever, generalized body aches.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.  ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 is re- demonstrated.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Previously noted central venous catheter has been removed.  No pulmonary
 vascular congestion is noted.  Small right pleural effusion is chronic, and
 demonstrates lateral loculation.  Curvilinear opacities in the left mid lung
 field laterally as well as in the right lung base likely reflect rounded
 atelectasis and/or scarring.  No new areas of focal consolidation are present,
 and there is no pneumothorax.  Trace left pleural effusion is similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change in small bilateral pleural effusions with the
 right pleural effusion again demonstrated a component which is loculated
 laterally.  Unchanged areas of rounded atelectasis and/or scarring within both
 lungs.
