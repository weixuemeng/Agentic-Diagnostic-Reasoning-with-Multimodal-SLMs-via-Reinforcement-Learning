                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left rib pain.  Evaluate for rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate interval
 resolution of right lower lobe opacities.  The lung volumes are slightly
 decreased compared to the prior study, accentuating the cardiac contour and
 pulmonary vasculature.  Otherwise, the cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated.  No rib
 fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval resolution of right basilar opacity with no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.  No rib fracture is identified.  Consider dedicated
 rib series with radiopaque BB at the site of pain if clinical concern
 persists.
