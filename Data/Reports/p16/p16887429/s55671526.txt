                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic prostate cancer, to assess for pulmonary lesions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. 
 Again there is a large hiatal hernia.  No acute focal pneumonia or vascular
 congestion.
 
 No definite metastases identified.  However, there is the vague suggestion of
 opacification overlying the most posterior portion of the left fifth rib just
 above the level of the aortic arch.  An apical lordotic view could be
 considered to determine whether this represents a true finding.  At the same
 time, repeat PA view could be helpful to see whether this appearance merely
 reflects a fortuitous overlap of shadows.
 
 Of incidental note are calcifications in the region of the carotid
 bifurcations bilaterally.
