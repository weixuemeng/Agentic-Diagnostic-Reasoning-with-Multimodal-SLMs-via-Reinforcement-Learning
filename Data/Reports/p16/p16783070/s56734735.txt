                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxia, history of lung cancer, dyspnea, assess cause.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.  Given lack of
 prior studies for comparison, evaluation is quite limited.  There is a
 hyperinflated right lung suggesting underlying emphysema.  Trace right pleural
 effusion and right basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.  There is a double
 density obscuring the left mid and lower lung which could represent left
 pleural effusion, basilar consolidation, likely also a component of
 atelectasis. No pneumothorax.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  Also,
 mediastinal contour is impossible to assess given the adjacent opacity in the
 left hemithorax.  The bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam given no prior studies for comparison with large
 opacity obscuring the majority of the left lung which could be secondary to
 effusion and consolidation.  Right effusion and basilar atelectasis with
 probable background emphysema.
