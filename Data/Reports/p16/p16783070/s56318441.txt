 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with oxygen requirement and known
 pulmonary carcinoma with effusions.  Evaluate for progression of disease.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is unchanged and within
 normal limits.  No pulmonary congestion is present.  As before, there exist
 bilateral pleural effusion blunting the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses.
 The amount of pleural effusions has increased slightly, but is still not of
 large quantity.  The area of the left hilar infiltrate has increased mildly
 and shows sharp delineation in comparison with the previous study.  No other
 new abnormalities are present.  As before, marked kyphotic curvature increase
 in the thoracic spine is noted with diffusely demineralized vertebral bodies,
 several of which have an anterior wedge compressed appearance.  These findings
 are, however, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided perihilar density apparently representing lung cancer.
 Bilateral pleural effusion with mild degree of increment since the next
