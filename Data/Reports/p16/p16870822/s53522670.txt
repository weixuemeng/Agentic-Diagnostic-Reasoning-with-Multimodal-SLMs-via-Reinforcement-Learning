                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with three weeks of fatigue and productive cough
 with altered mental status for two days.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  The lungs are clear of consolidation.  Again, there are
 trace bilateral effusions.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Oblong lucent structure at and below the carina, likely due to
 slightly dilated air-filled esophagus.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 otherwise notable for atherosclerotic calcifications at the arch.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are unchanged, noting mild compression deformities of
 the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
