                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Question widened mediastinum on AP film.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  The appearance of the
 mediastinum is unchanged with minimally distended SVC.  There is a small right
 pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of pneumonia.  Minimal reticular
 bibasilar opacities likely represent minimal interstitial edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
