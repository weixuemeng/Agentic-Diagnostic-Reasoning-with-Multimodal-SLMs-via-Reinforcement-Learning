  1. R PICC tip in lower SVC.
  2. bibasilar haziness may represent low volumes plus breast shadow rather than
  developing pneumonia.
  3. pulmonary congestion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute onset, shortness of breath, back pain, evaluation for acute
 pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 right-sided PICC line.  The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the
 line projects over the mid-to-low SVC.  There is no evidence of complications,
 no pneumothorax.
 
 In the interval, the cardiac silhouette has minimally increased and there are
 mild areas of retrocardiac atelectasis.  Also is a very mild increase in
 density at both lung bases, potentially suggesting the presence of minimal
 pleural effusions.  No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
