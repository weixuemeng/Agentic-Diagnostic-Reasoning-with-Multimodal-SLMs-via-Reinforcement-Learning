                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is unfolding of the thoracic
 aorta.  The right central and upper mediastinal contours appears widened,
 suspected to reflect perhaps distention of the superior vena cava, but not
 entirely specific.  The lungs appear clear.  There is new mild elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm compared to the prior study.  Posterior costophrenic
 sulci appear blunted, so small effusions could be considered, particularly on
 the left, but not definitive.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild loss among mid
 thoracic vertebral body heights appears stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspected subpulmonic effusion on the left.  New apparent
 widening of the right mediastinum, possibly distention of the superior vena
 cava and perhaps primarily related to AP technique.  When clinically
 appropriate, evaluation with standard PA and lateral radiographs is
 recommended to see whether widening may persist and need further evaluation. 
 Recommendation discussed with Dr. ___ at 10:30 pm on the same day by
 telephone.
