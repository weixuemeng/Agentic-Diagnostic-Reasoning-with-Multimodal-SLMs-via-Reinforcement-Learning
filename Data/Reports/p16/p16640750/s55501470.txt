 As compared to the previous image, the lung volumes remain very low.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.  Status post vertebroplasty. Large
 hiatal hernia.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumonia.  There is no evidence of
 an abnormal contour at the level of the right hilus on today's examination.

 given the superior sensitivity of this technique.
