 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, chronic heart failure, evaluation for pneumonia or
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:11 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a decrease in lung

 increased.  This could be an indication for mild pulmonary edema.  Unchanged
 moderate cardiomegaly.  No pleural effusions.  No evidence of pneumonia.
