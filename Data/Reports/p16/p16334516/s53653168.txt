                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ET tube and central venous line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier today, ___ at 10:56.
 
 FINDINGS:  Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm,
 coiling in the stomach.  There has been interval placement of an endotracheal
 tube, terminating approximately 3 cm above the level of the carina.  A
 left-sided internal jugular central venous catheter has also been placed in
 the interval, terminating in the proximal SVC.  There has been interval
 development of left lower lobe atelectasis with possible effusion.  There is
 also increase in perihilar opacity suggesting pulmonary edema.  Scattered
 areas of linear opacity again seen due to scarring/atelectasis.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  Again, the patient is status
 post median sternotomy and CABG.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal and enteric tubes in appropriate position.
 2.  Interval placement of a left-sided IJ central venous catheter terminating
 in the proximal SVC without evidence of pneumothorax.
 3.  Interval development of left base opacity, likely combination of left
 lower lobe collapse and pleural effusion.  Increased perihilar opacities
 suggest pulmonary edema.
