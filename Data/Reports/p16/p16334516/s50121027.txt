                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with renal transplant and heart disease, now
 with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate improved atelectasis in
 the right upper lung and left lower lung from previous imaging.  A hazy
 opacity over the left lung base suggests a layering pleural effusion.  A small
 area of hazy opacity at the right costophrenic angle may represent a small
 layering pleural effusion.  Bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion is again
 seen, essentially unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in atelectasis.  Persistent vascular
 congestion and bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
