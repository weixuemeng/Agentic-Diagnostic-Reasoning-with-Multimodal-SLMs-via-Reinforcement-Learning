                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:42 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with urosepsis and respiratory failure.  Check ET
 tube position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 3:43 p.m.:
 
 Endotracheal tube has been withdrawn, tip now approximately 2.5 cm above the
 carina with the chin in neutral position.  It could be withdrawn another 15 mm
 to avoid inadvertent unilateral intubation when the chin and neck are in
 flexion:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema is continuing to improve, and previous left pleural
 effusion has virtually resolved.  Heart size normal.  Upper enteric drainage
 tube ends in the upper portion of a non-distended stomach but would need to be
 advanced at least 6 cm to move all the side ports beyond the GE junction. 
 Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size normal.
