                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with new right IJ line.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous film from
 earlier the same day at 12:59.  New right IJ line is seen with tip projecting
 over the mid SVC.  There is no visualized pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube is
 approximately 1.5 cm from the carina and should be withdrawn several
 centimeters for optimal positioning.  Enteric tube is also slightly withdrawn
 with side port just proximal to the GE junction and should be advanced.  Right
 mid lung surgical chain sutures again seen.  Streaky right mid lung and left
 lung base opacities may be due to atelectasis.  Fullness of the soft tissues
 in the right hilar region are seen, the etiology of which is uncertain.  Given
 prior surgery there could be scarring or post-treatment changes, although
 underlying mass is possible, and dedicated imaging should be performed when
 patient is amenable.  Mediastinal clips with median sternotomy wires again
 noted.  Filter projecting over the IVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right IJ line with tip projecting over the mid SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube tip 1.5 cm from the carina and should be
 withdrawn for optimal positioning.  NG tube side port proximal to the GE
 junction and should be advanced for optimal positioning.
