                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with endotracheal tube, status post transfer.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube is seen with
 tip within 1 cm of the carina and should be withdrawn.  Enteric tube is seen
 with tip at the gastric fundus, side port likely just beyond the GE junction. 
 Low lung volumes are seen.  Surgical chain sutures project over the right mid
 lung with associated linear opacity, potentially atelectasis.  Increased
 opacity at the right perihilar region.  Median sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal clips are identified.  Linear opacity at the left lung base may
 represent atelectasis.  The bones are diffusely osteopenic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube within 1 cm of the carina and should be
 withdrawn.  Right mid lung surgical chain sutures with associated linear
 opacity, potentially atelectasis or scarring.  Increased density in the right
 hilar region, for which dedicated PA and lateral suggested when patient is
 amenable.  
 
 Additional film had been taken at the time of this dictation.
