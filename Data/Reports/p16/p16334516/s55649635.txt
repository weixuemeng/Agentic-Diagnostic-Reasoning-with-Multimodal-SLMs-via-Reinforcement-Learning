 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two semi-upright views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There are hazy bibasilar opacities suggestive of layering
 effusions.  Linear opacity in the right mid lung abutting surgical chain
 sutures are seen, potentially scarring or contribution from fluid within the
 fissure.  Linear opacity in the left mid to lower lung is again seen
 suggestive of scarring or atelectasis.  There is cephalization of the
 vasculature and prominence of the azygos vein.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are also unchanged.  IVC
 filter is seen within the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Post-surgical changes seen in the right lung.
