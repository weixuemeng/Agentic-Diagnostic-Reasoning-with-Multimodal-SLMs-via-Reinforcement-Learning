                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CT-guided aspiration of periaortic fluid collection,
 question pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 There is a possible tiny left-sided apical pneumothorax.  No other findings
 suggestive of pneumothorax are identified.  There is only minimal blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle, without other pleural fluid.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged compared with ___ at
 4:23 a.m.  The pulmonary parenchymal opacities in the left lung are similar,
 possibly very slightly improved.  Opacity at the right base is noted, new
 compared with the earlier film, question atelectasis.  
 
 ET tube 4.9 cm above the carina.  NG tube with radiopaque tip overlying
 fundus.  Left subclavian central line with tip over proximal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ? tiny left apical pneumothorax.
