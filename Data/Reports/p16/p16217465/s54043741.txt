 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Smoking history, evaluation for lung lesions.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild scoliosis with subsequent asymmetry of the rib cage.  Normal
 lung volumes.  No diaphragmatic flattening.  At the medial aspect of the right
 cardiophrenic angle there is a zone of indistinct increased opacity, without a
 correlate on the lateral image.  No other lung parenchymal abnormalities. 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable zone of increased density at the right medial lung
 bases.  Given the clinical history and a subsequent increased risk the finding
 should be confirmed or excluded using CT.
