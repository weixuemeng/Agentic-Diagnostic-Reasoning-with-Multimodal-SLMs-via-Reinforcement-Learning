 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess ET tube.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior exam seven hours before. 
 
 ET tube tip is 1.2 cm above the carina.  Given the fact that the patient's
 chin is down, it is in appropriate position.  There has been interval increase
 in moderate-to-large right pleural effusion.  There are no other interval
 changes.
