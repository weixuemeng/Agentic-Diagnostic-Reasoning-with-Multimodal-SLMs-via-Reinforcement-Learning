                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of intubation.  Please evaluate ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs performed on ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube is low-lying, measuring approximately 1.6 cm above the
 carina.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, with mild pulmoanry edema. Otherwise, the hilar and mediastinal
 contours are normal.  Consolidations overlying the mid-to-lower right lung
 likely secondary to pneumonia. Enteric tube extends below the diaphragm with
 the tip in the body of the stomach. There is no evidence of pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube is low-lying, measuring approximately 1.6 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  Opacities overlying the mid to lower right lung is likely secondary to
 pneumonia.
 
 3.  Mild pulmonary edema.
