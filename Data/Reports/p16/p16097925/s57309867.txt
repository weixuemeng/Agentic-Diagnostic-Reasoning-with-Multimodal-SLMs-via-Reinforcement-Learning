                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with variceal bleed intubated  // confirm tube
 and line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.2 cm above the carina, with the
 head down. Right IJ catheter tip is likely in the mid SVC, unchanged. Right
 PICC tip has been withdrawn and is now likely at the cavoatrial junction. Lung
 volumes remain extremely low.  Dense bibasilar opacities are unchanged and
 could be due to atelectasis/effusions or consolidation. Mild pulmonary edema.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Appropriate placement of lines and tubes.
 2. Persistent extremely low lung volumes and dense bibasilar opacities, likely
 a combination of pneumonia and atelectasis
