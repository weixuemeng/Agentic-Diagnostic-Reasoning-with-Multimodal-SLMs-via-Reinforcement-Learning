                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with gastric bleed s/p masive resuscitation and
 intubated // eval interval change in pulmonary edema and confirm tube and line
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. Diffuse bilateral airspace
 opacities are consistent with aspiration of blood in the setting of massive
 upper GI bleed. Moderate size right pleural effusion with bibasilar
 atelectasis is grossly unchanged. The cardiomediastinal hilar contours are
 unchanged. Monitoring and support devices are in the appropriate positions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities are consistent with aspiration in the
 setting of massive upper GI bleed.
 
 2. Monitoring and support devices are in the appropriate positions.
