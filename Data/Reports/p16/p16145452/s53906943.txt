                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post wedge resection.  Evaluate interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The right apical pneumothorax has since resolved.  Surgical sutures
 are seen within the right mid lung.
 
 Predominantly basilar, reticular interstitial opacification are unchanged,
 consistent with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Increased opacities are seen at
 the left lung base. There is no pleural effusion.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours, including mild cardiomegaly, are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Resolution of the right apical pneumothorax. Baseline changes of
 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with a superimposed opacity at the left lung
 base which may reflect atelectasis acute on chronic inflammation, or in the
 correct clinical setting, infection.
