                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with interstitial pulmonary
 fibrosis and pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside study (chest CT obtained in ___).
 
 The previous study demonstrates the presence of pneumomediastinum with no
 substantial pneumothorax present.  The current chest radiograph redemonstrates
 small amount of pneumomediastinum with no definitive evidence of pneumothorax,
 corresponding to the prior imaging.  Extensive involvement of the lungs by
 interstitial fibrosis as well as low lung volumes is noted.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unremarkable in appearance.  Elevated right hemidiaphragm is
 noted, chronicity unknown.
