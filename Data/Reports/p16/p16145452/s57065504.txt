                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after VATS and chest tube
 air leak.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to prior
 study obtained on ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Bibasal atelectasis have
 substantially progressed in the interim, in particular in the right lower lobe
 where there is currently evidence of atelectasis potentially of the entire
 lobe as well as apical pneumothorax.  No subcutaneous air is demonstrated.  No
 interval development of new consolidations besides the right lower lobe
 atelectasis demonstrated.  The right lower lobe consolidation on the other
 hand can reflect area of aspiration or rapidly developing infectious process,
 although it is less likely.
