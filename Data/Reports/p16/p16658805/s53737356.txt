                                 FINAL REPORT
 SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 Single frontal view of the chest was obtained with comparison to the
 examination performed one day previously.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A weighted feeding tube is again seen within the stomach, with interval
 removal of the previously placed guide wire.  Surgical ___ are seen behind
 the stomach shadow.
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits, aside from
 some mediastinal clips and sternotomy sutures suggesting prior CABG.
 
 There is no focal pulmonary opacity, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Minimal linear opacity seen in the left lung base probably
 represents linear atelectasis.  Osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Post-surgical changes without evidence of pneumonia.
