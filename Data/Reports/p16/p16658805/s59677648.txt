 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New nasogastric tube placement.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the Dobbhoff catheter has
 been pulled back.  The tip of the catheter now projects over the
 gastroesophageal junction.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  For correct
 positioning in the stomach, the tube needs to be advanced by approximately 10
 cm.
