                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.  Evaluate Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDING:
 
 Single frontal chest radiograph was performed.  
 
 There appears to be a guidewire within the nasogastric tube.  Weighted
 nasogastric tube is present, with the tip within the stomach.  There is not
 significant redundancy of tubing within the stomach to indicate that this
 would spontaneously be pulled into the duodenum unless the tube is advanced
 somewhat.
 
 Minimal linear atelectasis seen at the left lung base.  Sternotomy sutures are
 present.  
 
 Note is again made of a comminuted left distal clavicle fracture, previously
 seen on the torso CT of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Weighted nasogastric tube is now curled within the stomach. 
 Consider additional advancement of the tube to provide some redundency in the
 stomach if a post-pyloric position is desired.
