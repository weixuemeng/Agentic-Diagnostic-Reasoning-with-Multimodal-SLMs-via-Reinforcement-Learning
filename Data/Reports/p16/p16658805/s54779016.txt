 New elevation of left lung base and ipsilateral mediastinal shift suggest
 acute atelectasis left lower lobe which would explain new small left pleural
 effusion.  This examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of
 acute pulmonary embolism.  Lungs are otherwise clear, heart size is normal and
 the vasculature is not engorged.  Feeding tube is coiled in the stomach.
