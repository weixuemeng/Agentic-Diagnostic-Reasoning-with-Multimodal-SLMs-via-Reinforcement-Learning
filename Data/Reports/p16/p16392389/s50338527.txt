                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain  // Effusion, edema, infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is diffusely
 calcified with unchanged tortuosity.  Mediastinal contours appear similar. 
 Perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness is compatible with mild
 pulmonary edema.  More focal opacities within the right upper and lower lung
 fields raise concern for superimposed infection.  Trace bilateral pleural
 effusions are noted.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Posterior fusion
 hardware within the thoracolumbar spine is incompletely imaged.  Compression
 deformity of the thoracic vertebral body superior to the fusion hardware
 appears chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.  More focal
 opacities in the right upper and lower lung fields raise concern for
 superimposed infection.
