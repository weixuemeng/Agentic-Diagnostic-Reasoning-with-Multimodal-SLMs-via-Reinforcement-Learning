                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, evaluate for a cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  The
 heart is normal size and the mediastinal structures are unremarkable.  There
 is minimal apical pleural thickening.  Flattening of the diaphragms and an
 increased AP diameter of the chest is consistent with chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.
