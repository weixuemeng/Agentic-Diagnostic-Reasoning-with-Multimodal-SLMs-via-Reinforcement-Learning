                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, productive cough, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate overinflation with flattened diaphragms and increased
 retrosternal space.  There is a non-recent area of right upper lobe fibrosis
 with right apical pleural thickening.  Neither the frontal nor the lateral
 radiographs show acute lung changes such as recent pneumonia.  No pleural
 effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No recent pneumonia.  Nonrecent fibrotic and pleural changes in
 the right lung apex, these should be further worked up with CT, notably given
 the lack of comparison radiographs, to exclude a neoplastic process at the
 right lung apex.
 
 This information was added to the radiology dashboard.
