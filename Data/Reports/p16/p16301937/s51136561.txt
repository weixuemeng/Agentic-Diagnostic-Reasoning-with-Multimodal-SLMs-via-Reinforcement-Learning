 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardio mediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  There are lower lung volumes.  Indistinctness of engorged

 hemidiaphragm has been obscured, consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss
 in the left lower lobe.
 The remainder of the study is essentially unchanged.
