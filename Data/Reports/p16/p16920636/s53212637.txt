                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of COPD, preop.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  No definite focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mild bi-apical pleural
 thickening is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflated lungs suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  No acute cardiopulmonary process seen.
