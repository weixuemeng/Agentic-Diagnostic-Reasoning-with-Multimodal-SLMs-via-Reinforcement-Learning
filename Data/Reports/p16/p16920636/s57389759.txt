                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ___F with SCLC on chemo, COPD/home O2,
 ax-bifem and celiac stent presents with acute on chronic mesenteric ischemia
 s/p ex lap, SBR 60 cm s/p delayed closure   ileostomy now w/ tachypnea and
 increased WOB  // ?PNA vs pulm vas congestion    ?PNA vs pulm vas congestion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, the Dobhoff tube extends to the
 distal stomach.  Other monitoring and support devices are stable.
 There has been substantial increase in opacification at the bases with
 silhouetting of the hemidiaphragms, consistent with bilateral pleural
 effusions and underlying compressive atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, it would be very difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia,
 especially in the absence of a lateral view.
 Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits and there is mild engorgement
 of pulmonary vessels consistent with mild elevation in pulmonary venous
 pressure.
