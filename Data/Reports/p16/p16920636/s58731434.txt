 EXAMINATION:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  Question of NG tube displacement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dating from ___
 through ___.

 have improved as well as associated bilateral basilar atelectasis.

 2. Interval improvement of small bilateral pleural effusions and associated
 atelectasis.
