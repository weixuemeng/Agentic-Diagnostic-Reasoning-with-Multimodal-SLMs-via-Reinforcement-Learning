                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New atrial fibrillation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous and demonstrates mild
 atherosclerotic calcifications. Mediastinal contours are otherwise unchanged. 
 Hilar contours are normal. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Streaky
 opacities within the left lung base may reflect areas of atelectasis or
 scarring. T7 through T11 fusion hardware is unchanged with similar appearance
 of the compression fracture of the T9 vertebral body.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky left basilar opacity, likely atelectasis or scarring.
