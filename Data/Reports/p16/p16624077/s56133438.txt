                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post stab wound to the chest with
 left-sided pneumothorax and chest tube placement.  Evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed prior to the chest tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  New left-sided chest tube is seen entering the left lateral
 thoracic wall and ending in the left upper lung region.  Compared with prior
 exam there has been nearly complete evacuation of the left-sided pneumothorax.
 Small amount of subcutaneous gas is secondary to a chest tube placement.  The
 lungs are well inflated without focal opacities.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion.  No right-sided
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Successful evacuation of a left-sided pneumothorax after chest
 tube placement.
