                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval removal of nasogastric tube.  Right chest tube remains in
 place.  Stable postoperative mediastinal widening following esophagectomy and
 pull-up procedure.  Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion.  Slight
 improvement in left perihilar and basilar airspace opacity, which could
 reflect asymmetrical edema, aspiration or infectious pneumonia.  Bibasilar
 retrocardiac atelectasis and adjacent small right and small-to-moderate left
 pleural effusions are unchanged.
