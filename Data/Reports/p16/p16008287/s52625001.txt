                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax after esophagectomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right chest tube remains
 in place.  There is stable widening of the mediastinum following esophagectomy
 and pull-up procedure.  Pulmonary vascularity is only mildly engorged.  The
 left perihilar opacification has decreased, which could reflect improving
 edema or some resolving aspiration or infectious pneumonia.  There is evidence
 of bilateral pleural effusions with atelectatic changes at the bases.
