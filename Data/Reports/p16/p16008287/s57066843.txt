                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chemotherapy, minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy, assessment
 for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the preexisting parenchymal
 opacities have minimally decreased in extent.  Parts of these opacities is
 certainly caused by the surgical intervention, but other parts, notably in the
 perihilar areas on the left and right, are likely caused by mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema.  These edematous changes have decreased in the interval. 
 Also decreased is a moderate left pleural effusion that is better appreciated
 on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  No new parenchymal opacities. 
 Unchanged severe cardiomegaly.
