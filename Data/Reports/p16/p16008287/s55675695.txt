                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post esophageal stent removal and
 insertion; evaluate for aspiration pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post esophageal stenting with two radiopaque stents in
 place. The upper stent has been repositioned, extending from the thoracic
 inlet into the proximal esophagus to level of the carina; the lower stent
 extends from the distal esophagus to the level of the GE junction. There is no
 pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Bilateral linear and subsegmental
 atelectasis is again noted.  Previously described airspace opacities have
 resolved. There is stable cardiomegaly despite the projection.  Spinal
 degenerative changes are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post interval repositioning of esophageal stents as described above.
 Resolved airspace opacities with bilateral linear and subsegmental
 atelectasis.
 Stable cardiomegaly.
