                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post esophagectomy with pull-up procedure, right
 thoracoscopy, right and laparoscopy.  Now with worsening respiratory status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Redemonstrated are a right-sided chest tube and an upper esophageal drain.
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  As compared to the study dated ___, there has been interval increase in the opacification of the
 right middle and lower lung, as well as an interval increase in left perihilar
 opacity, both of which most likely represent aspiration. There is evidence of
 mild vascular congestion. Stable, bilateral pleural effusions are noted with
 adjacent atelectatic changes.  There is stable widening of the mediastinum
 from esophagectomy and gastric pull-up procedure.  There is evidence of p.o.
 contrast seen within the bowel in the abdomen and in the retrocardiac region. 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval increase in the opacification of the right middle lobe, right
 lower lobe, and left perihilar region.  These findings are suggestive of
 aspiration, although an infectious etiology cannot be definitively excluded. 
 
 2.  Small, bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  
 
 3.  Mild vascular congestion.
