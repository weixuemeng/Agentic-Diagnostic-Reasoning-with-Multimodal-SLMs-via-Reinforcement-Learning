                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with worsening shortness of breath after
 esophagectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Left perihilar edema developed after reexpansion of the previously collapsed
 left lower lobe between ___.  This has not cleared and now raises
 suspicion of pneumonia.  The heterogeneous opacification through the right
 lung which improved substantially on ___, indicating it was at that
 time largely edema, has returned and is heterogeneous enough to raise
 questions of aspiration to this lung as well.  There is at least a moderate
 amount of left pleural effusion which has never cleared, though it may have
 decreased since ___.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  I cannot
 evaluate the neoesophagus except to say that the outer contours of the
 mediastinum are unchanged recently.  No pneumothorax.
