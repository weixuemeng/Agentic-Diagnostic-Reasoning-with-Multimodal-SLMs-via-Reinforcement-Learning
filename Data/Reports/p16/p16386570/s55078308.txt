                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dull percussion right base  // hx right
 pleurodesis, r/o effusion      hx right pleurodesis, r/o effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle with patchy opacification in the mid to lower lung
 zones.  This all could reflect the prior pleurodesis, though in the
 appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered. The left lung is essentially clear and there is apical pleural
 thickening again seen on the right.
