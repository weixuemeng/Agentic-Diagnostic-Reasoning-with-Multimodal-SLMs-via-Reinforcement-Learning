                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness, chills.  // pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the SVC/right atrial junction. 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs are hyperinflated with mild
 emphysematous changes again noted in the lung apices.  Trace bilateral pleural
 effusions appear improved compared to the previous examinations.  Streaky
 opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis, but infection cannot be
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Known pulmonary nodules seen on
 prior chest CT are not well assessed on the current radiograph.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.  Mild
 degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Trace bilateral pleural effusions, likely improved from prior exams.  Streaky
 opacities within the lung bases may reflect atelectasis but infection cannot
 be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
