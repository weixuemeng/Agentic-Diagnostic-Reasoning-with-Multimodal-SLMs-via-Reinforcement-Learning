                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old M s/p exlap for pancreatic biopsies, now with new O2
 desaturation this morning.  // Please evaluate for possible cause of O2
 desaturation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is again seen a left-sided Port-A-Cath with distal tip projecting over
 the upper right atrium, in stable position.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unchanged in appearance.  The bilateral
 hila are stable.
 
 There has been interval increase in right basilar linear opacities, most
 notably a more prominent area of consolidation in the right lower lung zone
 which is now confluent in comparison to prior study. This may represent
 atelectasis or developing pneumonia depending upon clinical context. There are
 again seen areas of atelectasis in the left lower lung, obscuring the left
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 The previously described small right pleural effusion is not currently seen.
 There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  There are no pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased area of consolidation in the right lung base, concerning for
 developing pneumonia versus atelectasis.
