                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with syncope, loss of consciousness with left
 inspiratory crackles on exam  // eval for pulmonary edema, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous, as seen
 previously.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Coarse
 interstitial opacities are noted bilaterally, most pronounced along the
 periphery and lung bases, not substantially changed from prior in compatible
 with a chronic interstitial lung disease.  Pulmonary vasculature does not
 appear engorged.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Compression deformities involving a lower thoracic vertebral body
 in a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction appear chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic interstitial lung disease, not substantially changed from prior.  No
 new focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.
