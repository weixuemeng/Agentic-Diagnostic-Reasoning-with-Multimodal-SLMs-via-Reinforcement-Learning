                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with syncope.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The lungs show a mild background interstitial abnormality which
 is likely chronic but could also reflect mild interstitial congestion.  A
 patchy left basiliar opacity is non-specific, but may reflect minor
 atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Two mild to
 moderate compression deformities along the lower thoracic spine are of
 indeterminate age.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild interstitial abnormality which is non-specific.
 
 2.  Patchy left lower lobe opacity which is not specific, which could reflect
 minor atelectasis, although an infectious etiology is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 
 3.  Lower thoracic vertebral body compression deformities of indeterminate
 age; correlate clinically.
