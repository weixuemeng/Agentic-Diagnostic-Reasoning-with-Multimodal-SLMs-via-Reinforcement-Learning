 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with ___ ___ and ___ lower lobe collapse.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal. ___ lower lobe collapse is unchanged.  Increasing
 opacities in the right lower lobe are likely due to increasing atelectasis,
 but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Attention in followup study is
 recommended.  ET tube is in the standard position.  Residual contrast is seen
 in the colon.  PEG catheter projects in the ___ upper quadrant.
