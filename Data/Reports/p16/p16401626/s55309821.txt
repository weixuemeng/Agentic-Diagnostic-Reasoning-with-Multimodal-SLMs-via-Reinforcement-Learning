 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Lungs are hyperinflated.  Focal lingular bronchiectasis is re-
 demonstrated with increased patchy lingular opacity which may reflect airways
 disease/ infection.  Right lung is clear.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Mild to moderate
 degenerative changes are again seen in the imaged thoracolumbar spine with
 similar loss of height of an upper lumbar vertebral body.

 Focal lingular bronchiectasis with patchy lingular opacity which may reflect
 airways disease/infection.
