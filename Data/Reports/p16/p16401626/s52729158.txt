  Consolidation in the lingula which could represent pneumonia.  Given
  associated lucency with this region underlying cavitation is possible.
  Spiculated nodule projecting over the left mid lung.  Additional density at
  the right cardiophrenic angle.
  Given these findings, chest CT is suggested to further evaluate.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with AMS  // eval for pneuamonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Focal region of consolidation noted within the infrahilar region on the left
 localizing to the lingula.  There is an associated lucency with this
 consolidation.  On the frontal view, there is a somewhat spiculated nodule
 projecting over the anterior left fourth rib.  Well-circumscribed density
 silhouetting the medial right hemidiaphragm without silhouetting the right
 cardiac border is of uncertain etiology, potentially a prominent fat pad or
 other lesion such as pericardial cyst, less likely a hernia.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Consolidation in the lingula which could represent pneumonia.  Given
 associated lucency with this region underlying cavitation is possible.
 Spiculated nodule projecting over the left mid lung.
 Additional density at the right cardiophrenic angle.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  Given these findings, chest CT is suggested to further
 evaluate.
