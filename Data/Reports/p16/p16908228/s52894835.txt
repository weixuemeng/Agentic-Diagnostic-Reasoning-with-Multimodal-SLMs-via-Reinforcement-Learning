                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right IJ line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:55.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous
 catheter terminating in the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax.  There
 is interval increase and bilateral, left greater than right, a mid to lower
 lung alveolar opacities with a possible more apparent opacity projecting over
 the right upper lung.  The left hemidiaphragm is obscured which may be due to
 left basilar consolidation although underlying pleural effusion is not
 excluded.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval placement right jugular central venous catheter which terminates in
 the low SVC, without evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Interval increase in bilateral, left greater than right, alveolar opacities,
 worrisome for worsening multifocal infection with possible superimposed
 component of edema.  Left pleural effusion not excluded.
