                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with ARDS and H1N1, question change of bilateral
 opacities.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright AP chest radiograph shows no interval
 improvement in bilateral airspace consolidations, worst in the left perihilar
 region.  There may be some slight worsening at the right base laterally. 
 There remains dense retrocardiac consolidation.  No pneumothorax or definite
 pleural fluid is seen.  Supporting lines and tubes are in unchanged position.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No improvement, and possible slight worsening of bilateral
 alveolar consolidations, left greater than right.
