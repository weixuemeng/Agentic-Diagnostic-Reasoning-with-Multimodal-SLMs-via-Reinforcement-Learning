 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:29.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 multifocal opacities in the left lower lobe and possibly medial right lower
 lobe worrisome for multifocal pneumonia which were not apparent on the study
 one day prior.  There may be a small left pleural effusion.  Trace right
 pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is a chronic deformity
 at the left mid clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings worrisome for multifocal pneumonia or aspiration. 
 Possible small left and trace right pleural effusions.
