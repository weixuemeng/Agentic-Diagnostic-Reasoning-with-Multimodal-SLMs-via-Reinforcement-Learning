                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 is interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 4.0
 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm,
 the side port at the level of the GE junction, distal tip within the proximal
 stomach.  Recommend advancement so that it is well within the stomach.  Right
 internal jugular central venous catheter is again seen, terminating in the
 mid-to-lower SVC without evidence of pneumothorax.  There are extensive left
 greater than right bilateral alveolar opacities which continue to increase. 
 Differential diagnosis includes pulmonary hemorrhage with quickly moving
 infection, pulmonary hemorrhage, ARDS, component of underlying aspiration is
 not excluded.  Possible left pleural effusion again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.  Nasogastric tube side
 port at GE junction.  Recommend advancement so that it is well within the
 stomach.  Distal tip in the proximal stomach.  Worsening extensive bilateral
 left greater than right alveolar opacities.  Differential diagnoses include
 pulmonary hemorrhage, infection, ARDS, underlying component of aspiration not
 excluded.
