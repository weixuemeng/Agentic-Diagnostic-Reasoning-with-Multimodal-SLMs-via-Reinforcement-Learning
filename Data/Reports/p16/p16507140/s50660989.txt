                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON EXAM:  None.
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size and mediastinal contour are normal.  There is left hilar
 fullness. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle, is scarring or a small
 pleural effusion. Mild diffuse interstitial abnormality in both lungs and
 hyperinflation suggest chronic lung disease due to smoking.  A large area of
 heterogenous radiodensity in the axillary region of the right upper lobe has a
 mass-like configuration on the lateral view.  There is a similar but smaller
 area in the left upper lobe laterally.
 Small nodules are present in the lower lungs, particularly the right.
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Two areas of increased radiodensity, one in the right upper lobe and one
 in the left upper lobe, which in the correct clinical setting may represent
 pneumonia.
 2.  Possible left hilar lymphadenopathy. 
 3.  Possible emphysema and mild interstitial lung abnormality, probably due to
 smoking.
 4.  Possible small right lung nodules.
 5.  Chest CT with intravenous contrast is recommended to assess all these
 findings, either now or within several weeks after presumed pneumonia has been
 treated. 
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
 2:58 PM, 15 minutes after the time of discovery.
