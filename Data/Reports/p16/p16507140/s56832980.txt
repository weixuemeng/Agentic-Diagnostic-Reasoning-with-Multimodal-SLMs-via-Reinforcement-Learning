                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and CT of the chest of
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Multifocal areas of consolidation rapidly progressed between
 ___ and ___, with the appearance on CT of ___, attributed to a multifocal pneumonia.  When comparing the scout
 image from the recent CT as a surrogate for a chest radiograph at that time
 point, the main radiographic change is development of increasing volume loss
 in the right upper lobe, manifested by elevation of the minor fissure.  The
 right upper lobe remains densely consolidated, particularly centrally, and has
 more hazy ground-glass and in the periphery.  An area of combined
 consolidation and ground-glass in the periphery of the left upper lobe is
 similar to slightly improved, and a predominant ground-glass opacity within
 the right lung base is unchanged.  A new area of patchy and linear opacity has
 developed in the left lower lobe and may reflect additional site of infection.
 Poorly defined opacities in the juxtahilar regions are unchanged.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions are small and similar to the recent CT.  Fullness of the
 hilar and right paratracheal contours likely reflects reactive
 lymphadenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent multifocal consolidation and ground glass opacities, most severe in
 the right upper lobe. Worsening right upper lobe volume loss, but no evidence
 of obstructing central lesion on recent CT.  
 
 Considering infectious symptoms and the rapid progression between ___
 and ___, a multilobar pneumonia is considered most likely. 
 Differential diagnosis includes cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic
 pneumonia, and pulmonary hemorrhage/vasculitis.
