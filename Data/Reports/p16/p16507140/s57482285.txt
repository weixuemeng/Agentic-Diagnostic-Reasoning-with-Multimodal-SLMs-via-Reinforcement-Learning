                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia and a preponderance of eosinophils. 
 Evaluate for progression.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Consolidation in the right upper lobe worsened appreciably between ___ and ___ accompanied by increasing volume loss.  The consolidation has
 improved, but the volume loss has not.  Chest CT on ___ showed no
 bronchial obstruction so presumably this is due to organization in
 atelectasis.  Smaller region of consolidation in the left upper lung extending
 to the pleural periphery which also increased from ___ to ___
 has improved.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, new on ___ are stable.
 Lower lungs are grossly clear.  Heart is not enlarged.
 
 Whether the consolidation is due to infection or eosinophilic pneumonia would
 depend upon treatment history.  Given the persistent atelectasis and
 substantial residual consolidation I would repeat conventional chest
 radiographs in four to six weeks, sooner if the patient has clinical evidence
 of progression.
