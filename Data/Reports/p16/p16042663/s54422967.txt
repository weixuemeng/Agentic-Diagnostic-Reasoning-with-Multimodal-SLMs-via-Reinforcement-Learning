                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Abdominal distention and epigastric pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  Allowing for that, the cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours are probably within normal limits.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Patchy opacities in the lower lungs are probably
 due to minor atelectasis.  There is no free air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suspected minor atelectasis at the lung bases with low lung volumes.  No free
 air identified.
