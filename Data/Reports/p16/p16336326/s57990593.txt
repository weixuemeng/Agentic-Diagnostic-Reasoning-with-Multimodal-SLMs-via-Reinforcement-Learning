                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph ___ through ___, portable chest radiograph ___.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sepsis secondary to port dehiscence.  Evaluate
 interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of the left port catheter.  There
 remains a right internal jugular line with tip not well visualized but likely
 in the mid SVC.  There are low lung volumes with worsened pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Additionally, the mediastinal caliber is increased and there is
 bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsened pulmonary edema and enlarged mediastinal contour are compatible
 with heart failure.
 
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
