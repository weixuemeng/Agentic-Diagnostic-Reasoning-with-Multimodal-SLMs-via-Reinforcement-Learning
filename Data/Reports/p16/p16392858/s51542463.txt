                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post single chamber permanent pacemaker implantation, here
 to evaluate for pneumothorax and appropriate lead placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 12:15.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pectoral single-chamber pacemaker is in place with a single
 lead terminating in the right ventricle.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately
 enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits with
 mild tortuosity of the aorta.  The hilar contours are within normal limits and
 stable.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Two screws are
 noted in the left humeral head.  Moderate degenerative changes are noted in
 the bilateral acromioclavicular joints.  Moderate degenerative changes are
 noted in the lower thoracic spine.  There is kyphotic curvature.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Appropriate pacemaker lead placement with clear lungs.
