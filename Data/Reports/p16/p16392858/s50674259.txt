                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man currently being diuresed for diastolic CHF. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia or viral bronchitis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Asymmetric pulmonary edema has improved substantially since ___.  The
 residual abnormality in the right lung could also be atypical pneumonia and
 should be followed.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  No pleural effusions
 are present.  Lateral view raises the possibility of a retrosternal lung
 nodule, although this could certainly be superimposed rib.  When lungs have
 cleared of other residual abnormalities, I would recommend conventional chest
 radiographs, including oblique views.  Lateral view also suggests the
 possibility of pericardial effusion.
 
 Transvenous pacer lead follows the expected course from the left axillary
 pacemaker to the right ventricular apex.
