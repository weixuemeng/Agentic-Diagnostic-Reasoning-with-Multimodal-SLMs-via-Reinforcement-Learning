                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath, history of congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left-sided pacemaker device is noted with lead terminating in right
 ventricle, unchanged.  Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette appears
 relatively unchanged compared to the prior exam.  The aorta remains tortuous. 
 There is perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness with alveolar
 opacities most pronounced in the right lung base.  Findings are concerning for
 asymmetric moderate pulmonary edema, though infection in the right lung base
 cannot be fully excluded.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings concerning for moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema, right worse than
 left, but infection cannot be completely excluded in the right lung base. 
 Follow up radiographs after diuresis are recommended for further assessment.
