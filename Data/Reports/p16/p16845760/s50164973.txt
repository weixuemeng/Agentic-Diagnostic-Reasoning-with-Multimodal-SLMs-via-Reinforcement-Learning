                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post cysto-prostatectomy with
 ileal loop diversion, not able to wean to room air.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  One AP single chest view has been obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made to the next preceding similar study of ___.  Findings are grossly unchanged demonstrating again markedly reduced
 lung volume in the left hemithorax with marked shift of the mediastinal
 structures towards the left, indicating volume reduction, probably caused by
 chronic infections with large bronchiectatic changes on the bases as well as
 in the apical left upper lobe area.  The right lung is hyperinflated.  A
 previous preoperative chest examination of ___ is reviewed,
 compared with today's findings.  The dense bronchiectatic changes and scarring
 in the left hemithorax is grossly unaltered.  When comparing the hyperinflated
 right lung, comparison demonstrates that there exists some new mostly linear
 changes in the right lung base that did not exist previously.  Comparison with
 the next preceding single view chest examination of ___ demonstrates
 grossly unchanged findings as these linear densities existed already on the
 right base at that time.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable-appearing left-sided chronic bronchiectatic changes.  Basal right-sided
 mostly linear densities in supradiaphragmatic position existed on ___
 and are unchanged now.  It is very difficult to come to a conclusive diagnosis
 on a single view examination, particularly since we only have AP single view
 portable images available.  Followup examinations during treatment would
 possibly demonstrate that the now identified linear densities resolved.
