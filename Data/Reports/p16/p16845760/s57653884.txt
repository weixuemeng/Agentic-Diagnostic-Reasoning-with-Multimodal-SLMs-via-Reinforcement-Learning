                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  COPD, recently after surgery, assessment for
 pneumonia due to shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 The patient has substantially decreased volume of the left hemothorax due to
 substantial bronchiectasis and calcifications with re-expansion compensatory
 of the right lung.  In addition to the chronic changes, currently there is
 potentially new left lower lobe consolidation that might reflect new
 infectious process.  Intraperitoneal air most likely related to recent
 surgery.
