                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever and productive cough.  Rule out
 pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Prominence of the
 vascular markings is consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.  Increased
 interstitial markings may be chronic.  No substantial pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  Flattening of the diaphragm suggests COPD. Moderate
 cardiomegaly is similar to prior. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion superimposed on probable chronic interstitial
 changes.  Repeat PA and lateral radiographs are recommended after therapy.
