 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung
 volumes.  Endotracheal tube tip lies about 3.8 cm above the carina.  The other
 monitoring and support devices are in appropriate position.  There is some
 generalized increased opacification of the left hemithorax.  This could
 represent a technical artifact rather than a large effusion.  There is
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent with some pleural fluid as
 well as bibasilar atelectatic changes with the obscuration of a portion of the
 left hemidiaphragm consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe.
