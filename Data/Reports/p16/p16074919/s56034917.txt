                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer status post left lower lobectomy, evaluate for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Endotracheal tube 6 cm above the carina.  A right
 IJ catheter terminates in the upper SVC.  An enteric tube courses through the
 esophagus and out of the field of view, likely within the stomach.
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  There has been complete resolution of pulmonary
 edema.  Opacities at the left lung base are likely a combination of pleural
 fluid and atelectasis, unchanged.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum and
 hilar structures are unremarkable.
