                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left hilar mass, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Status post left chest tube removal.  The radiograph shows no
 evidence of an apical pneumothorax, but a small air-fluid level projecting
 over the aortopulmonary window could reflect a small ventral pneumothorax. 
 The staple line projecting over the left lower chest wall is unchanged. 
 Unchanged gas collection in the soft tissues, unchanged post-operative
 opacities in the left lung.  The right lung shows slightly improved
 ventilation at the lung bases.  Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
