                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right pleuritic chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is increased opacification posteriorly
 overlying the lower spine.  On the frontal view, there is asymmetry of
 opacification at the base with more opacification on the left.  This raises
 the possibility of pneumonia, though is not the side suggested in the clinical
 history.
