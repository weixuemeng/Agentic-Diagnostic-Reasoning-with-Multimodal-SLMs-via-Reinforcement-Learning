                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sudden desaturation and lung collapse.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 5:40.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube.  A left subclavian
 central line remains in place with its tip in the proximal SVC, likely
 abutting the lateral wall.  There has been interval appearance of retrocardiac
 opacity with an associated effusion likely reflecting partial lower lobe
 atelectasis.  In addition, there is a patchy opacity at the right base with a
 small associated effusion suggestive of compressive atelectasis.  No pulmonary
 edema. The heart remains enlarged.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.
