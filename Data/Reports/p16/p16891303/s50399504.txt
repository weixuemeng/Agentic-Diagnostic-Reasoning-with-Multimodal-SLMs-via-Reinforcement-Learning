                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Sudden onset of dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged with the leads
 again terminating in the right atrium and ventricle.  The heart appears mildly
 enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is streaky opacity obscuring the left
 hemidiaphragm suggesting minor scarring or atelectasis.  There is no evidence
 for pulmonary edema.  There is persistent mild-to-moderate relative elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm, compared to the left, particularly anteriorly,
 which may suggest an eventration.  There are similar degenerative changes
 along the thoracic spine and suspected bony demineralization.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
