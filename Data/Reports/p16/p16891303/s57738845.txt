                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, fever, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Lung volumes are
 markedly low which limits evaluation.  An AICD is unchanged with proximal lead
 in the expected location of the right atrium and distal lead in the expected
 location of the right ventricle, unchanged.  Given the low lung volumes,
 evaluation is limited, though the imaged portion of the lungs appears clear. 
 No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size appears enlarged,
 though this may be technique-related.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Markedly limited exam without definite signs of pneumonia.
