                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New PE, elevated white count, question new pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Lordotic positioning and low inspiratory volumes.  A left-sided pacemaker is
 present, with lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle.  There is
 increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation, worse compared with one day earlier.  Upper zone
 redistribution is likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes.  Otherwise,
 no evidence for CHF.  The right lung is grossly clear, without focal
 infiltrate or gross effusion.Cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, worse compared with ___.
