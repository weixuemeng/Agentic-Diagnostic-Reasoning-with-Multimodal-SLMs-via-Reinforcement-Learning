                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS:  ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with reported decreased appetite, failure to thrive
 per daughter for several days.  Poor historian.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There is a small
 region of opacity in the retrosternal clear space on the lateral view, not
 definitively seen on the frontal but potentially in the right mid lung. 
 Elsewhere, lungs are clear and the costophrenic angles are sharp. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Median sternotomy wires
 and mediastinal clips are noted.  Atherosclerotic calcifications noted within
 the thoracic aorta.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small opacity in the retrosternal clear space on the lateral
 view, potentially localizing to the right on the frontal.  This may represent
 focal infection in the proper clinical setting.  With lack of suggestive
 history, CT should be considerd to further evaluate.
