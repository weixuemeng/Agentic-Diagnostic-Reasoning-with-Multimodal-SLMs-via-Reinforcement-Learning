                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. 
 Left lung is clear.  On the right, there is poor definition of a portion of
 the hemidiaphragm with mild opacity above it.  Although this could reflect
 merely atelectasis in the postoperative state, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, a developing consolidation would have to be considered.
