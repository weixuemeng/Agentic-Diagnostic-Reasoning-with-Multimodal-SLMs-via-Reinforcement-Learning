                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath
 and diminished breath sounds on left.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  There is left lower lobe consolidation worrisome for
 pneumonia.  There is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm likely due to the
 overlying pneumonia though underlying atelectasis may be present.  There is a
 slight mid lung linear atelectasis/scarring.  The cardiac silhouette is
 difficult to accurately assess due to the left lower lung opacification
 although appears top normal.  Mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Left lower lobe consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  Recommend followup
 to resolution.
 2.  Right mid lung linear atelectasis/scarring.
