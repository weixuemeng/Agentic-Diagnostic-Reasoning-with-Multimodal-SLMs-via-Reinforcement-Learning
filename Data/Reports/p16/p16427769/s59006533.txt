                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hemoptysis, cough.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacity in the left retrocardiac region has resolved.  Subtle increased
 asymmetric opacity in the right lower lobe with corresponding increased
 retrocardiac opacity on the lateral view over the spine, could reflect an
 early pneumonia in the appropriate clinical situation. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  No pleural effusion or edema.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings concerning for focal right lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Interval follow-up chest radiographs in 4 weeks after
 antibiotic therapy are recommended to ensure resolution after treatment.  If
 the patient does not have infectious symptoms and continues to experience
 hemoptysis, chest CT would be recommended rather than followup chest
 radiographs.
