                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough for several weeks.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is top normal.  There is no
 focal consolidation.  Diffuse interstitial reticulo-nodular opacities are more
 conspicuous since priors.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Diffuse interstitial opacities are more conspicous since the prior exams and
 are concerning for an atypical infection. Pulmonary edema is felt unlikely. 
 No focal consolidation.
