                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Heart size and cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal.  Low lung volumes exaggerate bronchovascular markings,

 other findings of heart failure, intersitial pneumonia or reaction to drugs,
 prescribed or otherwise should be considered. There is no pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interstitial abnormality.  Consider interstitial pneumonia, including PCP, and
 drug induced inflammation. 
 
 Dr ___ ___ findings by telephone with Dr ___ at 8:30AM.
