                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Assess for ET and OG tube placements.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes.  Endotracheal
 tube terminates 4.6 cm above the carina.  The orogastric tube is positioned
 within the stomach.  There are diffuse bilateral airspace opacities.  There is
 minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle, suggestive of a trace pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Mild perihilar vascular congestion is
 noted.  Otherwise, hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart
 size is normal.  There is thickening of the right minor fissure.  Partially
 imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Appropriately positioned endotracheal and orogastric tubes.
 
 2.  Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities most likely reflecting moderate to
 severe pulmonary edema, with small bilateral pleural effusions.
