                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right internal jugular line placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates a right internal jugular
 catheter with tip projecting over mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.  Endotracheal and
 orogastric tubes are appropriately positioned, unchanged.  Low lung volumes. 
 Slight blunting of costophrenic angles, compatible with small trace pleural
 effusions.  There are bilateral diffuse confluent airspace opacities, right
 greater than left, slightly worse in the interval.  There is thickening of the
 right minor fissure.  Heart size is normal.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip projects over mid SVC. 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Diffuse bilateral confluent airspace opacities, right greater than left,
 most likely reflective of severe pulmonary edema, worse in the interval. Small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
