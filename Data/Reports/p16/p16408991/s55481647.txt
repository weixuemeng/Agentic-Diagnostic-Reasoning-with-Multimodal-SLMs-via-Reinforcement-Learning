                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.  ___ CT torso.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated with a moderate
 size hiatal hernia again noted.  Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic
 knob are present.  Mediastinal contours are otherwise unchanged, and the hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  New focal patchy opacity is noted within
 the periphery of the left upper lung field, with re- demonstration of clusters
 of nodules within the right upper lobe and left lower lobe, as seen on the
 prior CT from ___.  No pleural effusion, pulmonary vascular
 congestion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are mild degenerative changes in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New peripheral patchy opacity within the left upper lung field which could
 reflect an area of infection or inflammation.  Pulmonary infarct also cannot
 be excluded.
 
 Unchanged clusters of nodules within the right upper lobe and left lower lobe,
 as seen on the previous exams, which may be due to chronic infection or
 inflammation.
