                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intermittent chest pain for two weeks.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Rounded
 retrocardiac density with air-fluid level is consistent with a large hiatal
 hernia, also seen on the prior study.  There is mild adjacent atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion.  The cardiac
 silhouette is stable.  The mediastinal contours are also stable with
 calcification of the aortic knob.  Mid lung scarring is again noted.
 
 There is adjacent left base atelectasis.  An additional small focus of opacity
 adjacent to the left heart border on the frontal view, not well seen on the
 lateral view may be due to atelectasis, although an early infectious process
 is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
