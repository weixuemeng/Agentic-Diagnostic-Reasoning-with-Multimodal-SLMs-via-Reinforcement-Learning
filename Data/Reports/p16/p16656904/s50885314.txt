                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough and fever who continues to have
 desaturation when transitioning to room air.  // Any interval change?
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable in appearance. Subtle increased opacities are present in the left
 perihilar region and are accompanied by mild bronchial wall thickening. Lungs
 are otherwise clear except for linear scar atelectasis at the right base.
 Upper lung predominant emphysema is again demonstrated. Healed rib fractures
 are incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle left perihilar opacity with associated bronchial wall thickening,
 concerning for an early focus of pneumonia. Acute aspiration is an additional
 consideration.
