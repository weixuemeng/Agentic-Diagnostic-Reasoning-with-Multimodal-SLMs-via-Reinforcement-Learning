                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear similar.  There is a moderate interstitial abnormality suggestive of
 pulmonary edema.  Superimposed are more confluent opacities in the right lower
 lung, as well as a vague left upper lung opacity, probably within the lingula.
 A small-to-moderate pleural effusion is suspected with suspected loculation on
 the left.  A small right pleural effusion may be present. 
 
 New dense calcifications project over the mid mediastinum and appear to refer
 to the lower part of the sternum, which shows more irregular calcified
 appearance, than before, including suggestion of anterior increased soft
 tissue density.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings most consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Focal opacities in the right lower and left upper lungs, which may
 represent superimposed pneumonia, but are non-specific.  Short-term follow-up
 radiographs are recommended, preferably with PA and lateral technique, if
 possible, in order to reassess.
 
 3.  Small-to-moderate loculated left-sided pleural effusion.
 
 4.  New calcification projecting over the central chest that may refer to the
 sternum.  Correlation with physical findings and clinical history is
 recommended.
