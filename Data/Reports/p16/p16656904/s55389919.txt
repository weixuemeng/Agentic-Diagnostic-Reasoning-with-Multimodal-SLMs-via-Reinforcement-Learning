  1. Interval increase in mild pulmonary vascular congestion and associated
  interstitial edema with a new small to moderate left pleural effusion.
  2. Right lung base opacity is most likely related to pulmonary edema, however
  superimposed infectious process is possible in the proper clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea, evaluate for fluid overload, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild interstitial pulmonary edema have
 increased compared with the prior study with new small to moderate left and
 trace right pleural effusions.  Right lung base opacity is most likely related
 to pulmonary edema, however a superimposed infectious process is difficult to
 exclude.  Hyperinflation is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval increase in mild pulmonary vascular congestion and associated
 interstitial edema with a new small to moderate left pleural effusion.
 2. Right lung base opacity is most likely related to pulmonary edema, however
 superimposed infectious process is possible in the proper clinical setting.
 3. COPD
