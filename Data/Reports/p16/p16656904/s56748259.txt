                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 continued mild increase in interstitial markings bilaterally suggesting
 moderate pulmonary edema.  There is an opacity along the lateral left
 mid-to-lower hemithorax which may be due to pleural thickening, also seen on
 the prior study.  Superomedial to this, there is patchy opacity in the left
 mid lung seen on the prior study, although new since ___.  There may be
 trace bilateral pleural effusions as blunting of the posterior costophrenic
 angles is seen on the lateral view.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There has been
 interval decrease in right base opacity.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  Previously seen dense calcifications
 over the mid mediastinum are no longer seen.  Left axillary stent is also not
 seen, but may not be included on the image.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
 2.  Interval decrease in right base opacity.
 3.  Left mid-to-lower lung opacity which may represent loculated pleural
 effusion or possibly pleural thickening with pulmonary opacity has persisted
 since ___.  The findings may relate to loculated pleural effusion or
 other pulmonary lesion.  Given that findings have persisted since ___,
 recommend chest CT followup.
