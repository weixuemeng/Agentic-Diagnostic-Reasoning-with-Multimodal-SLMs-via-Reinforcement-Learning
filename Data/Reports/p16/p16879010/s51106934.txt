 INDICATION:  Persistent tachycardia and shortness of breath in a patient
 status post cesarean section.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a heart which is normal in
 size. The lungs are fairly well aerated, without focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  A small amount of free air under the diaphragm is
 likely post-surgical.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
