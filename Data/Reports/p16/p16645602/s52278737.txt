                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Confusion, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright view of the chest was provided.  The vagal nerve
 stimulator is again seen projecting over the left lower hemithorax, with
 catheter extending into the left neck.  Lung volumes are low which limits
 evaluation.  Mild interstitial edema may be present, though technique and low
 lung volumes limit evaluation.  There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures
 are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Equivocal for mild interstitial edema.  Otherwise, no acute
 findings.
