 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The study is
 somewhat limited by patient's lordotic position and low lung volumes.  A vagal
 stimulator projects over the left hemithorax with a catheter extending to the
 neck.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis is noted. The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal
 allowing for low volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study. Mild bibasilar atelectasis. No acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
