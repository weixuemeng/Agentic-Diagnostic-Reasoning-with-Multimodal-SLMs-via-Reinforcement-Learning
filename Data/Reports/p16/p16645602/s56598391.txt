 ?pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are appreciably lower today, accounting for increased density at
 the lung bases due to atelectasis.  Low lung volumes exaggerate heart size
 which is probably top-normal and pulmonary vascular caliber, but there is no
 pulmonary edema. Pleural effusions are small if any.
