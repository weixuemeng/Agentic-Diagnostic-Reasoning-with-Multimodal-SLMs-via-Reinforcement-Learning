                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F in respiratory distress
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged. The
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Diffuse hazy ill-defined opacities are
 noted in the lungs, more extensive than compared to the previous exam.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions persist, not substantially changed in the
 interval. Bibasilar atelectasis remains similar compared to the prior exam.
 Assessment for pneumothorax is limited on this exam due to the patient's chin
 and neck soft tissues obscuring the lung apices, though no large pneumothorax
 is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse hazy opacities in the lungs, progressed since the previous study. This
 could reflect worsening multifocal pneumonia though an element of superimposed
 pulmonary edema may be present. Small bilateral pleural effusions persist, and
 there is continued bibasilar atelectasis.
