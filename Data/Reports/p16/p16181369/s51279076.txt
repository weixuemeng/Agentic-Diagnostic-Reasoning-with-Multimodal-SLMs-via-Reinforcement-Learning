                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chf exacerbation, intubated transfer  // eval
 ETT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 3.7 cm above the carina. NG tube terminates below
 the diaphragm. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle is noted. . Linear opacities in left lung base
 are consistent with scarring or atelectasis. Increased interstitial markings
 suggest either edema or chronic interstitial lung disease. A vague opacity in
 the periphery of the right upper lung at the level of the second anterior rib,
 suboptimally evaluated on this single frontal view. No focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate left pleural effusion or pleural thickening with adjacent linear
 atelectasis and or scar.
 
 2. Upper and mid lung reticular opacities could reflect acute interstitial
 edema or chronic interstitial lung disease.
 
 2. Possible right upper lobe nodule versus scar, for which dedicated PA and
 lateral chest radiographs are recommended following extubation.
