                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:03 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with chest tube to waterseal.  Evaluate for
 pneumo.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 5:50 a.m.:
 
 Endotracheal tube has been removed.  Tiny left apical pneumothorax is new or
 newly apparent.  Lung volumes are greater, and there is less distention of
 mediastinal and pulmonary vessels indicating improved hemodynamic status. 
 Left lung base, however, has grown more radiopaque and whether this is
 residual dependent edema or developing consolidation will require followup
 radiographs.  Right lower lobe is largely atelectatic and moderate right
 pleural effusion persists.  Bilateral pleural drains are unchanged in their
 respective positions.
