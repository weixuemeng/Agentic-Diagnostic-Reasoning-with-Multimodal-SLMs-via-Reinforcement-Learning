                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with a gunshot wound and injury to liver and
 diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Multiloculated right pleural collections, the largest fissural, have developed
 since ___ following removal of the right pleural drain, although there
 was still substantial pleural effusion at that time, most of which was
 previously dependent.  Chest CTA performed after this study, but available at
 the time of its review shows pleural fluid loculated along costal,
 mediastinal, diaphragmatic and fissural pleural surfaces as well as evidence
 of a small pneumatocyst in the right upper lobe posterior segment that may
 have been a result of a traumatic chest tube placement.
 
 Left lung is grossly clear.  Heart size is normal.  No pneumothorax.
