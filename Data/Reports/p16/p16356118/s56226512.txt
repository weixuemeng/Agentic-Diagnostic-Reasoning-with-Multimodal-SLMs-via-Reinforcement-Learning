                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:44 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old patient after gunshot, liver and diaphragm repair.  Left
 chest tube placed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large left pneumothorax has increased despite placement of left
 pleural drain, raising questions about the location and/or function of the
 drain.  By the time this study was available for review, 10:55 a.m., the left
 pneumothorax had been treated.  No notification was necessary.
 
 There is no appreciable right pneumothorax, pleural drain in place.  Severe
 atelectasis persists at the right lung base.  Heart size normal, though
 rightward mediastinal shift suggests possibility of hemodynamic tension.
