                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post diaphragmatic injury after a gunshot wound.  Evaluate
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 5:02.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again, there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with an
 unchanged opacity at the right base, and likely a small right pleural
 effusion.  There is no right pneumothorax.
 
 There is an unchanged pigtail catheter overlying the left hemithorax.  A new
 thin linear density along the left apex may represent a tiny apical
 pneumothorax.  Alternatively, given that it was not definitely seen on prior
 exam, could represent a skin fold.  This is no left consolidation or pleural
 effusion.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Surgical clips in the right upper
 abdomen are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible tiny left apical pneumothorax.  Otherwise, no
 significant change from the prior exam.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 1:15 p.m. on ___ via telephone
 by Dr. ___ at the time the findings were discovered.
