                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Trauma with liver laceration and diaphragmatic rupture status post
 repair and right rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.  Also chest CT from the prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral chest tubes appear in unchanged positions.  There is also
 a peritoneal drain projecting over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen as
 well as multiple surgical clips.  A small-to-moderate right-sided pneumothorax
 appears probably increased slightly.  Near the entry site of the chest tube on
 the right, a small quantity of emphysema is probably unchanged in extent. 
 Opacification of the right lower and right middle lobes is probably due to
 substantial atelectasis which has not improved.  Streaky left mid-to-lower
 lung opacities are also unchanged, suggesting a lesser degree of atelectasis. 
 There is no definite pleural effusion on the left or persistent pneumothorax
 on that side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small suspected increased in right-sided pneumothorax allowing
 for differences in technique.
