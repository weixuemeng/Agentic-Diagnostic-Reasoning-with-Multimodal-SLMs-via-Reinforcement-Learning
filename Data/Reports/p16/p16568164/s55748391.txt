 A right subclavian infusion port ends in the mid SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.  Rightward mediastinal shift, elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm and the appearance of the right infrahilar lung
 suggests substantial lower lobe atelectasis.  Atelectasis in the left lower
 lung is less severe.  Pleural effusions are small if any.
