                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AML, worsening hypoxia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___, there is a progressively increasing opacity
 throughout the right lung and also at the left base.  There is new obscuration
 of the left hemidiaphragm.  Pleural fluid and/or thickening tracking along the
 right lung is similar.  No left-sided upper zone redistribution.  Probable
 small left effusion.  There is suggestion of asymmetric caliber of the right
 greater than left main stem bronchus, though this is less pronounced than on
 the earlier film.  
 
 A right-sided PICC line is present.  The tip is not visualized due to
 underpenetration. No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) New/worsening left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, concerning for
 an area of pneumonic infiltrate.
 
 2) Worsening opacity in the right lung diffusely could reflect worsening
 pneumonic infiltrate as well.
