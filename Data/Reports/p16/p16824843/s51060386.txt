                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:53 P.M. ON ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with AML.  Acutely dyspneic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Despite the designation of this study as an "upright" view there is new
 thickening of the lateral costal pleural margin which is most readily
 explained by nondependent pleural fluid.  Multifocal consolidation in the
 right lung was shown by the chest CT on ___ and what is probably
 pneumonia is still present.  Infrahilar left lower lobe was substantially
 atelectatic on the chest CT and that has not changed.  Heart is mildly
 enlarged.  Widening of the mediastinum at the level of the aortic arch is due
 to combination of mediastinal fat deposition and enlarged lymph nodes.
 
 Right subclavian or PIC line ends in the lowest third of the SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
