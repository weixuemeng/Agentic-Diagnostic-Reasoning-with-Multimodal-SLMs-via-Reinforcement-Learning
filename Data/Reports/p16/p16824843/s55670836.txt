                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with AML after chemo, with
 neutropenia, now passing slight mucus.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 Left central venous line tip is at the level of junction of left
 brachiocephalic vein and SVC.  Mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal widening due
 to mediastinal lipomatosis are unchanged.  Right lower lobe opacity appears to
 be slightly progressed since prior study, but still most likely reflect
 atelectasis.  Theoretically, infectious process is a possibility, but can be
 better characterized with chest CT.  There is interval improvement of left
 basal opacities.  No new consolidations have been demonstrated.  Loculated
 right pleural effusion is redemonstrated.  Left apical opacity is unchanged,
 projecting over the anterior aspect of the second rib/scapula.
