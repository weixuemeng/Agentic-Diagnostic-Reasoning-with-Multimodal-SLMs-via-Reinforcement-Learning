 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  AML, constrictive pericarditis, status post drainage of
 pericardial fluid, pneumonia; to look for any worsening of pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest view was read in comparison with most

 IMPRESSION:  Right PICC line tip is at lower SVC.  Moderate right pleural
 effusion with fluid tracking along the right chest till the apex and right
 lower lung opacity due to a combination of atelectasis and effusion is
 unchanged.  Diffuse right lung consolidation, which is concerning for
 pneumonia in the given clinical setting is similar since ___, but
 worse since ___.  Increased retrocardiac density reflecting left
 lower lung consolidation and/or atelectasis and presumed small left pleural
 effusion are unchanged.  Top normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.
