                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of pneumonia, dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patchy right lower lobe opacity is seen, as well as a second focus
 in the right mid lung zone, which may be due to atelectasis; however,
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  This finding is new compared to the
 prior study.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity at the right lung base is nonspecific, appears
 more prominent as compared to the prior study and could be due to atelectasis,
 although underlying infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  PA and lateral views may be helpful for further and better
 evaluation.
