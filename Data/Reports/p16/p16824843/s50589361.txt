                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ALL with increased somnolence, question consolidation.  
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increased volume loss at the right base with linear
 atelectasis. Given the increased opacity, a small early infiltrate in this
 region could be missed.  A lateral film would be helpful for further
 evaluation if clinically indicated.  The left subclavian line has been
 removed.  The right-sided PICC line is unchanged.  The left lung is clear.
