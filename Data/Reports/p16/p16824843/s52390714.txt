                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with AML who is neutropenic, on broad-spectrum
 antibiotics, worsened tachypnea, for evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 REPORT:  Note made of mild cardiomegaly.  The left-sided central line
 terminates in the proximal SVC.
 
 There are generalized increased lung markings.  Some patchy linear atelectasis
 in the right base is seen.  A large lobulated contour abnormality of the right
 upper lung zone probably reflects a loculated pleural effusion and there is
 background mild pulmonary overload.  No sizeable effusion on the left side. 
 No definitive pneumothorax or acute cardiopulmonary finding.
 CONCLUSION
 The overall appearance is unchanged.  Mild pulmonary edema, large loculated
 right effusion.  The multifocal patchy abnormalities identified in chest CT
 are not particularly well seen on current chest radiograph.
