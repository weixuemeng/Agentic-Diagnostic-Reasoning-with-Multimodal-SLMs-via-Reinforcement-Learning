                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with smoking, now unexplained lobar
 hemorrhage, assess for nodes or mass.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's outside chest film from ___.
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest are submitted ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Streaky linear
 opacities at left base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis given their
 absence on the comparison study from earlier in the day.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear without evidence of pleural effusions, focal airspace consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  Overall, there are slightly less vascular markings in the upper
 lungs relative to the lower lungs which suggests a component of underlying
 emphysema given the patient's history of smoking.  If a lung primary remains
 of clinical concern, further imaging evaluation with CT should be considered.
