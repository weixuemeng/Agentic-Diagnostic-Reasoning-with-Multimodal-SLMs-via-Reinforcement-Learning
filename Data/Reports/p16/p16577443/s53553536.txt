                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with symptoms of TIA, here to evaluate for
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso with contrast dated ___.  Otherwise, no
 prior studies are available for comparison.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the chest is limited due to low inspiratory lung
 volumes and slight patient rotation with resultant prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and lung markings due to under-inflation.  Within
 this limitation, there is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected, although evaluation at the
 lung apices is limited due to superimposition of cervicocranial soft tissues. 
 Streaky retrocardiac opacities most likely reflect atelectasis in the setting
 of low lung volumes.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is
 no overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, with
 unfolding of the thoracic aorta and mild calcification of the aortic knob. 
 The trachea is slightly deviated to the right by the aortic arch.  There is no
 free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm on this semi-erect view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited evaluation of the chest with low lung volumes and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
