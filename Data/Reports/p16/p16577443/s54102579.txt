                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Desaturation with previous atelectasis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette in a patient with relatively low lung volumes. 
 No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.  On the
 lateral view, there is suggestion of some increased opacification in the
 retrocardiac region, which could raise the possibility of developing
 consolidation.
