                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient with multilobar pneumonia or fluid
 overload.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are stable.  Extensive diffuse
 bilateral opacities have markedly increased in the right upper lobe consistent
 with worsening pneumonia.  Mild pulmonary edema is stable.  Right basal
 pigtail catheter remains in place.  There is a small right pneumothorax.  Left
 pleural effusion is small.  Lines and tubes are in standard position.
