                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea with right lower lobe crackles.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is
 extensive airspace opacity within the right lung, which is concerning for
 multifocal pneumonia.  Additionally, there is left lower lobe retrocardiac
 opacity which could represent atelectasis or scarring as it appears stable
 from prior exam.  Otherwise, the left lung appears grossly unchanged.  A
 component of mild edema is difficult to exclude.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears grossly stable.  Bony structures are intact.  A tiny right pleural
 effusion is difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive consolidation in the right lung is concerning for
 pneumonia.  Possible superimposed mild edema.  Followup to resolution is
 recommended.
