                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest tube to waterseal, assess pleural effusions.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed eight hours earlier.
 
 Moderate right effusion is unchanged.  Diffuse bilateral lung opacities,
 larger in the right lung, are also stable. Lines and tubes are in standard
 position.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Right pigtail catheter
 remains in the right lower hemithorax.
