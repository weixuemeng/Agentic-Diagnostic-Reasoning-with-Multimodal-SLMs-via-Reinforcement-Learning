                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with right-sided parapneumonic effusion,
 status post chest tube placement, evaluate for possible pneumothorax and
 assess right-sided chest tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study obtained on ___.  The patient remains intubated, the ETT
 terminating in the trachea some 4 cm above the level of the carina. 
 Comparison with the next preceding study, a right-sided lateral chest wall
 approach small caliber pigtail terminating terminating chest tube has been
 placed.  Drainage of the pleural effusion must have been effective as the
 previously existing right-sided density has decreased markedly so that the
 right-sided diaphragm can now be identified.  The lateral pleural sinus,
 however, appears still to be mildly blunted.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax on either side in the apical area.  Some degree of perivascular
 haze exists in both lungs, similar as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Appropriate placement of pigtail chest tube right base with
 effective elimination of previously existing pleural effusion.
