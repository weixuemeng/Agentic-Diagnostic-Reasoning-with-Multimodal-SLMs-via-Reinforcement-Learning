                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, but bilateral pulmonary edema
 has dramatically improved with only minimal residual perihilar haziness
 remaining, accompanied by peribronchial cuffing and pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  Left retrocardiac opacity has also improved and probably
 represents a combination of atelectasis and dependent edema.  Additional
 linear areas of atelectasis are noted posteriorly at the lung bases on the
 lateral view, and there are also small pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement in pulmonary edema.  Improving left
 retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis, but continued followup may be
 helpful to exclude underlying pneumonia given clinical suspicion for this
 entity.
