  No evidence of acute disease.
  Increased apparent mediastinal widening on the right side with suggestion of
  lobulation; evaluation with chest CT is suggested when clinically appropriate;
  differential considerations include a mass, lymphadenopathy or increasing
  aneurysm.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, pneumonia.  The patient presents with
 dizziness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again moderately enlarged.  The descending aortic
 contour is again tortuous and there is dilatation of the aorta.  In addition,
 the mediastinum appears wider on the right side than previously seen as well
 as mildly lobulated.  This appearance could be associated with new
 lymphadenopathy or even a mass in the mediastinum versus primarily increase in
 the size of the aorta.  The lung fields appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  Mild compression deformities are similar along the
 mid-to-lower thoracic spine.  These include a moderate anterior wedge
 compression deformity at the thoracolumbar junction that appears similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease, including pneumonia or congestive heart
 failure.  
 
 2.  Abnormal mediastinal contour including enlarged aorta and increased
 apparent lobular widening of the right mediastinum.  Although the technique is
 different, this appearance raises concern for lymphadenopathy, mass or
 possibly increasing aortic aneurysm.  
 
 Evaluation with chest CT is recommended when clinically appropriate,
 preferably with intravenous contrast.
