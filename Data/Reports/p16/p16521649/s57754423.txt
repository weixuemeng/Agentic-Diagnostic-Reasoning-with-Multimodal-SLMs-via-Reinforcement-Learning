                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with tracheal stenosis add-on OR  // preop clearance
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT trachea ___ at 14:35
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Widening of the superior mediastinum due to known thyroid goiter is re-
 demonstrated with narrowing of the trachea, better visualized on the recent
 CT.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged, and the mediastinal contours are
 similar with diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta.
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is re- demonstrated with a small left
 pleural effusion.  Assessment for a right pleural effusion is somewhat limited
 as the posterior right costophrenic angle is not completely included on the
 lateral view.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.  There
 are multilevel degenerative changes demonstrated in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widening of the superior mediastinum due to thyroid goiter with tracheal
 narrowing, better assessed on the recent CT exam.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion and small left pleural effusion.
