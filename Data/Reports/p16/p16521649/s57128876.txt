                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with congestive heart failure exacerbation status
 post Lasix at outside hospital
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph at ___, ___ at 9:27
 from outside hospital
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the most recent previous exam, there is persistent mild pulmonary
 edema with upper zone vascular redistribution, perihilar haziness and vascular
 indistinctness, slightly worse in the interval.  Heart size remains mild to
 moderately enlarged.  The aorta is calcified diffusely.  Mediastinal contours
 are unchanged with multiple clips again noted about the superior mediastinum. 
 More focal opacity in the left lung base towards the costophrenic angle may
 reflect an area of atelectasis with small pleural effusion, however infection
 is not excluded.  No pneumothorax is clearly identified.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, slightly worse in the interval.  Focal opacity in the
 left lung base towards the costophrenic angle may reflect an area of
