 interval change      assess for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is now a tracheostomy tube in
 place with no evidence of complication. Otherwise, little change in the
 appearance of the heart and lungs.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and
 there is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification at the left base most likely reflects
 pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
