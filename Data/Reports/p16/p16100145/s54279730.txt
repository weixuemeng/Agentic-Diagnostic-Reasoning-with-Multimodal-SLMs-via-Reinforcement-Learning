                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath, known pneumonia  // eval
 interval change for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes exaggerate the cardiomediastinal contours.  Large
 retrocardiac hiatal hernia is unchanged compared to multiple prior exams. 
 There has been an interval increase in ill-defined, bilateral perihilar
 opacities, as well as a small right pleural effusion. Mild bibasilar
 atelectasis has also increased compared to the prior exam. There is no
 pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval increase in ill-defined opacities overlying the lung fields
 bilaterally is likely secondary to mild pulmonary edema, however an underlying
 infectious process cannot be excluded.
 
 2. Stable large hiatal hernia.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Updated findings were d/w Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by phone
