                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  INCREASING TOTAL ___ ___. QUESTION INFECTION.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An nasogastric tube again terminates in the stomach where it makes a single
 loop. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is
 vague diffuse increase in opacity in the right lung compared to the left,
 particularly involving the lower part of the lung, raising suspicion for
 developing pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Developing opacification of the right lung worrisome for early evidence of
 pneumonia. Short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful to reassess.
