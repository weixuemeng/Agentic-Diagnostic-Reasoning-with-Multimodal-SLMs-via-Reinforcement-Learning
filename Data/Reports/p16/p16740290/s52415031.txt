                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged, and the pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.  Right
 apical scarring is unchanged.  4 mm calcified nodule in the right mid lung
 field is unchanged, likely a granuloma.  Lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation.  Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angle on the right
 posteriorly may suggest the presence of the trace pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  There are no acute osseous findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible trace right pleural effusion posteriorly.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
