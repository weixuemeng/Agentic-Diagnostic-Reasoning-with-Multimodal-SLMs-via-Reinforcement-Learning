                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, to assess for clearing.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial
 decrease in the opacification at both bases, consistent with effective
 clearing of the previously described pneumonia.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs
 is consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  Continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette without definite focal pneumonia.  Hyperexpansion of the
 lungs is consistent with chronic pulmonary disease and a small hiatal hernia
 is noted.  There is blunting of the costophrenic angles with some atelectatic
 changes at the bases.  Prominence of the right hilum persists, though a recent
 CT scan apparently showed no evidence of nodule or lymphadenopathy.
