                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall on right side of chest.  Assess for pneumonia, pneumothorax,
 or rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired.  Lung
 volumes are slightly low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and
 accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is consolidative left
 mid-to-lower lung opacification with streaky opacities in right lower lung,
 concerning for infection versus aspiration.  A concomitant small left pleural
 effusion is likely.  There is no right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Although difficult to accurately assess, the heart size is likely
 mildly enlarged, not significantly changed.  No definite rib fractures are
 identified.  There is incompletely assessed spinal fusion hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bilateral lower lung opacities, left greater than right, concerning for
 infection or aspiration.
 
 2.  Small left pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Mild cardiac enlargement.
