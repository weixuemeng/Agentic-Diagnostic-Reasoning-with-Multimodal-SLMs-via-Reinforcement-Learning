                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Confusion, assess for infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  The lung volumes
 are low.  There is very subtle opacity at the medial right lung base which
 could represent a confluence of bronchovasculature though in the correct
 clinical setting an early consolidation is difficult to exclude.  Elsewhere,
 the lungs are clear.  The heart and mediastinal contour appears normal.  The
 imaged osseous structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  A subtle opacity in the medial right lung base which could
 represent a very subtle pneumonia.  Otherwise normal.
