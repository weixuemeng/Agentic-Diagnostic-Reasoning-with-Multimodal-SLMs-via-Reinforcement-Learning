                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post recent left pleural decortication.  Two
 chest tubes extend to the left apex, and a third has a basilar location.  A
 left basilar hydropneumothorax has decreased in size since the prior
 radiograph.  There has also been some improved aeration at the left base, but
 there remains considerable atelectasis in this region.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is new, and a small right pleural effusion has slightly increased.
