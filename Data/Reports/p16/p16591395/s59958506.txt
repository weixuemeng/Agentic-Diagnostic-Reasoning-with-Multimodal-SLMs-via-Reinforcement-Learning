                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Previous left lower lobe pneumonia, question aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CT on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  The peribronchial streaky
 opacities in the left lower lobe are slightly decreased.  Band-like
 atelectasis in left lower lobe is unchanged.  There is a possible new vague
 opacity in the right lower lobe; however, this may represent overlapping
 shadows from the anterior ribs and vessels.  The upper lung zones are clear. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There is minimal elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight decrease in left lower lobe streaky opacities consistent with prior
 pneumonia.  This may represent scarring or possibly chronic aspiration.
 
 2.  Vague right lower lobe opacity may represent a confluence of shadows. 
 Recommend oblique views for better evaluation.  
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 2:07 p.m. on
 ___ by telephone.
