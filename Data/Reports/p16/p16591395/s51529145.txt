                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CIDP, suspicion for aspiration event, new
 coarse lung sounds  // assess for consolidation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is scoliotic and rotated to his left.  The lung volumes are
 adequate on the right, but decreased on the left.  The retrocardiac opacity,
 seen on prior chest x-ray, has improved.  This opacity could represent a
 consolidation from infectious causes or an opacification due to atelectasis. 
 There is a minimal left pleural effusion.  The right costophrenic angle is
 unremarkable.  The heart size and mediastinal vasculature is less apparent,
 likely reflecting improved congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved left lower lobe atelectasis or pneumonia.
