 INDICATION: Pneumonia, assessment for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral upright views of the chest were obtained.  Compared
 to the most recent study there has been interval improvement of focal left
 lower lung consolidation which could represent residual pneumonia or
 superimposed atelectasis. The right-sided subclavian PICC line is unchanged in
 location and ends in the upper portion of the inferior vena cava.  The bones
 and soft tissues are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement of left-sided pneumonia. Residual left lower
 lung consolidation could be residual pneumonia or superimposed atelectasis.
