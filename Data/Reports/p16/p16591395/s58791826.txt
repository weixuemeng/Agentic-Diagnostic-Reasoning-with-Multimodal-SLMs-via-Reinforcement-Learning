                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness  // acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to the prior examination dated ___, there has been no
 significant interval change.  There is persistent hyperexpansion of the right
 lung secondary to emphysema.  Significant left lower lobe atelectasis and
 near- complete collapse is stable.  The upper lungs are grossly clear
 bilaterally.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent, severe left lower lobe consolidative opacity likely represents
 near-complete lobar collapse, although superimposed infection is difficult to
 exclude.
