                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypotension
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The mediastinal contour is similar
 with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis
 though infection is not excluded, and findings are not substantially changed
 since the previous radiograph.  Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus also
 suggests a small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 Marked degenerative changes are seen involving both shoulders.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis or infection, not substantially
 changed in the interval.  Trace left pleural effusion.
