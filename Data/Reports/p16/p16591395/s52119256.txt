                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ? pneumonia vs bronchitis while out of the
 country the last few months, ? aspiration, previous CXR with left lower lobe
 streaky peribronchiolar opacities.  // assess for infiltrate    assess for
 infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again hyperexpansion of the
 lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. The areas of opacification at
 the left base again could well reflect scarring or chronic aspiration.  Of
 course, given these changes, the possibility of superimposed more recent
 aspiration would be difficult to exclude.
