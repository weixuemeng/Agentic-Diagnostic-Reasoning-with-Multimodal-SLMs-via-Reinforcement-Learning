                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  CHF, COPD, respiratory failure.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day before.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  Left lower lobe
 retrocardiac opacities have increased from ___, probably stable from ___.  Right lower lobe consolidation and right perihilar opacities are stable. 
 Mild vascular congestion is stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal consolidations are likely multifocal pneumonia with
 worsening opacities in the left lower lobe.  This could be due to increasing
 atelectasis or worsening pneumonia.
 
 Stable mild vascular congestion.
