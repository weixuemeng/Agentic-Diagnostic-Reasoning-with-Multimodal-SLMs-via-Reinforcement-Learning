                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, change from prior, advancement of ET tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  Mid and left lower chest wall excluded from
 the film.  
 
 An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 5.1 cm above the carina,
 corresponding to the lower edge of the medial clavicular heads, slightly lower
 than on the prior film.  Allowing for technical limitations, cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is probably unchanged.  There is probable CHF, with vascular
 blurring, minimally improved at the right base.  A small right effusion is
 present.  There is retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, which, allowing for the technical limitations,
 is probably unchanged.  The presence or absence of left effusion cannot be
 assessed on this film due to positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) ET tube slightly lower, 5.1 cm above the carina.
 2) Asymmetric CHF findings, slightly improved on the right.  
 3) Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  
 4) The possibility of associated pneumonic infiltrates cannot be excluded.
