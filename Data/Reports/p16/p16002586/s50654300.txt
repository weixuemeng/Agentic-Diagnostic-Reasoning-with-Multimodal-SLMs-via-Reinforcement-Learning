                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with leukocytosis with cough and probably right
 pleural effusion.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is stable.  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
 Right lower lobe atelectasis have worsened.  Right pleural effusion is likely
 unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.  The pleural
 effusion appears to be loculated.  Left lower lobe opacities are unchanged,
 could be atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
