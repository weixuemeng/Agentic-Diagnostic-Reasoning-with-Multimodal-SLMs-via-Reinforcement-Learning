                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with lung cancer, metastatic, DOE, gait instability 
 // ?disease progression, new cpd
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous and calcified particularly
 at the aortic knob.  Enlargement of the right hilum is compatible with the
 presence of an underlying mass, which appears somewhat decreased in size
 compared to the previous chest radiograph.  Previously noted pleural and
 pulmonary nodules in the right lung are less conspicuous on the current chest
 radiograph compared to the prior study.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  There is a small right pleural effusion
 which appears relatively unchanged from the prior chest CT.  No new focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously noted right hilar mass and multiple right pulmonary and pleural
 based nodules are either decreased in size or not as well seen as compared to
 the prior chest radiograph.  No new focal consolidation.  Trace right pleural
 effusion, unchanged.
