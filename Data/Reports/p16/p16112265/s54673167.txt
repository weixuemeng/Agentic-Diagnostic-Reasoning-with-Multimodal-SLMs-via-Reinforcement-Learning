  Numerous bilateral patchy nodular opacities likely related to patient's known
  metastatic disease.
  
  More confluent left mid to lower lung patchy opacities could be due to
  consolidation from infection or pulmonary contusion in the setting of trauma.
  
  No pleural effusion seen.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent fall, face and head pain, knee and lower
 leg pain on right, pain on chest with palpation, left shoulder pain  // face
 and head pain, knee and lower leg pain on right, pain on chest with palpation,
 left shoulder pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ head CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  Numerous patchy nodular opacities seen
 in the lung fields bilaterally most likely relate to patient's known
 metastatic disease.  More confluent patchy opacities in the left mid to lower
 lung could be due to areas of focal consolidation from infection or pulmonary
 contusion in the setting of trauma.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No obvious
 displaced rib fracture seen although the study has low sensitivity for the
 detection of such.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 metastatic disease.
 
 More confluent left mid to lower lung patchy opacities could be due to

 No pleural effusion seen.
