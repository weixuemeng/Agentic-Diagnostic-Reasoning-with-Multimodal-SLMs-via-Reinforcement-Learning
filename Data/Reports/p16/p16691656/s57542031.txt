                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post PEA arrest with an endotracheal tube in place.  Evaluate
 tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Single portable frontal chest radiograph was performed.  An
 endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, 4 cm above the carina.  A left
 pectoral dual lead pacemaker is unremarkable.
 
 There are bilateral perihilar opacities with prominence of the pulmonary
 interstitium, consistent with mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Consolidation posterior to the cardiac silhouette is presumably
 atelectasis, although, aspiration would be difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactory endotracheal tube position.  
 2.  Mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
