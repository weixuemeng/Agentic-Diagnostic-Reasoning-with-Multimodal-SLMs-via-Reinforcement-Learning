                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Recently placed endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm
 above the carina.  Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiomediastinal contours
 and result in crowding of bronchovascular structures.  Patchy and linear areas
 of atelectasis at the bases are new.  Lungs are otherwise grossly clear
 allowing for limited assessment related to low lung volumes.
