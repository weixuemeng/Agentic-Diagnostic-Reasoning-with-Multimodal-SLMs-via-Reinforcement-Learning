                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  What was originally questioned as a cluster of small nodular
 opacities projecting over the left chest is is at least in part if not
 entirely an external device.  CT scanning is not indicated.  Instead a repeat
 frontal view should be obtained with a device removed to confirm that the lung
 is indeed free of nodules.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with UGIB, epigastric tenderness, evaluate for free
 subdiaphgramatic air.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Combination of mild pulmonary vascular congestion, septal interstitial lines
 at the right base, and bronchial cuffing, new since ___ could be early acute
 cardiac decompensation or, alternatively, chronic.  Heart size top-normal.  No
 pleural effusion.
 
 Projecting over the anterior left fifth rib is a complex of small nodular
 opacities.  Some of this could be the left nipple, but not all of it.  Lung
 nodules are presumed and should be evaluated with chest CT scanning.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Possible early congestive heart failure.
 2. Chest CT indicated for possible new left lung nodule.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT indicated for possible new left lung nodule.
