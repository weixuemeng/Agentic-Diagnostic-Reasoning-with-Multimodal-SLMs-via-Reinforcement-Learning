 INDICATION:  History of shortness of breath, evaluate for COPD/infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a subtle increase in opacification overlying the left
 lower lobe in the retrocardiac region which could be secondary to scarring;
 however, an acute infectious process cannot be excluded.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Note is made of sternotomy wires which appear to be intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Subtle increase in opacification overlying the left lower lobe which could be
 secondary to scarring; however, an acute infectious process cannot be
 excluded.
