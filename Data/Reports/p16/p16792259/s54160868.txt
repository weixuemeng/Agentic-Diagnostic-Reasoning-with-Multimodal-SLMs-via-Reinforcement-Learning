                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic veins. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged.
 Widening of the superior mediastinal contour may be due to low lung volumes.
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. Hazy opacities
 are noted in the mid lung fields bilaterally, more so on the left. Small left
 pleural effusion is likely present. No pneumothorax is identified. No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hazy opacities in both mid lung fields, more so on the left and likely trace
 left pleural effusion. Findings are concerning for multifocal pneumonia
 although a component of asymmetric pulmonary edema is also likely present.
 Follow up radiographs after diuresis are recommended.
