                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure  // interval change     
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification
 of the bases with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms. This is consistent
 with bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis. Is unclear
 whether the the appearance represents worsening effusions or merely a more
 recumbent position of the patient.
 Poor definition of an engorged pulmonary vessels is consistent with the
 increased pulmonary venous pressure.
 The tip of the endotracheal tube is approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. The
 right subclavian catheter extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
