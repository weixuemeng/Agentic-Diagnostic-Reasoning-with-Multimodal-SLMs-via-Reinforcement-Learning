 brachial picc line
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the right subclavian PICC line.
 Extends to the level of the cavoatrial junction and there is no evidence of
 kinking.
 The left subclavian catheter and endotracheal tube remain in good position.
 Again there is minimal enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure. The hemidiaphragms are more sharply seen, which
 could reflect improving pleural effusions or be a manifestation of a more
 upright position of the patient.  Dense streak of atelectasis is seen in the
 left mid-zone.
