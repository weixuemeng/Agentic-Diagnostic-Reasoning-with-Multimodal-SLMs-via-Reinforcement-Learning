                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with mechnical ventillation  // please assess for
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has been removed.
 The left subclavian line and the endotracheal tube are in unchanged position. 
 Minimally improved transparency of the lung parenchyma, likely reflecting
 improved ventilation and decrease of the pre-existing parenchymal opacity
 which, however, still clearly visible, notably in the right upper lobe and at
 the bases of the left lower lobe. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged. Retrocardiac atelectasis.
