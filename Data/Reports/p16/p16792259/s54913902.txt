 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:21 AM
  Redemonstration of bibasilar opacities, again likely a combination of pleural
  fluid and atelectasis.  The heart borders are less well defined, which could
  be positional vs slight increase in these opacities.  Unchanged vascular
  congestion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure  // any interval changes
 any interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 04:41
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 19:37 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left subclavian, right PICC line and endotracheal tube are unchanged in
 position.  Lung volumes remain low with layering bilateral effusions and
 patchy bibasilar airspace disease most likely reflecting compressive
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax. No
 evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely unchanged, although patient is markedly rotated on the current study.
