                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia, intubated.  // Confirm intubation tube
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval intubation of the patient, with ET tube terminating in
 standard position approximately 5 cm above the carina. A left Port-A-Cath is
 in unchanged position with tip in the upper SVC.  Bilateral perihilar
 opacities are slightly progressed compared to the prior exam, which remain
 concerning for asymmetric pulmonary edema or multifocal pneumonia. There is no
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ET tube in standard position.
 2.  Worsening asymmetric perihilar opacities, left greater than right. This is
 most likely due to an acute process such as asymmetrical edema, multifocal
 aspiration, and or infectious pneumonia. In the absence of older radiographs
 for comparison, short-term Followup radiographs after appropriate treatment
 are recommended to exclude other subacute and chronic causes for these
 finding.
