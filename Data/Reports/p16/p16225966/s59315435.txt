                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with weakness. Evaluate for infectious process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A subpleural mass in the right upper thorax is compatible with the known
 expansile metastatic lesion arising from the second right rib seen in the
 prior CT. Based on plain films, it appears larger when compared to prior and
 there is more destruction of the second rib. A second sclerotic lesion in the
 left posterior ninth rib was also better seen on prior CT. No rib fracture is
 identified.
 
 The lungs are well-expanded. No focal opacities are identified. There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumonia.
 
 2.  Expansile metastatic lesion of the right second rib appears larger, and
 the sclerotic lesion of the posterior left ninth rib are better seen in prior
 CT.
