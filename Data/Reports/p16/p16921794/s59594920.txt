                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with STEMI ___ c/o chest pain  // acute process
 in chest
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  The patient is status post
 median sternotomy and CABG. Again, on the lateral view, there is a subtle
 rounded opacity projecting anterior to the cardiac silhouette which appears
 smaller in size and less conspicuous as compared to the prior study. However,
 as recommended on the prior study, this could be further assessed on a
 nonurgent chest CT.
