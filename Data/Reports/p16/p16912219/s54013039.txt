                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with nodule  // eval for RLL nodule
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax,
 or pulmonary edema.  The previously described right lower lobe nodule is no
 longer discretely identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Nonvisualization of the previously described 13 mm right lower lobe nodule,
 suggesting that this finding was likely secondary to the pulmonary
 vasculature.
