 INDICATION:  ___F with CP.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are moderately well inflated.  Cephalization of vasculature with
 increasing bilateral heterogeneous opacities with a right lower lobe
 predominance.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are new.  No pneumothorax. 
 There is persistent mild cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal contour and hila are
 unremarkable.
 
 Left PICC tip is seen in the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left PICC tip in mid SVC.
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema with persistent mild cardiomegaly and new small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 3. Right lower lobe opacity may represent asymmetric vascular congestion or
 consolidation.
