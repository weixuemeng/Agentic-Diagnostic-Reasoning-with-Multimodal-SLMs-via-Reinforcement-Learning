                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated, transfer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.7 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip is within the stomach.  The side port is not well assessed,
 but likely is at the GE junction.  Heart size is normal.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  Fullness of the hila is noted bilaterally.  No pulmonary edema is
 seen.  Streaky opacity within the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No displaced fractures are
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Standard position of the endotracheal tube.  Enteric tube tip within the
 stomach, but the side port is likely at the GE junction, and should be
 advanced.
 
 2.  Left basilar atelectasis.
 
 3.  Fullness of both hila, which could reflect underlying lymphadenopathy.
