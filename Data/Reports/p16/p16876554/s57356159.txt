                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate there is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiac, hilar, and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Note that lateral view is
 limited and does not include the anterior-most portion of the chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Suboptimal lateral view.
