                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of atrial fibrillation, now with
 tachycardia, fevers, chronic cough  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The aorta is tortuous with
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob.  Ascending aortic
 aneurysm is better assessed on the previous chest CT.  Hilar contours are
 normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions are
 demonstrated, new in the interval with subsegmental atelectasis seen in the
 right lung base.  14 mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule is unchanged.  No
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  Multiple clips and coils are
 noted projecting over the lower mediastinum and gastroesophageal junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumonia.
 2. Unchanged right upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
 3. Known ascending aortic aneurysm is better assessed on previous chest CT.
