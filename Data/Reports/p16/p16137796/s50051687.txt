 INDICATION:  Status post exploratory laparotomy and ___ patch over duodenal
 perforation.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect radiograph of the chest demonstrates an enteric tube
 extending below the diaphragm with the tip out of view the inferior aspect on
 image.  Lung volumes are low. Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis;
 however, infection or aspiration are possible in the correct clinical setting.
 No pneumothorax.  Small left pleural effusion.  A rounded rim calcified lesion
 in the left upper quadrant was demonstrated to be a splenic calcified lesion
 on the prior CT.
