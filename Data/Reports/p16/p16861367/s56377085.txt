                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position,
 and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Bilateral lower lobe
 predominant fibrotic lung disease appears similar to the prior radiograph, but
 there is superimposed patchy opacity at both bases, which has worsened
 compared to previous exams and is associated by accompanying volume loss. 
 This likely represents atelectasis, but aspiration or developing aspiration
 pneumonia could have a similar imaging appearance.  Curvilinear opacity
 paralleling the right hemidiaphragm contour has been present on multiple prior
 exams dating back at least to ___ and probably represents an area of
 linear basilar atelectasis adjacent to the diaphragm.  However, if warranted
 clinically, a left lateral decubitus radiograph could be considered to exclude
 the less likely possibility of a right basilar pneumothorax or free
 intraperitoneal air.
