                                 FINAL REPORT

 Please evaluate for interval change, evidence of aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is enlargement of
 cardiac silhouette with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Blunting of
 the costophrenic angles suggests bilateral small pleural effusions with
 bibasilar atelectatic changes.
 Increased opacification at the right base medially could merely reflect
 crowding of vessels related to relatively low lung volumes.  However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting it would be difficult to exclude superimposed
 pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
