                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is again noted.  Patchy opacities are
 seen in the lung bases without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  4 mm calcified nodule in the left upper lung field
 is unchanged, likely a granuloma.  There are mild degenerative changes noted
 in the thoracic spine with unchanged compression deformity at the
 thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  Infection is not completely excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.  No evidence of congestive heart failure.
