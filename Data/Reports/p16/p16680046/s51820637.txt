                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with rib fracture on ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains unfolded.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise within normal limits.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  Lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Moderate degenerative changes are seen
 within the imaged thoracolumbar spine with posterior fusion hardware in the
 upper lumbar spine incompletely imaged.  Minimal cortical irregularity of the
 left twelfth rib reflects the findings seen on recent CT and is suggestive of
 a possible acute fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Mild cortical irregularity of the left
 twelfth rib again may reflect a possible acute fracture.
