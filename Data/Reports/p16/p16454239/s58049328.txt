                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left chest wall pain after a fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Apparent
 opacification at the right cardiophrenic angle is likely due to mild pectus
 excavatum.  Suture material is seen at the left mid lung and left lung base. 
 Slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm suggests volume loss. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 identified.  Deformities of the left sixth and seventh ribs are chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
