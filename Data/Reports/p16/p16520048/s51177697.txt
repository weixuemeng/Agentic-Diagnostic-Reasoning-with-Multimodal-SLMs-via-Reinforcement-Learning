                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is a vague
 opacity projecting just above the right hemidiaphragm in the right lung base
 on the frontal projection, which could represent an abnormality in the breast
 or chest wall, though the possibility of a nodule in the right lower lung is
 not excluded.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears within normal limits.  The imaged bony structures are
 intact with degenerative changes noted at the right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle nodular opacity projecting over the right lung base on the
 frontal projection, may represent overlapping structures in the body wall,
 though true nodule not excluded.  Consider dedicated chest CT to further
 assess.
