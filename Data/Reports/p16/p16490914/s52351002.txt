 INDICATION:  Right lateral rib pain, status post fall earlier today.  Tender
 to palpation along the third/fourth rib along the axilla.  Evaluate for
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The lungs
 are clear.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The bony thorax is grossly
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  No definite rib fracture identified.  If there is persistent concern for
 rib fracture, dedicated rib series with a skin marker at the site of the
 patient's pain could be obtained.
