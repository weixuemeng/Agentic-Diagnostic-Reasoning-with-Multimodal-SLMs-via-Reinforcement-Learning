                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with persistent cough.  Rales at the left base.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 The patient has had median sternotomy and coronary bypass grafting.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly has not changed appreciably since ___.  There is no pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusion, or focal abnormality in the left lower lobe.  Both
 hila are bulkier than they were in ___, but I think this is due to vascular
 engorgement involving both pulmonary arteries and veins.  The confluence of
 the right lung veins and left atrium is particularly bulbous.  If symptoms
 persist, it may be necessary to examine the lungs and bronchi with CT
 scanning, but this study suggests no specific abnormality.
