                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with a past medical history of afib on Coumadin, sCHF (EF
 ___%) s/p ICD in ___, HTN, CAD, DM2, and COPD who presents with cough,
 dyspnea now with new dyspnea  // evaluate for infiltrate vs. effusion vs
 congestion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left chest wall single lead pacing device is unchanged in appearance
 compared to the prior study.  The thoracic aorta demonstrates moderate
 unfolding.  This accounts for at least some of the widening of the
 mediastinum.  This is also likely exaggerated by the technique.  No
 consolidation seen.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm is unchanged compared to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Technically limited study.  No acute cardiopulmonary process seen.
