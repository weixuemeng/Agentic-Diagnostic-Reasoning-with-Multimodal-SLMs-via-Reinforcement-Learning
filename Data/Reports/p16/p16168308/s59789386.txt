 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with a PMH of afib on Coumadin, sCHF (EF ___%) s/p ICD in
 ___, HTN, CAD, DM2, and COPD requiring home O2 presents with cough, dyspnea

 single lead left-sided pacemaker present, with lead tip over right ventricle,
 not significantly changed.  Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter, tip overlying main
 pulmonary artery, a retracted compared with the prior study. Again seen is
 cardiomegaly, with sternotomy wires.  There is upper zone redistribution and
 mild vascular plethora, minimally improved.  There is atelectasis at both lung
 bases, slightly improved in retrocardiac region. Otherwise, no focal opacity. 
 No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Cardiomegaly, similar to prior.
 Repositioning of Swan-Ganz catheter, with tip now overlying main pulmonary

 Retrocardiac opacity is slightly improved.  Right cardiophrenic patchy
 opacity, question atelectasis, is unchanged.  No new infiltrate identified.
 Upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora is minimally improved.
