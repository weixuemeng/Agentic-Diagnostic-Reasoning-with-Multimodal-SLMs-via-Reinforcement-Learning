                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known hepatitis, coronary artery disease, and hypertension
 presenting with abdominal and chest pain.  Evaluate for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion, with
 portions of it loculated laterally.  Fluid is also seen layering along the
 major and minor fissures.  There is no left pleural effusion.  Focal
 opacification at the right base is likely associated atelectasis.  There is no
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-sized partially loculated right pleural effusion with
 associated atelectasis.
