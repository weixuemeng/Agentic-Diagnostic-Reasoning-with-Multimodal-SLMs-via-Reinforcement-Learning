                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man post chest tube removal  // Pneumothorax,
 effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, a moderate sized right basilar
 pneumothorax has predominantly filled with fluid resulting in a hydro
 pneumothorax. A small right apical pneumothorax is also evident. A large mass
 surrounds the right hilar region and is associated with postobstructive
 atelectasis involving the right middle and right lower lobes. New patchy and
 linear opacities in the left lung base likely reflect atelectasis and less
 likely aspiration. Poorly defined nodules throughout the left lung have been
 more fully evaluated by a outside chest CT ___.
