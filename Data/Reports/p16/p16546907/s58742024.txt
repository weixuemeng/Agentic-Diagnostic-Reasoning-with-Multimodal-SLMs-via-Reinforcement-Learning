                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MPE 500cc removed right  // ___ ___     
 ___ ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Following thoracentesis, there is still a substantial amount of opacification
 involving the right mid and lower zones, but no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 opacification is consistent with some combination of ___ obstructive
 atelectasis and pneumonia related to the large right hilar mass, as well as
 residual right pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper
 limits of normal in size and there are prominent opacifications in the left
 lung that are consistent with nodules seen on CT. Some degree of vascular
 congestion may also be present.
