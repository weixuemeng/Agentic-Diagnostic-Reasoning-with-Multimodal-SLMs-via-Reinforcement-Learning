                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M without known PMH presents after fall with L pathologic hip
 fracture, found to have R hilar mass with post-obstructive lobar collapse and
 multiple foci of likely metastasis in the lungs and vertebral bodies, now s/p
 chest tube placement and ORIF of L subtrochanteric fracture.  // Interval
 assessment after chest tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ thin from ___.
 Targeted review of chest CT from ___ from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A chest tube overlies the lower right lung. A relatively large pneumothorax is
 seen at the right lung base. There is increased opacity in the retracted right
 lung base and perihilar region. The right upper lung appears relatively clear.
 Probable mild rightward shift of the mediastinum.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly without unfolded aorta. The left hilum is
 prominent, with a tapered appearance, which could reflect the presence of
 pulmonary hypertension.
 
 There is minimal atelectasis or scarring at the left lung base. There is mi
 prominence of the interstitial markings in the left lung. Abnormalities in the
 left lung, which include increased interstitial markings and multiple small
 nodular opacities, are more completely demonstrated on the outside CT scan.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right chest tube in place. Relatively large pneumothorax at right lung
 base. Slight rightward shift of mediastinum noted
 2. Retracted/atelectatic right lung, with increased opacity in the right lung
 base and perihilar region. This appearance is more completely demonstrated on
 the recent outside CT scan.
 3. Prominence of the left pulmonary hilum raises question of pulmonary
 hypertension.
 4. Subtle increased interstitial markings and nodular densities in the left
 lung, more completely visualized on outside CT from ___ day earlier.
 
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Finding of a right base pneumothorax was paged to the covering
 house officer Dr. ___ at the time of discovery at 12:57 pm and
 discussed with am by phone at approximately 8 14:00 on ___.
