                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/COPD, p/w acute dyspnea, right-sided rhonchi, bibasilar
 crackles, please eval for pna  // ___F w/COPD, p/w acute dyspnea, right-sided
 rhonchi, bibasilar crackles, please eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions which appear somewhat increased
 as compared to the prior study, with overlying atelectasis. Bibasilar
 opacities are most likely due to combination of pleural effusions and
 atelectasis, but underlying consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis, appear
 slightly increased as compared to the prior study.
