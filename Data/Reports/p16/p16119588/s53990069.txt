                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with with COPD presents with cough, sputum
 production, increased shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal contour is within normal
 limits.  Enlargement of both hilar regions is compatible with underlying
 pulmonary arterial dilatation.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Severe
 emphysema is present with hyperinflation of the lungs.  Small left pleural
 effusion is unchanged and trace right pleural effusion appear slightly
 increased in the interval.  Nodular opacities within both upper lobes appear
 grossly unchanged, and better characterized on the recent CT.  Patchy right
 basilar opacity and consolidation in the left lower lobe are not substantially
 changed in the interval.  Pneumothorax is detected.  Compression deformity
 within a mid thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent opacities in the lung bases concerning for pneumonia or
 aspiration with continued atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
 2. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  Trace right pleural effusion is
 minimally increased.
 3. Nodular opacities in both upper lobes are relatively unchanged and
 previously characterized on the recent CT.
 4. Severe emphysema with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
