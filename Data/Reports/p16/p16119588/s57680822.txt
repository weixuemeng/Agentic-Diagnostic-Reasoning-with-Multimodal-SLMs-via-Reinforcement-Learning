                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with right lower lobe crackles, o2 desat  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prior left PICC is no longer visualized. There are persistent bilateral
 effusions, moderate on the left and a small on the right, similar to prior.
 Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs are likely due to chronic
 underlying interstitial process. Peripheral patchy opacities are also
 visualized, right greater than left and are in a similar distribution to
 nodular opacities seen on prior CT. Mild cardiomegaly is again noted.
 Compression deformity of an upper thoracic vertebral body level was seen on
 prior but has likely progressed since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent moderate left and small right pleural effusions.
 Peripheral patchily opacities in a similar distribution to nodules better seen
 on prior chest CT. Followup imaging by CT had been suggested at that time and
 should still be performed on a nonurgent basis.
