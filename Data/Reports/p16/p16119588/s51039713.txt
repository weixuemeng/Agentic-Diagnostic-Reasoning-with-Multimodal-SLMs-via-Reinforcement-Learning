                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with history of severe COPD with newly
 developed cough and acute onset shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs remain hyperinflated with flattened diaphragms and extensive
 emphysematous changes again noted. The heart size is normal. Enlargement of
 the pulmonary arteries bilaterally is re- demonstrated suggestive of
 underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. Mediastinal contour is unchanged.
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 demonstrated, mildly increased in size on the right since the prior study.
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.
 Multiple pulmonary nodules seen on prior chest CT are not as well demonstrated
 on the current exam. No pneumothorax or new focal consolidation is present.
 Mild loss of height of a mid thoracic vertebral body is similar.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe emphysema with mild bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural
 effusions, slightly increased in size on the right compared to prior. 
 Enlarged pulmonary arteries suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  No new focal consolidation.
