 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to prior, there has been no significant interval change.  There

 interstitial markings in combination with hyperinflation are compatible with
 underlying emphysema.  Mild cardiac enlargement is stable.  Vertebral body
 height loss noted in the thoracic spine but not particularly well assessed on
 the current exam due to osteopenia and technique.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent small left pleural effusion.  No definite superimposed acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
