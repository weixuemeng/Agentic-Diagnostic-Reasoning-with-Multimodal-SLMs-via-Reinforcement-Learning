                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate low lung
 volumes which limit evaluation.  Allowing for this, lungs appear clear without
 focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears within normal limits.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below
 the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  Limited exam due to low lung
 volumes.
