 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Mild patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is

 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis, but no focal consolidation
 to suggest pneumonia.
