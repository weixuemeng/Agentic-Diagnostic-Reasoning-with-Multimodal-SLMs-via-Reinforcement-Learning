                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Apparent widening of
 the mediastinal structures is likely due to low lung volumes.  Old left-sided
 rib cage deformity is re- demonstrated as is an old right distal clavicular
 fracture and widening of the right acromioclavicular joint.  There is crowding
 of the bronchovascular structures.  There may be chronic blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle suggestive of pleural thickening although a trace effusion
 is not excluded.  Retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis but infection
 is not excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Possible patchy retrocardiac opacity reflecting atelectasis
 but infection is not excluded.  Remote osseous deformities of the thorax and
 right AC joint separation likely from prior trauma.
