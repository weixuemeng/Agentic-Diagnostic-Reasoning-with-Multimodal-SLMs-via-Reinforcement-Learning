                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with bizarre behavior, tachycardic.  Evaluate
 for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Of
 note, the evaluation of the upper mediastinum is limited by external artifact.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. If there are
 concerns about upper mediastinal pathologies such as thyromegaly, a new
 frontal view might be pursued for further assessment.
