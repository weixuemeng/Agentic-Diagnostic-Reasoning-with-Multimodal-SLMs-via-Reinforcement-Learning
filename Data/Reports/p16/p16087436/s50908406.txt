                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post subarachnoid hemorrhage and coiling, respiratory
 failure, pneumonia, to look for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiographs, with the most recent from ___.
 
 FIDINGS: There are no significant interval changes in the lungs since ___.  Very mild pulmonary edema is similar.  Previously appreciated discrete
 opacity in the left lower lung adjacent to the descending thoracic aorta,
 which was presumably a part of the thoracic aortic shadow is no more
 appreciated on the current radiograph. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 6.4 cm above the carina
 and is adequately positioned.  Left-sided PICC line tip ends at mid SVC.  A
 feeding tube courses below the diaphragm and ends into the stomach; however,
 the distal end is off the radiograph view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Very mild pulmonary edema unchanged since ___.
