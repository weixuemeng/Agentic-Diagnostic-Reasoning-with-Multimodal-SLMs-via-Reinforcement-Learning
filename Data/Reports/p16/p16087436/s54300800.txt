                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  To look for the position of Dobbhoff tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright chest view was read in comparison with
 prior chest radiograph from ___, done approximately 10 hours apart.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Tip of the endotracheal ends 6.2 cm above the carina, left-sided PICC line tip
 is at mid SVC.  The orogastric tube and a feeding tube courses below the
 diaphragm, however, the distal end is off the radiographic view.  A repeat
 radiograph is suggested for further evaluation covering the upper abdomen to
 assess further position of the orogastric and feeding tube.  Mild and diffuse
 bilateral opacities, more on the right side, reflecting asymmetric pulmonary
 edema is very insignificantly changed since last 10 hours.  Heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Feeding tube and orogastric tube can be traced just below the
 diaphragm but beyond that, they are off the radiograph view and hence their
 position could not be reliably assessed.  Repeat radiograph including the
 upper abdomen is recommended for further evaluation.
