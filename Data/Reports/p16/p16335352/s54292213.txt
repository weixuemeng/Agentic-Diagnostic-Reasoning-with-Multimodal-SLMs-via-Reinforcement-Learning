                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intubation, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the areas of atelectasis at
 the right lung bases are slightly more extensive than on the previous image. 
 Otherwise, there is no relevant change.  No newly appeared parenchymal
 opacities suggestive of pneumonia.  The monitoring and support devices are in
 constant position.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema or
 pleural effusions.
