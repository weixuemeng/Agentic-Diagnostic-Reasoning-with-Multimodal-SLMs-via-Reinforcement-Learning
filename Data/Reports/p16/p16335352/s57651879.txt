                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cirrhosis, on transplant list, who presents with fever
 and chills.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Left base atelectasis is seen.  On the lateral view, there appears
 to be prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.  Possible lower lobe opacity on
 the lateral view not substantiated on the frontal view may be due to overlap
 of vascular structures or in the appropriate clinical setting, an early
 consolidation would not be excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal. Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.
