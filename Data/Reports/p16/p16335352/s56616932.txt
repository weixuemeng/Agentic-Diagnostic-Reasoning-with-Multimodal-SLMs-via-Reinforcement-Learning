                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with ethanol cirrhosis, esophageal varices status
 post TIPS presenting with hematemesis.  Study requested for confirmation of OG
 tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates 4.9 cm above the carina.  An
 enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, the tip is not included in this
 examination. There is mild distension of the upper stomach.  Mild cardiomegaly
 remains unchanged since ___.  Low lung volumes accentuate the
 bronchovascular structures. Increased opacity at the left lung base could be
 related to a small amount of pleural fluid or could represent a more focal
 finding, such as early developing pneumonia.  There is engorgement of the
 mediastinal veins.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, tip not included in this
 examination. 
 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly with engorgement of mediastinal veins and no pulmonary
 edema.
 
 3.  Increased opacity at left lung base could be related to pleural fluid or
 early developing pneumonia. Close follow up is recommended.
