                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tracheal stenosis versus post-intubation edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, again some
 narrowing of the trachea projected just above the level of the clavicles. 
 Again, this could reflect post-intubation edema following extubation or
 intrinsic stenosis.  Otherwise, little change.
