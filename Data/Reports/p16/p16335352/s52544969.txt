  1. Persistent retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis however
  pneumonia would be similar in appearance and clinical correlation is
  recommended.
  2.  Hypoinflated lungs with crowding of vasculature.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with weakness.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views the chest provided.  Lung volumes are low limiting
 assessment.  Cardiomegaly is mild.  Bronchovascular crowding likely accounts
 for subtle lower lung opacities on the frontal radiograph.  Multiple metallic
 coils are again noted in the upper abdomen.  No convincing evidence for
 pneumonia or edema.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contour
 is normal.  Mild hilar congestion difficult to exclude in the correct clinical
 setting.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam given low lung volumes.  Mild cardiomegaly with lower lung
 bronchovascular crowding.  Possible mild hilar congestion.
