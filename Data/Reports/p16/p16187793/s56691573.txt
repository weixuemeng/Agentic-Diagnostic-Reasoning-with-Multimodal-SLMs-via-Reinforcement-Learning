                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p direct TAVI  // eval for effusion or
 infiltrate      eval for effusion or infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___
 through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetric edema developed following repeat sternotomy between ___ and
 ___.  The process improved slowly over the next 2 days, and the
 caliber of the postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette decreased.  .  Today
 there is an increase in several foci of abnormality in the previously
 edematous right lung.  This is more likely pneumonia than should be ascribed
 to the return of edema alone, since the pattern of distribution is quite
 different.  There is ild interstitial edema more easily recognizable in the
 left lung, but this is unchanged since ___.
 
 I note the esophagus is a generally distended with air which may indicate a
 tendency to reflux and aspirate.  There is no appreciable atelectasis and
 little if any pleural effusion.
