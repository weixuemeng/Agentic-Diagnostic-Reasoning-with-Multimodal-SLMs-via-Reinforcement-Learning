                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe AS, CAD s/p CABG, CHF EF ___%,
 previously admitted for PNA with recent admission for NSTEMI ___ p/w C/P,
 troponinemia, elevated BNP with bloody sputum and leukocytosis  // Evaluation
 of pulmonary edema and/or evolution of PNA    Evaluation of pulmonary edema
 and/or evolution of PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rapid improvement in the widespread upper lobe predominant pulmonary
 opacification over half a day indicates that a large component is due to
 pulmonary edema.  Patient has emphysema and possibly diffuse infiltrative lung
 disease which contribute to the heterogeneous appearance of the abnormality. 
 It would be difficult to recognize concurrent pneumonia, particularly in the
 right upper lobe which has been the region of greatest consolidation.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly unchanged.  Pleural effusions are small, probably
 incidental.  There is no pneumothorax.  The upper esophagus is consistently
 air-filled, probably a functional abnormality.
