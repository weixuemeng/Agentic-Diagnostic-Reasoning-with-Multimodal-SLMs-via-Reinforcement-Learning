                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  An endotracheal tube
 terminates 5.6 cm above the carina.  There is no pneumothorax. The previously
 seen right basilar opacity appears more veil-like on the current supine
 examination, and may represent an effusion. Persistent left retrocardiac
 opacity likely reflects atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent right basilar opacity is less defined on this supine
 radiograph, and may reflect pleural effusion rather than focal consolidation.
 2.  Unchanged left retrocardiac opacity.
