                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Back pain, leukocytosis, evaluation for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  The sternal wires, one of
 which is ruptured, and the clips after CABG are constant in appearance.  There
 is evidence of minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema is present
 on the current image.  No pleural effusions.  Minimal atelectasis in the
 retrocardiac lung regions, unchanged as compared to the previous image.
