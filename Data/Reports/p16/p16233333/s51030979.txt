                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and well-aerated lungs without pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Mildly increased opacity in the right lower lung could
 represent atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded in the right clinical
 setting.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mildly increased opacity in the right lower lung could represent atelectasis,
 but infection cannot be excluded in the right clinical setting.
