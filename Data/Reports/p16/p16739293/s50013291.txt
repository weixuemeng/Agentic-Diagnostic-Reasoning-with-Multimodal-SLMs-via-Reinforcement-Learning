                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman, a smoker, with a cough for three weeks and some
 hemoptysis.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
 
 Generally, the lungs are hyperinflated suggesting small airway obstruction or
 emphysema.  Lung apices are hyperlucent but a CT scan in ___ did not show
 emphysema elsewhere in the imaged portion of the lungs. A small region of
 heterogeneous lung in the left lower lobe or lingula is new.  There is a small
 component of atelectasis reflected retraction of the left hemidiaphragm.  This
 could be the residual of pneumonia or atelectasis due to retained secretions. 
 I recommend repeat chest radiographs in four to six weeks to see if there are
 any residual findings warranting further investigation with a chest CT scan.
