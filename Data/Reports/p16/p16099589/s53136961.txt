                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with erythrodermic rash but recent asthma
 exacerbation and fever  // evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are remarkable for a
 left cardiophrenic angle opacity, most likely due to a prominent pericardial
 fat pad and less likely a cyst or lipoma.  . The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal. Lungs are hyperexpanded, consistent with history of asthma.  Lungs are
 clear except for focal linear scar or atelectasis in the lingula.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
 
 2.  Left cardiophrenic angle opacity is most likely due to a prominent
 pericardial fat pad.  Direct comparison to older radiographs would be helpful
 to document stability.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If prior radiographs cannot be procured to to document
 stability of left cardiophrenic angle opacity,, consider followup chest
 radiograph in ___ months to document stability or CT to further characterize
 this region.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 08:00 into the Department of Radiology
 critical communications system for direct communication to the referring
