                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient status post right internal jugular
 hemodialysis line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new right internal jugular central venous catheter with
 the tip in the mid SVC.  There is no evidence of associated pneumothorax. 
 Endotracheal tube tip remains in the mid trachea.  An enteric tube is
 visualized with the tip in the stomach.  The heart is normal in size. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are again noted at the aortic arch.  Blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle is again noted, suggestive of a small effusion
 or perhaps chronic scarring.  Moderate relative elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is again noted without any focal consolidation.
 
 Increased opacifcation at the right bse medially. This raises the possibility
 of a developing pneuimonia 
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right internal jugular central venous catheter with the tip
 in the mid SVC.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Possible developing right base
 pneumonia.
