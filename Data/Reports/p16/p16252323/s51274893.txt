                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation.  Question placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable semi-AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 7 cm above the carina near the thoracic inlet.  An orogastric
 tube enters the stomach, where it makes a single coil.  The heart is normal in
 size.  There is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The aortic arch is
 calcified.  There is flattening of the left costophrenic angle suggesting
 there may be a small pleural effusion or perhaps chronic scarring or
 plate-like atelectasis at this site.  Moderate relative elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is noted with streaky opacities at the right lung base
 suggesting minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.
 
 2.  Endotracheal tube terminating approximately 7 cm above the carina.  If
 clinically indicated, advancing the tube by 2-3 cm could be considered for
 more optimal positioning.
 
 3.  Moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
