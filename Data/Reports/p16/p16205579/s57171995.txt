                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath, history of breast cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Patchy areas of opacity projecting over the left mid to lower hemithorax are
 concerning for infection and/or malignant involvement.  The osseous structures
 are heterogeneous, including areas of bilateral ribs (is for example the
 anterior right 8th rib.  The anterior ribs on the lateral seen.  Increased
 sclerosis projecting over a lower thoracic vertebral body also raises concern
 for metastatic involvement.  No large pleural effusion is seen although trace
 pleural effusion be difficult to exclude.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary
 edema is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Osseous metastatic disease.  Patchy opacities projecting over the left mid to
 lower hemi thorax, while in part may relate to osseous metastatic disease,
 raise concern for infection and/or pulmonary metastatic disease.
