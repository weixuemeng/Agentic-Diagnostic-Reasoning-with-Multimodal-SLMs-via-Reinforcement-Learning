                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  Aorta is
 tortuous.  Lung volumes have improved compared to the prior study, and
 previously present area of opacity in the left lower lobe has markedly
 improved with only minimal residual atelectasis remaining.  Small left pleural
 effusion has also slightly decreased in size.  Right hemidiaphragm remains
 minimally elevated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rapidly clearing left lower lobe opacity, which may have
 represented atelectasis or aspiration, with adjacent improving small left
 pleural effusion.
