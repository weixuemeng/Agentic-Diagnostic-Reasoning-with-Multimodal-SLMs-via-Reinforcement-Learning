                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral crackles at lung bases with fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The lungs are well expanded and clear.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Fullness in the region of the azygos vein is seen without
 overt pulmonary edema but a component of lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded. 
 The heart is normal in size and otherwise mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process. Fullness along the right
 paratracheal stripe could be vascular or reflect lymphadenopathy. Suggest
 non-emergent Chest CT.
