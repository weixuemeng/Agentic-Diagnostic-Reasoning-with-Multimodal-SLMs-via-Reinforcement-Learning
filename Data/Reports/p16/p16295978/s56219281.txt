                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HFrEF and crackles on exam  // Pulm edema?  
 Pulm edema?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels
 consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Again there are bilateral
 pleural effusions, more prominent on the left, with associated compressive
 basilar atelectasis.
 Although no definite focal consolidation is appreciated on this single frontal
 view, given the changes in the lungs it would be very difficult to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the
 absence of a lateral view.
