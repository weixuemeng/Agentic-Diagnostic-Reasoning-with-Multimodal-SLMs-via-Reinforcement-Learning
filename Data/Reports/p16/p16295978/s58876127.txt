                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with tachypnea  // PNA vs edema      PNA vs edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with indistinctness of pulmonary vessels
 consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Probable small bilateral
 pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases, more prominent on
 the left.
 No definite focal pneumonia, though this would be difficult to exclude in the
 appropriate clinical setting given the size of the heart and pulmonary
 vascular congestion, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
