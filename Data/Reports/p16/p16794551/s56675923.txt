                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, lethargic, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 marked kyphotic angulation of the T-spine, which limits the evaluation through
 the lower lungs, though allowing for this, there is interval development of
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusions are seen.  A subtle
 density at the left lung base could represent scar atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Bones appear diffusely demineralized.  A right humeral
 neck fracture is redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval development of interstitial pulmonary edema.
 2.  Right humeral neck fracture again seen.
