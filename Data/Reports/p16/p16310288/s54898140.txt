                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with abdominal pain and
 suspected left lower lobe pneumonia versus atelectasis.

 ___.
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinum is stable in
 appearance.  Post-sternotomy wires in the patient after CABG are noted.  No
 pleural effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax is present.  Current examination
 demonstrates no definitive evidence of consolidation to suggest pneumonia. 
 Minimal atelectasis most likely of the right middle lobe is present on the
