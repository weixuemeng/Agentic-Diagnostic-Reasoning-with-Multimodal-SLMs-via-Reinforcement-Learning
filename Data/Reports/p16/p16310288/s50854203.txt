                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumosepsis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary bypass surgery.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  A patchy but extensive opacity
 in the left upper lobe suggesting pneumonia has improved to some extent.  The
 right lung remains clear.  There is perhaps a trace pleural effusion on the
 left, but no definite right-sided effusion.  There is a moderate hiatal
 hernia.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement in left upper lobe consolidation.  Follow-up
 radiographs within eight weeks are recommended to show resolution.
