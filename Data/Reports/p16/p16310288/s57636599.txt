 PORTABLE CHEST DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and accompanied by pulmonary
 vascular congestion and asymmetrical right perihilar opacities as well as
 bilateral peripheral interstitial abnormality.  Observed findings most likely
 represent asymmetrical pulmonary edema, but followup radiograph after diuresis
 would be helpful to ensure resolution and to exclude other process in the
 right lung such as infection or aspiration.  Bilateral small pleural effusions
 are also evident as well as a linear focus of atelectasis at the right base.
