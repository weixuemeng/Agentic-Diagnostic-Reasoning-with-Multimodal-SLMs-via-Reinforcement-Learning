                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Injury, unwitnessed fall, trauma to forehead.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP upright and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Retrocardiac opacity seen on the lateral views, not well substantiated on the
 frontal view, may be due to overlapping structures or atelectasis, however
 underlying consolidation is not entirely excluded.  The posterior left
 costophrenic angle is not well seen and a trace pleural effusion is not
 excluded.  The cardiac mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No displaced
 fracture is seen.
