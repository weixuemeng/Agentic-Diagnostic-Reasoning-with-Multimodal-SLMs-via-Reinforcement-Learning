 evaluate for interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 4:04 am.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi supine chest film ___ at 04:30 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip 4 cm above the carina.  A right internal jugular
 central line has its tip in the mid to distal SVC.  A nasogastric tube is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Interval reduction
 in lung volumes with appearance of patchy bibasilar opacities most likely
 representing atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be
 considered.  There is possibly a layering left effusion.  Crowding of the
 pulmonary vasculature with no overt pulmonary edema.  No large pneumothorax is
 appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished
 given semi-supine technique.
