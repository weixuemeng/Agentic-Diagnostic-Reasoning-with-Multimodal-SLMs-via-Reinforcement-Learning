                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  In the heterogeneous consolidation largely confined to the left
 upper lobe are several horizontal interfaces, probably fluid levels in areas
 of cavitation. The differential diagnosis of multiple cavities in a region of
 pneumonia includes necrotizing pneumonia due to bacterial pathogens,
 particularly when aspiration is the source, as well as primary progressive
 tuberculous pneumonia. This differential diagnosis and the findings were
 discussed by telephone with ___ at 1:25 p.m., ___.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  fever chills hemoptysis productive cough decreased airflow  //
 pls eval for pna      pls eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no prior chest radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New heterogeneous consolidation in the left lung is largely confined to the
 upper lobe suggesting that it is not due to blood aspirated to that location
 but instead is possibly the source of hemoptysis.  Right lung is clear.  Heart
 size normal.  No pleural abnormality or strong evidence for central
 adenopathy.  Nevertheless CT scanning might be very helpful in characterizing
 the full extent of this lesion.
