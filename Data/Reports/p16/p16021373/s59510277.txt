                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hip surgery ___, now with hypoxia.  //
 ?Pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  Probable mild
 cardiomegaly.  The aorta is calcified an minimally unfolded. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise within normal limits.
 
 No CHF or pleural effusion is identified.
 
 Minimal retrocardiac opacity is noted-- this is compatible with atelectasis,
 but an early infectious infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.  Minimal
 subsegmental atelectasis at the right base.
 
 Deformity of both humeral heads is compatible with severe glenohumeral
 osteoarthritis, possibly with associated humeral head osteonecrosis.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bibasilar atelectasis.  The possibility of an early pneumonic infiltrate at
 the left base cannot be entirely excluded.
 2. Background COPD and mild cardiomegaly, without CHF.
 3. Bilateral glenohumeral osteoarthritis, with possible associated humeral
 head osteonecrosis.
