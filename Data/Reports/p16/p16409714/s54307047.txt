                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with right lower lobe
 nodule after right lower lobe lobectomy.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to multiple prior
 examinations with the chest CT obtained the same day earlier.
 
 The patient is after one lung intubation with the ET tube tip being in the
 left main bronchus, most likely reflecting selective intubation.  The right
 chest tube is in place.  The air collection in the right apex is related to
 prior surgery but should be closely followed.  Bibasal areas of atelectasis
 are expected.  Sutures in the left upper lobe are reflecting prior left upper
 lobe surgery.
