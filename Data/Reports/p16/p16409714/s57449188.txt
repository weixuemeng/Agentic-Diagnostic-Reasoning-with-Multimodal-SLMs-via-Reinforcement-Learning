 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion  // ? pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are very low, exaggerating heart size and bronchovascular
 markings.  Interstitial prominence is nonspecific and may represent mild
 edema. Retrocardiac opacity is new and may represent infection, aspiration, or
 atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Left upper and right
 lower lung chain sutures are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial prominence is nonspecific and may be related to low lung
 volumes or mild edema. Retrocardiac opacity is also nonspecific and may
 represent infection, atelectasis, or aspiration. Dedicated PA and lateral
 views would be helpful if the patient is able.
