 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Generalized weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly-to-moderately enlarged.  There is a new hazy
 bilateral lung opacification with indistinct pulmonary vascularity, most
 consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative changes involve each shoulder
 including effacement of the right acromiohumeral interval, which may relate to
 rotator cuff pathology.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
