                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness  // pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. Aortic knob is calcified. Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits. Pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 Somewhat triangular opacity measuring 7 mm projecting over the right upper
 lobe in the region of the fifth posterior rib could reflect a confluence of
 shadows. The Lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.  7 mm triangular opacity projecting
 over the right upper lobe, at the level of the right fifth rib posteriorly
 could reflect a confluence of shadows, but can be further assessed with
 shallow oblique imaging.
