                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated post-exploratory laparotomy  // ETT
 placement? Interval change in lung fields?      ETT placement? Interval change
 in lung fields?
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are substantially lower today despite new intubation, ET tube in
 standard placement.  Poor definition of the airway lumens is not a new
 finding, but does raise concern for retained secretions, and there is
 considerable new atelectasis at both lung bases, left greater than right. 
 Pleural effusions small if any.  No pneumothorax.  Severe cardiomegaly is
 exaggerated by lower lung volumes.  Right PIC line ends low in the right
 atrium.  Nasogastric drainage tube ends in the upper portion of a nondistended
 stomach.
