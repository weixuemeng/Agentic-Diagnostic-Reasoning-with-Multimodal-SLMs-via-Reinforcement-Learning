 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval change. 
 Again there are low lung volumes that accentuate the enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette.  The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion is mild.

 The nasogastric tube extends into the stomach with the side port distal to the
 esophagogastric junction.  There is a E tube or wire coiling over the lower
