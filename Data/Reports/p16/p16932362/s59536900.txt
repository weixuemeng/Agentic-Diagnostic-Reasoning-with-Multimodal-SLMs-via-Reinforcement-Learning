                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PTX s/p chest tube  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dated from ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right pneumothorax with associated subcutaneous gas is again seen, though
 there appears to be interval improvement of the upper lung portion.  Right
 lower lobe opacity persists which is likely a combination of atelectasis and
 superimposed pneumonia.  The small right pleural effusion remains grossly
 unchanged.  The right apical chest tube is unchanged in position.  The small
 left pleural effusion has not changed, otherwise the left lung is clear.  A
 feeding tube is again seen and remains unchanged position.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette has a leftward shift secondary to severe
 thoracolumbar scoliosis and is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right pneumothorax improved in the upper lung, with persistent opacity of
 the right lower lobe, likely combination of atelectasis and superimposed
 pneumonia.
 2. Stable bilateral small pleural effusions.
