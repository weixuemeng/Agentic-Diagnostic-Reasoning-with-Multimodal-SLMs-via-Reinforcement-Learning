                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with right PTX, increased pain and sanginous
 output from chest tube evaluate for interval change in PTX, chest tube
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been significant interval increase in the right apical pneumothorax,
 now moderate to large.  There is associated increased density in the right
 lung, likely attributable to progressive collapse.  There is no definite
 air-fluid level.  The right chest tube is in grossly unchanged position,
 deviated medially slightly by the collapsed lung.  A trace left pleural
 effusion is unchanged, the left lung is otherwise clear.  Allowing for
 rotation there is likely minimal rightward mediastinal shift.  Right chest
 wall subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged.  A Dobhoff tube terminates within
 the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in the right apical pneumothorax, now moderate to large with
 associated progressed right lung collapse.
