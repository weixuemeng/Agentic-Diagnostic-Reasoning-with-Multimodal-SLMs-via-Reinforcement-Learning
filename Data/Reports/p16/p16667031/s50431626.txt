 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male intubated, please assess ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube resides within the left main stem bronchus,
 advanced compared with ___.  Right IJ, and left subclavian central venous

 There is chronic right upper lobe collapse. Predominantly central airspace
 opacity has progressed compared with prior, there is no pleural effusion, the
 cardiac silhouette remains normal in size, the mediastinal contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of endotracheal tube in the left main stem bronchus, no
 right main component is seen.  There is chronic right upper lobe collapse.
 
 2.  Confluent predominantly central airspace opacity, consistent with this
 patient's history of hemoptysis.
