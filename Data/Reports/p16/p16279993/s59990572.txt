 EXAM:  CHEST FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There
 is thickening of the right  paratracheal stripe which may be due to prominent
 vasculature, although underlying lymphadenopathy is not excluded, and further
 evaluation with non-urgent chest CT (assuming no concern for acute aortic
 syndrome) advised.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominent right mediastinal soft tissue while could relate to
 vasculature, underlying lymphadenopathy or other soft tissue not excluded. 
 Recommend further evaluation with CT.
