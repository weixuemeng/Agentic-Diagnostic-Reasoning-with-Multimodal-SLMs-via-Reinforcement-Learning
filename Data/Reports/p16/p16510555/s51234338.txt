 abnormalities
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the asymmetric opacification in the
 left mid zone has essentially cleared.  Again there is hyperexpansion of the
 lungs with flattening hemidiaphragms consistent with chronic pulmonary
 disease.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without vascular congestion,
 raises the possibility of underlying cardiomyopathy.  No evidence of acute
 focal pneumonia.
