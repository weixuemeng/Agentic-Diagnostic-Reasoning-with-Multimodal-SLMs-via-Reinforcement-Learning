                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ 
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Bilateral hilar prominence is present, and
 could reflect accentuation of pulmonary vessels by relatively low lung volumes
 or hilar lymph node enlargement.  Lungs and pleural surfaces are clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
 
 2.  Bilateral hilar prominence, for which a repeat chest radiograph with
 improved inspiratory level is recommended to help differentiate prominent
 pulmonary vessels from bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.  Findings and
 recommendation entered into radiology communications dashboard on ___.
