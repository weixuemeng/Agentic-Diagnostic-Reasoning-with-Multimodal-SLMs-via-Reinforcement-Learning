                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dry cough with smoking history and multiple previous right
 pneumonias.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. 
 There is some hyperexpansion of the lungs raising the possibility of chronic
 pulmonary disease.  An area of asymmetric opacification is again seen at the
 right base, which could reflect some old fibrosis.  No evidence of acute focal
 pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
