                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion  // Evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size remains mild to moderately enlarged with a
 left ventricular predominance, unchanged.  The aorta remains markedly
 tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise similar.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases are nonspecific, and may reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Hypertrophic
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities in lung bases are nonspecific and may
 reflect atelectasis.  Infection cannot be excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
