                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  A left pectoral AICD is unchanged in
 orientation, with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 There is minimal enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which shows a globular
 configuration.  Indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature and engorgement of
 the central vasculature is consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no focal airspace consolidation
 worrisome for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema.  
 2.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, which given the configuration,
 an underlying pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
