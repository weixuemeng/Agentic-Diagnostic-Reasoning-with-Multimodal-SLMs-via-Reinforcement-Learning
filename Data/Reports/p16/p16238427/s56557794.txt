                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post V-fib arrest and intubation, on
 hypothermic protocol.  Evaluation for interval change in right lower lobe
 opacity concerning for evolving pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to prior radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates overall
 interval improvement in right lower lobe opacity since the prior study,
 although a right infrahilar opacity remains.  An endotracheal tube remains in
 appropriate position, terminating 5.4 cm above the level of the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm and out of view.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.  A
 small left pleural effusion is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement in right lower lung opacification, with a small
 remaining infrahilar component, likely secondary to resolving asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.  Short-term follow-up radiographs are recommended after
 diuresis to ensure resolution.
