                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pain  // Rule out pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso dated ___, chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.  The bilateral
 costophrenic angles are not well visualized, which may be secondary to trace
 pleural effusions versus atelectasis versus body habitus.  The upper lung
 fields are grossly clear without lobar consolidation or pneumothorax.  Heart
 is moderately enlarged and the descending thoracic aorta is tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable, moderate cardiomegaly and mild central vascular pulmonary congestion. 
 Possible trace bilateral pleural effusions.  No lobar consolidation.
