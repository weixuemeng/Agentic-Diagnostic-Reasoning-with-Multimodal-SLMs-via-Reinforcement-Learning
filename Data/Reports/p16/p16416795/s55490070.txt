  Portable upright radiograph demonstrates a right PICC which appears terminates
  in the anticipated location of the right atrium.  Previously present opacity
  within the lower right lung zone is less conspicuous relative to prior study
  dated ___.  No new focal consolidation is identified. 
  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable in size and configuration.  
  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may reflect a small pleural effusion.
  There is no pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with h/o aortic stenosis, being treated for
 septic arthritis now with increased respiratory rate and bibasilar crackles on
 exam  // evidence of volume overload or infiltrates increased from ___?    
 evidence of volume overload or infiltrates increased from ___?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is within
 normal limits and the pulmonary vascular congestion has decreased.  There has
 been decrease in the opacification at the right base.  This this could
 represent clearing of a lower lung consolidation or mild residual of
 asymmetric edema.
