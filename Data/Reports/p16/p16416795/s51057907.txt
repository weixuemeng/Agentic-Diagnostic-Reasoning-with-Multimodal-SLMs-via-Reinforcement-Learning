 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bacteremia, right hip and knee septic
 arthritis, metabolic acidosis I/s/o infection with increased resp effort  //
 infectious vs. volume overload     infectious vs. volume overload
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 23:27
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 11:44 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the previous study, the pulmonary vasculature has become more
 ill-defined consistent with interval appearance of mild interstitial edema. 
 Bibasilar patchy opacities have also slightly increased favoring lower lobe
 patchy atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be
 considered.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished
 given semi upright technique.  No large effusions.
