                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Low ejection fraction, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 in a patient with intact midline sternal wires and dialysis catheter extending
 to the region of the cavoatrial junction.  Mild atelectatic changes are seen
 at the bases.  There is some engorgement of ill-defined pulmonary vessels,
 consistent with some elevation in pulmonary venous pressure.  No evidence of
 acute focal pneumonia.
