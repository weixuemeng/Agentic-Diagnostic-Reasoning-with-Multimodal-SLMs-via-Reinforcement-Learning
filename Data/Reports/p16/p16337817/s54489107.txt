                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with pneumothorax, chest tube to succion.
 
 COMPARISON : ___ 8:54 am
 
 Large left tension pneumothorax is unchanged.  The lines are in adequate
 position with feeding tube, NG tube, right jugular line, PICC line ending in
 the right axillary region and right-sided pigtail.  Small right apical
 pneumothorax is stable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 The exam is unchanged since previous exam done at 8:54 a.m.  
 
 This was discussed with the medical team. Large left tension pneumothorax is
 stable even if the chest tube has been put on succion raising the possibility
 of a malfunctioning/malpositioned tube.
