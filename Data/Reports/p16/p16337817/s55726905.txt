 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:13 PM
  Tracheostomy tube, right internal jugular dialysis catheter, left
  PICC line and right chest tube are in stable position.  Aortic CoreValve is
  unchanged.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is consistent
  with trace pleural effusion, but no pneumothorax.  Moderate left pleural
  effusion is not significantly changed with slight redistribution related to
  position.  No change in mild pulmonary edema.

 and left PICC line in unchanged position.  Minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle consistent with small effusion is unchanged but there is no
 pneumothorax.  Moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged as are heart size
 and mediastinal contours.
