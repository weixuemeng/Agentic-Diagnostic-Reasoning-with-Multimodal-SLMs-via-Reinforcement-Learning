                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with history of pneumothorax and chest tube
 placement; assess for interval change, patient intubated.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. 
 
 Cardiomegaly is obscured by the pleuroparenchymal abnormalities.  Large right
 pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is grossly unchanged allowing the
 difference in position of the patient.  Extensive right chest wall
 subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged.  Lines and tubes and aortic stent are in
 standard position.
