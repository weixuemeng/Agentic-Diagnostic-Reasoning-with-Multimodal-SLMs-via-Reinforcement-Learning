                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP supine radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously seen bilateral basilar opacities are markedly worse with
 an increase in the basal consolidation and bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild
 vascular congestion is observed.  An opacity in the left mid lung field is
 observed and correlates with a calcified pleural plaque in left hemithorax
 better visualized on prior CT; otherwise pleural surfaces are unremarkable. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Aorta is mildly calcified.  Heart size is within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Dense right lower lobe opacity and left lower lobe consolidation concerning
 for pneumonia.  
 2) Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  
 3) Mild vascular congestion compatible with previous CT imaging.
