 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

 post-placement xray  // **please do upright film to evaluate for resolution of
 RUL opacity**      **please do upright film to evaluate for resolution of RUL

 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph ___:39.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian line ends in the low SVC, unchanged.  Opacity extending from
 the right upper mediastinum to the apex has not worsened.  In the absence of
 tracheal or mediastinal displacement, I do not think this is hematoma,
 certainly not active bleeding.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomegaly is mild.  Pneumoperitoneum is explained by recent gastrostomy.
