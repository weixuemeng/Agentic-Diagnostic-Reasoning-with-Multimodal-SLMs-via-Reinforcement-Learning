 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The left
 costophrenic angle is probably due to minor atelectasis.  There is no
 convincing evidence for pleural effusion on the lateral view.  The lungs
 appear otherwise clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
