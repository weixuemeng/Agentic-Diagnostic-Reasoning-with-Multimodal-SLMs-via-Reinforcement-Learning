                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with acute pancreatitis, cough, and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA, lateral, right lateral decubitus, and left lateral decubitus
 images of the chest demonstrate moderate right pleural effusion and small left
 pleural effusion which are seen layering in the decubitus images.  Atelectasis
 and pleural effusions have improved since prior imaging.  Cardiac silhouette
 is partially obscured by the pleural effusions, limiting evaluation of the
 cardiac size.  Mediastinum is unchanged.  There is no evidence of focal
 consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate right and small left pleural effusions, improved since
 prior imaging.
