                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Breast cancer, acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath,
 tachycardia and tachypnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, chest CTA ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions appear increased in size compared to the previous
 exam.  Worsening opacification with ill-defined nodularity is noted at both
 lung bases. There is no pneumothorax.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is
 demonstrated.  Clips are seen within the right axillary region, and the
 patient is status post right mastectomy.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased size of small bilateral pleural effusions and worsening bibasilar
 airspace opacities, right greater than left.  Findings could reflect pneumonia
 or aspiration superimposed on a background of lymphangitic spread of tumor,
 though disease progression is also not excluded.
