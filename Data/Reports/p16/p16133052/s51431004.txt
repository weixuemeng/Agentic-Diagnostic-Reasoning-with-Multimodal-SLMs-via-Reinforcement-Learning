                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of metastatic breast cancer, now with shortness of breath
 and tachypnea.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with patient in upright
 position.  
 
 A left PICC line terminates in the lower SVC.  There is now an increased right
 upper lobe opacity in addition to the bilateral, right greater than left,
 opacities previously seen.  This radiograph underestimates the extent of the
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions which are better assessed on the CT scan
 from today.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased right upper lobe opacity in addition to stable bilateral mid and
 lower lung opacities.  
 
 2.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions better assessed on CT performed
 today.
