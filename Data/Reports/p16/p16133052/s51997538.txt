                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph. 
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Right hilum is abnormally dense compared to
 the left hilum, corresponding to enlarged lymph nodes in this region on recent
 CTA of the chest of ___.  Bilateral peribronchiolar opacities in
 the mid and lower lungs bilaterally show improvement compared to the previous
 study, particularly within the right middle lobe.  No new areas of lung
 opacification are identified, and there are no definite pleural effusions. 
 Bones appear somewhat heterogeneous.  Note is made of previous right
 mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Improving peribronchiolar opacities, possibly due to an improving atypical
 pneumonia.  Continued radiographic followup recommended to ensure resolution. 
 
 2.  Right hilar prominence corresponding to right hilar lymphadenopathy on
 previous CTA of the chest.  This could be reactive or due to metastatic
 disease in this patient with history of right breast cancer.
