 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of
 fluid overload have minimally decreased in severity.  They are, however, still
 clearly visible.  No pleural effusions.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Currently, there is no radiographic evidence of other pathologic
 parenchymal processes.  No pneumothorax.
