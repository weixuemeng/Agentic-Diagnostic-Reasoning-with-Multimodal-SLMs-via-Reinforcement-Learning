                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of sickle cell anemia with shoulder pain.  Evaluate for
 an acute chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position with the tip in
 the proximal right atrium.  There is mild vascular congestion, which is likely
 chronic.  There is no focal airspace opacity, pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is a contour of the main pulmonary artery,
 likely reflecting a degree of pulmonary hypertension.  The mediastinal
 contours are otherwise normal.  The heart size is at the upper limits of
 normal.  Again, no definite splenic shadow is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
