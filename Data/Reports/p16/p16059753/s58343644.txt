                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with neutropenia and now cough.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  While there is again mild interstitial
 prominence, the opacities in the right lower lobe appear to be slightly worse
 than on several comparison films.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the
 right atrium.  Left lung appears with chronic interstitial markings but no
 evidence of pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  More so than on past exams, prominence of the right lower lobe
 interstitial markings could be consistent with an early or atypical pneumonia
 in this neutropenic patient.
