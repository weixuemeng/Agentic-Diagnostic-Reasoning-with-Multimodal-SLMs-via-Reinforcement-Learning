                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with sickle cell crisis, evaluate for
 infiltrate or acute chest syndrome.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PA and lateral chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph was obtained.  Compared to the most
 recent prior radiograph, there are new diffuse bilateral pulmonary
 infiltrates.  In addition, there has been significant enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette, prominence of the pulmonary artery, and distention of the
 azygous vein, consistent with right heart failure.  These findings are
 concerning for cor pulmonale in the setting of acute sickle cell crisis. 
 Bilateral infiltrates are likely due to pulmonary edema; however, infarction
 and infection cannot be excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Also demonstrated are multiple loops of distended large bowel,
 although the abdomen is incompletely evaluated on this film.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Since the recen radiograph one day prior, there has been development of
 new bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, likely pulmonary edema, however
 infection and infarction cannot be excluded.  
 2.  Development of marked cardiomegaly and findings consistent with heart
 failure.  
 3.  Multiple loops of distended large bowel incompletely imaged on this
 radiograph.
 
 These findings were discussed with the resident caring for the patient by Dr.
 ___ ___ telephone at 2:45 p.m.
