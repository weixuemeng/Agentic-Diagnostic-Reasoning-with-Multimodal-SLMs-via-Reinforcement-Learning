                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Septic shock, rule out mediastinitis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:03 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the appearance of the
 mediastinum is constant.  Also constant is the size of the cardiac silhouette.
 However, the vascular diameters increased and the interstitial structures
 become more visible.  Overall, the findings are suggestive for
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Right pectoral Port-A-Cath in
 unchanged position.
