                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sickle cell disease, fevers and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the proximal right atrium,
 unchanged.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion appears improved compared to
 the prior exam.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Linear scarring within both lung bases is re- demonstrated. 
 H-shaped morphology of the vertebral bodies is compatible with sickle cell
 disease.  A normal splenic shadow is not identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, improved compared to the prior exam.
