                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with sickle cell anemia, pain crisis, and
 chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema is seen.  Mild interstitial prominence appears stable compared
 to multiple prior exams and likely corresponds to underlying sickle cell
 disease.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Concavity
 of the vertebral body endplates is consistent with sequela of sickle cell
 disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic interstitial prominence without radiographic evidence for
 acute process.
