                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of sickle cell disease with recent cough and chest pain. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The mild interstitial prominence seen bilaterally is unchanged from
 the prior exam and is likely related to the patient's underlying sickle cell
 disease.  There is no consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Concavity of the
 vertebral bodies is again noted and a sequelae of sickle cell disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged chronic interstitial prominence, likely related to sickle cell
 disease.
 2.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
