                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pneumoperitoneum, s/p RIJ line placement  //
 Eval RIJ CVL position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:20
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous
 catheter, terminating in the low SVC/ cavoatrial junction. Endotracheal tube
 is seen terminating approximately 3.9 cm above level the carina. Lung volumes
 remain low and there is minimal left basilar atelectasis. No evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen. No large pleural effusion is seen. Again, large lucency
 beneath the right hemidiaphragm is highly worrisome for pneumoperitoneum.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of right IJ central venous catheter terminating in the low
 SVC/ cavoatrial junction without evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Pneumoperitoneum partially imaged.
