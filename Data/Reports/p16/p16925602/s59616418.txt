                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  An ___-year-old woman with hypotension, evaluate for infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to radiograph from ___, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are stable, within normal limits. The bilateral hila are within
 normal limits. There has been interval improvement in lung aeration and a
 decrease in pulmonary vascular engorgement. Linear opacities within the
 bilateral lower lung zones likely represent platelike atelectasis. There is no
 focal lung consolidation.  There has been improvement in the moderate left
 pleural effusion, now small, with likely adjacent compressive atelectasis best
 appreciated on lateral view. Again seen is a small right pleural effusion.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement in lung aeration and pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. Improvement in left pleural effusion, now small.  Small right pleural
 effusion.
