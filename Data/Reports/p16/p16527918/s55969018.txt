                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate effusions, the patient POD 3 CABG.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Widened mediastinum has improved.  Moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions larger on the left side associated with adjacent
 atelectasis are grossly unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of
 the patient.  There is no pneumothorax.  The upper lungs are clear.
