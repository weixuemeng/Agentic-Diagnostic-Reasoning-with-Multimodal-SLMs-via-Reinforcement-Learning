                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain radiating to the back, now resolved.  Please assess
 for possible aortic dissection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  Note is made of a mildly tortuous aorta,
 otherwise the hilar and mediastinal contours are normal. There is no evidence
 of aortic dilatation.  The lungs are clear without evidence of focal
 consolidations concerning for infection.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 No evidence of aortic dilatation or mediastinal widening, however, a CTA of
 the chest would be the test of choice to evaluate for an aortic dissection.
