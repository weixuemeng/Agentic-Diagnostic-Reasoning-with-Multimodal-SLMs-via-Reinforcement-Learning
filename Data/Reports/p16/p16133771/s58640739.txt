                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure with possible aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support devices have been
 removed.  There again are low lung volumes with bibasilar opacification
 consistent with atelectasis and small effusions.  Some indistinctness of
 mildly engorged pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure, though they may merely be a manifestation of the low lung volumes.
