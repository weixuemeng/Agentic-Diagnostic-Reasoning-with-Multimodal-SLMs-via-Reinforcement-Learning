                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from approximately one hour earlier.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with history of esophageal stricture, GI
 bleed, hypotension, status post CVL placement, assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph obtained.  As seen
 previously, there is a left IJ central venous catheter with its tip unchanged
 in the expected location of the superior vena cava.  Lung volumes remain low
 with an elevated right hemidiaphragm again seen.  There is improved aeration
 in the left lower lung with probable residual left basilar atelectasis.  No
 large effusion is seen.  Upper lungs are well aerated.  Clips in the right
 upper quadrant noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left IJ central venous catheter in unchanged and appropriate
 position.  Improved aeration at the left lung base.  Stable elevated right
 hemidiaphragm.
