                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  New central venous catheter placement, failed right
 attempt, assess line position or pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP supine portable chest radiograph obtained.  There is a left IJ
 central venous catheter with its tip in the expected level of the superior
 vena cava.  There is opacity at the left lung base which could reflect
 consolidation and/or effusion.  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 which appears chronic.  There is associated right lung base atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size appears stable.  Clips are noted in the
 right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Appropriately positioned left IJ central venous catheter.  No
 evidence of complication.  Left basal opacity likely consolidation with
 possible effusion.
