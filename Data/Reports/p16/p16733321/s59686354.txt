                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Palpitations.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Medial right
 basilar opacity similar to prior is felt to represent overlap of vascular
 structures.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Incidental note is made of an azygos lobe. 
 The aorta is somewhat tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  There
 may be very minimal vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible very minimal vascular congestion.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
