                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with chest pain.  Evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No significant interval change other than a small focal opacity in the right
 upper lobe which could represent a focal consolidation, mucous plugging, or
 areas of superimposed normal structures.  No pleural effusion, edema, or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Descending thoracic
 aorta calcifications are unchanged.  Mild dextroconvex scoliosis of the
 thoracic spine is also unchanged.  Moderate anterior osteophytes in the lower
 thoracic vertebral bodies are unchanged.  An incidental azygous fissure is
 again noted.  There is pectus excavatum.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small focal rounded opacity in the peripheral right upper lobe could reflect
 focal pneumonia or mucous plugging, less likely a mass given the short time
 course of development.  Recommend treatment for infection and short interval
 follow-up after treatment to ensure resolution.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up radiograph after treatment for pneumonia to
 ensure resolution of new right upper lobe opacity.
