                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a cough and fever and left basal rhonchi.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Greater heterogeneous opacification in the right infrahilar lung seen on the
 frontal view alone is sufficient to raise concern of pneumonia.  Upper lobes
 show hyperlucency due to emphysema.  Lungs, particularly the left lower lobe
 are otherwise clear.  Heart size is normal and there is no pleural effusion or
 strong evidence of central lymph node enlargement.  I would recommend careful
 followup with a repeat chest radiograph in no more than six weeks to
 demonstrate a substantial clearing.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 1:30 p.m. when the findings were recognized.
