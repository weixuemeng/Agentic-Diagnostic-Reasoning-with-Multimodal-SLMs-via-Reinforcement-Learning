                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with epigastric, left upper quadrant pain, history
 of valve replacement, new T7 compression  fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___, thoracic
 spine radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic, mitral, and tricuspid
 valve replacement.  Severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  Prominence of
 the pulmonary artery again raises concern for underlying pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion, improved from the previous chest radiograph, likely
 chronic.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Compression deformities involving T7,
 T12, and L1 are better assessed on the recent thoracic spine radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged severe cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion without
 overt pulmonary edema.  Known compression deformities involving the
 thoracolumbar spine are better assessed on the previous thoracic spine
 radiograph.
