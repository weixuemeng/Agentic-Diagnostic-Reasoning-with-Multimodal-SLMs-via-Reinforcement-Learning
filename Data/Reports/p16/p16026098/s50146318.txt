                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Right hemodialysis line infection.  Bacteremia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Vascular stents in both brachiocephalic veins terminating low in the SVC are
 unchanged in position since ___ following removal of the previous
 right supraclavicular central venous line and placement of an ascending line
 for dialysis that terminates in the right atrium.  There is greater fullness
 in the right paratracheal soft tissue of the mediastinum that could be due to
 adenopathy, or venous congestion.  Consideration should be given to possible
 CT scanning, particularly if there is some concern about mediastinal abscess,
 although that is a very unusual complication of septicemia.  Lungs are clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.
