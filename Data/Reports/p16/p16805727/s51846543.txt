                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac history, on chronic amiodarone, to assess for fibrosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and
 no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Single-channel pacemaker lead
 extends to the region of the apex of the right ventricle.  Cardiac silhouette
 is at the upper limits of normal in size.  No vascular congestion, pleural
 effusion, or acute pneumonia.
 
 Specifically, no evidence of interstitial changes suggestive of amiodarone
 toxicity.
