                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pneumonia and continued high
 fevers.  Study requested to rule out worsening pneumonia, abscess and/or
 pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior radiograph from ___, there has been
 interval worsening. There is increased opacification of the right heart border
 and right hemidiaphragm, concerning for worsening pneumonia, mostly at the
 right middle and lower lobes. There is a new right perihilar consolidation.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. A
 single-channel pacemaker lead terminates in the right ventricle.
 
 At the intersection of the right second anterior rib and the right fifth
 posterior rib there is a linear and nodular opacity which has apparently
 increased  compared to prior examination from ___ and appears
 separate from the above findings. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Worsening pneumonia, mostly in the right middle and lower lobes with a new
 focal right perihilar consolidation.
 
 2.  Separate from these findings is an apparently slowly growing nodule in the
 right upper lobe.  Radiographic follow up within 8 weeks is recommended  for
 evaluation of interval resolution of the above-described right middle/lower
 lobe pneumonia.  If increase in right upper lobe nodule size persists at that
 time, further followup is recommended with CT.
