                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Prolonged smoking history with congestive heart
 failure and left ventricular ejection fraction decreased.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  New interstitial opacity is
 noted in both lower lungs bilaterally that might be consistent with minimal
 interstitial vascular engorgement.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen. 
 Alternatively infectious process would be another possibility.  Given the
 short-term prior followup, interval development of interstitial lung disease
 is less likely, although it is still possible.
