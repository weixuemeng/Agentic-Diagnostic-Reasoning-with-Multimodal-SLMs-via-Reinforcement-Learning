                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension, confusion, and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are reduced compared to the previous exam, causing accentuation
 of the cardiac silhouette size.  Heart size is still within normal limits. 
 Aortic knob is calcified.  Spiculated right hilar mass appears relatively
 unchanged compared to the previous exam.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures as a result of low lung volumes but no overt
 pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities could
 reflect atelectasis due to low lung volumes, but infection or aspiration
 cannot be completely excluded.  Calcified pleural plaque within the left lung
 base is unchanged as are bullous emphysematous changes in the lung apices.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities present.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Low lung volumes.  Bibasilar patchy airspace opacities could reflect
 atelectasis but aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.
 
 2. Unchanged right hilar mass.
 
 3. Bullous emphysema.
