                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with multiple rib
 fractures.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained the same day earlier.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 6 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip is most
 likely in the stomach.  Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged. 
 Left chest tube is in place.  The assessment of the lung films reveals no
 interval development of new abnormalities besides the right middle lobe
 atelectasis that is apparently new.  Bilateral small pleural effusions are
 better appreciated on the CT torso.  Rib fracture is also better seen on the
 cross-sectional images than on the current chest radiograph.  No new
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.
