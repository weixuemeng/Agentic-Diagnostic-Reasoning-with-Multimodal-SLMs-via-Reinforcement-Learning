 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with past medical history of extensive metastatic
 stage IV lung cancer.  Respiratory failure requiring intubation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Rapid progression of opacification in the right lung suggests aggressive

 metastases.  No endotracheal tube is seen on this examination.  There appears
 to be an esophageal stent in place at the level of the thoracic inlet.  Left
 lung is chronically airless.
