 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Extensive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, history of
 obstructive pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing opacities
 in the right lung have substantially increased in extent and severity. 
 Although some of the opacities are rounded and suggest the presence of lung
 nodules, there also is a parenchymal component with multiple air bronchograms,
 suggesting an infectious origin.
 
 The complete opacification of the left hemithorax is unchanged.  Unchanged
 left Port-A-Cath, unchanged vertebral stabilization devices.  In the interval,
 the nasogastric tube has been removed.
