                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with diastolic CHF and renal insufficiency
 status post transplant and Klebsiella bacteremia, now requiring assessment for
 pneumonia or pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes
 likely secondary to poor inspiration.  Again seen are bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The right pleural effusion has improved since prior imaging. 
 There is a large retrocardiac opacity, likely representing pleural effusion
 and atelectasis.  There is an area of opacity at the right base which is
 likely atelectasis versus possible pneumonia.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 A left IJ is seen in place with the tip in the mid SVC.  Previously seen
 pigtail catheter is not well visualized on this exam.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured by pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of right pleural effusion.  Right basilar opacity
 likely represents atelectasis or possibly pneumonia.  Large retrocardiac
 opacity likely represents pleural effusion and atelectasis.
