                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:53 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with worsening hypoxia, question interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:58 p.m.:
 
 The right lung is now entirely airless.  This collapse may have been prompted
 by an increase in right pleural effusion, but I cannot assess that change by
 virtue of mediastinal position because of an enlarging moderate left pleural
 effusion in the left hemithorax.  Nevertheless, attempt should be made to
 ensure that the airway is clear before attempting to reexpand the right lung
 with thoracentesis alone.  Left paramedian pericardiocentesis catheter and the
 left supraclavicular central venous catheter set ending in the SVC and upper
 right atrium are unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  Findings of subsequent chest
 radiograph will be discussed with the clinical service, if appropriate.
