 Large right pleural effusion has markedly increased.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 partially obscured by the right pleural effusion.  There are atelectasis in
 the lower lobes bilaterally, right greater than left, and in the right upper
 lobes.  There is probably a small left pleural effusion.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Sternal wires are aligned.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Markedly increase in size in large right pleural effusion.
