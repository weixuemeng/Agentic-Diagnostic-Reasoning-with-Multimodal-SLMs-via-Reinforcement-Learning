  projecting over the mediastinum. Low lung volumes.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:58 P.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man after pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis.  Is
 there a pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 9 a.m.:
 
 This supine chest radiograph is compared to an earlier upright or semi-erect
 one.  It shows a clear decrease in the size of previously moderate to large
 right pleural effusion, but I cannot assess whether there has been any
 decrease in caliber of the large cardiomediastinal silhouette and the moderate
 left pleural effusion layering posteriorly cannot be compared to the volume of
 pleural fluid dependent on the earlier study.  Pulmonary edema is minimal if
 any despite the very low lung volumes.  New pericardiocentesis catheter in
 left paramedian position ascends to the level of the aortopulmonic window. 
 Dialysis catheter set ends in the low SVC and upper right atrium.  No
 pneumothorax.
