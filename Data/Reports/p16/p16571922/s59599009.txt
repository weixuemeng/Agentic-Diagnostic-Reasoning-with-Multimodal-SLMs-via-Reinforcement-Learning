 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post thoracocentesis, questionable pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 thoracocentesis.  There is no convincing evidence of pneumothorax.  On the
 right, a pigtail catheter has been placed into the pleural space and the
 extent of the pre-existing pleural effusion has minimally decreased. 
 Otherwise, there is no relevant change.  Sternal wires in correct alignment,
 left internal jugular vein catheter.  Bilateral pleural effusions with
 moderate bilateral areas of atelectasis.  Overall, the lung volumes remain
 low.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
