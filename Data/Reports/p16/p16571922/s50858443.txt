                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Renal transplant, pleural effusions and GNR sepsis.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Large right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Allowing the difference in
 positioning of the patient, cardiac size is obscured by the pleural effusion. 
 Left lower lobe opacity is a combination of atelectasis and small effusion. 
 There are no new lung opacities.  Left IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. 
 Sternal wires are aligned.
