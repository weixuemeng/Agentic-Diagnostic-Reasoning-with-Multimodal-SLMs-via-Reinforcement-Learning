                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT abdomen and pelvis ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior chest radiograph, there is a new large right
 pleural effusion.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema or consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac size is likely enlarged, although not well evaluated due to the
 adjacent pleural effusion.  The azygos vein is enlarged.  A left hemodialysis
 catheter ends at or just beyond the atriocaval junction.  Sternal wires are
 intact.  Prominent loops of bowel are noted in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New large right and small left pleural effusions.
 2.  Enlarged azygos vein.  Given known pericardial effusion, this raises a
 concern for tamponade physiology.  Recommend clinical correlation.
 
 In addition, on review of the prior exams, calcification of a possible
 bicuspid aortic valve is identified and of unclear hemodynamic significance.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 11:22 a.m. on ___ via
 telephone by Dr. ___ ___ minutes after the findings were discovered.
