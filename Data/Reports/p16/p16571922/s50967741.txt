                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:13 P.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with a history of AFib, hypertension,
 immunosuppressed after renal transplant.  AFib with rapid ventricular rate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mediastinal vascular engorgement is more pronounced, and there may be very
 early interstitial edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly is exaggerated by AP
 positioning and low lung volumes.  Pleural effusions are small if any.  No
 pneumothorax.  No pneumonia.  Deflection of the trachea is due to imaging at
 relative low lung volume.
