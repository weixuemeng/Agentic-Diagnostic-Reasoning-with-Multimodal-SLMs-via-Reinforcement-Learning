 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with aortic regurgitation and signs of heart
 failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly has worsened and small bilateral pleural effusions have
 increased.  There has been no change in mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 septal thickening in the right lower lung which is a chronic feature, probably
 an indication of previous, but not necessarily a current episode of pulmonary
 edema.
