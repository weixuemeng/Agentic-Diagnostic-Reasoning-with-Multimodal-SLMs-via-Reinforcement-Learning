                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Treated pneumonia, to assess for resolution.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change.  Low
 lung volumes most likely account for the mild prominence of the transverse
 diameter of the heart.  There are atelectatic changes at the bases, but no
 evidence of acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.  
 
 Of incidental note is substantial dilatation of the gas-filled fundus of the
 stomach.
