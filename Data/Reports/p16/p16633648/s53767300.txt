                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Rt. brachial plexopathy and Hx smoking.  //
 ? mass lesion Rt. apex, or thoracic rib to contribute to/cause Rt. brachial
 plexopathy.     ? mass lesion Rt. apex, or thoracic rib to contribute to/cause
 Rt. brachial plexopathy., ? apical mass/thoracic rib
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No comparison.  The right upper lobe shows a relatively extensive ill-defined
 parenchymal opacity with air bronchograms and multiple nodular components. 
 The changes are limited by the minor fissure.  The most likely differential
 diagnosis is pneumonia.  However, of the antibiotic therapy, resolution needs
 to be radiologically documented to exclude a coexisting neoplasm.
 
 Otherwise unremarkable chest x-ray.  In particular there is no evidence for
 the presence of a right apical Pancoast lesion.  No pleural effusions.  No
 pulmonary edema.  Normal size of the heart.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Radiographic followup until complete resolution of the
 right upper lobe pneumonia is documented.
