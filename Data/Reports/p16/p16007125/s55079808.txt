                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with diabetes, hypoglycemia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Subtle opacity
 identified in the right lung laterally.  The lungs are otherwise clear without
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the right mid lung laterally, potentially
 atelectasis.  Repeat exam with better inspiratory effort on the frontal exam
 can be performed to clarify, as infection is not completely excluded.
