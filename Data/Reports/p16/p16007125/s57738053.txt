                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post intubation, assess position
 of endotracheal tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided.  Tip of the
 endotracheal tube resides 3.6 cm above the carina. There is retrocardiac
 linear density likely reflective of left lower lobe atelectasis. The lungs
 appear otherwise clear, though lung volumes are low.  Prominence of the
 pulmonary hila likely reflects bronchovascular crowding.  The heart size is
 normal.  No supine evidence for pneumothorax or effusion.  Bony structures
 appear intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube.  No overt
 abnormalities in the chest.
