                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Reactive airways disease now with worsening dyspnea, here to
 evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.  
 
 Technique:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are symmetrically well-expanded and well aerated without focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky basilar opacities
 suggest atelectasis or airway inflammation.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Mild biapical pleural thickening is noted on the left greater than
 the right.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  The thoracic aorta is slightly
 tortuous.  The trachea is midline.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.
