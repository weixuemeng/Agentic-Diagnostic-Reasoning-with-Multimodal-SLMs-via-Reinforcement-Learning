  Lung volumes are slightly low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and
  accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is minimal bibasilar
  atelectasis.  No focal consolidation is seen.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac
  silhouette is not significantly changed.  There are no definite pleural
  effusions.  No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cirrhosis, altered mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 CHEST:  Low lung volumes.  Probable cardiomegaly.  No effusions.  There is
 increased density over both lungs which could indicate some mild failure, but
 may be due to the low lung volumes.
