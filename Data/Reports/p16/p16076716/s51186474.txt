                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with AMS, rule out acute process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 15:49.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 13:31 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The heart remains stably enlarged, suggestive of cardiomegaly, although
 pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded.  There has been interval
 appearance of a few streaky opacities in the retrocardiac region, which could
 represent an area of atelectasis, although aspiration or early pneumonia
 should be considered.  Clinical correlation is advised.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  No pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
 Mediastinal contours are stable.  No large pleural effusions.  Clips in the
 right upper quadrant consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
