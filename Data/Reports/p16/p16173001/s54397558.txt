                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post biventricular pacemaker upgrade,
 question lead position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate appropriate
 positioning of a right atrial, right ventricular, and left ventricular lead. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are again seen, there is resolving mild
 pulmonary edema. Right basilar opacity may refect atelectasis or infection. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette remains markedly enlarged. 
 The mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolving mild pulmonary edema, with small bilateral pleural
 effusions. Increased opacity at the right base likely reflects atelectasis,
 though in the appropriate clinical setting pneumonia should be considered.
