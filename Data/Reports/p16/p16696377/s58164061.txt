  The tip of the PICC is difficult to see, though appears to be unchanged in
  position, sitting within the mid SVC. Since the prior exam, the left internal
  jugular central venous catheter, NG tube, and endotracheal tube have been
  removed. Bibasilar atelectasis is similar. No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  PICC placement evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A left PICC is again demonstrated, however the catheter is not seen beyond the
 level of the brachiocephalic, obscured by overlying soft tissues.  There has
 been interval removal of a left internal jugular central venous catheter and
 NGT, and the patient is now extubated.  There is no pneumothorax, focal
 consolidation, or pleural effusion. A benign-appearing subcentimeter sclerotic
 lesion within the proximal right humerus is again demonstrated.
