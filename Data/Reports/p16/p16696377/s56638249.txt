                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman outside hospital transfer with PICC.  //
 Confirm placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from___ dated ___.
 Radiograph from ___ dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left subclavian PICC line is present, at fall is a somewhat atypical course
 but appears to terminate in the upper/mid SVC. No pneumothorax detected.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes. There is upper zone redistribution and mild
 vascular plethora. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Extreme right costophrenic
 angle excluded from the film. Allowing for this, no gross effusion. Heart size
 is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged, appearing stable
 compared to the recent prior films. The appearance is likely accentuated by
 low lung volumes.  Mediastinal clips noted. Review of OMR indicates a history
 of sternal debridement in bilateral pectoralis flaps.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 PICC line tip over proximal/mid SVC. Please see comment above.
 Probable mild cardiomegaly and mild CHF. Bibasilar atelectasis.
