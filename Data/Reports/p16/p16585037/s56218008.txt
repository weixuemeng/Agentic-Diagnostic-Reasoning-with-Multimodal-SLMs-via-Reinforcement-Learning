                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness and dyspnea.  Evaluate for fluid overload or mediastinal
 widening.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired. 
 Midline sternotomy wires are intact.  Surgical clips are noted throughout the
 left hemithorax.  Round opacities projecting over the area of the aortic root
 are thought to represent coronary artery markers.
 
 There is a diffuse interstitial abnormality that is more prominent in the
 lower lungs, possibly at least partially attributable to mild-to-moderate
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is no focal consolidation.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The bones are probably demineralized.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Diffuse interstitial opacities with a bilateral lower lobe predominance,
 thought to be at least partially attributable to mild-to-moderate interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  A coinciding underlying interstitial abnormality could be
 considered as well, however.  Correlation with any prior imaging is
 recommended to assess the degree of change from the patient's baseline. 
 Although doubted, an atypical infectious process cannot be completely excluded
 to explain a widespread interstitial abnormality.  
 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly.
