                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Ascites and lower-extremity edema in a patient with metastatic
 pancreatic cancer. Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and ___.  CT abdomen/pelvis from the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate multiple sternal wires. Lung
 volumes are low, with resultant bronchovascular crowding and prominence of the
 cardiac silhouette. Retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis,
 although a superimposed focal consolidation cannot be excluded. There is
 persistent opacity of the right lower lobe.  No appreciable vascular
 congestion or pulmonary edema is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with prominence of the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular crowding.
 2. Persistent opacity of the right lower lobe, consistent with fibrosis and
 volume loss seen on the CT from the same day.
