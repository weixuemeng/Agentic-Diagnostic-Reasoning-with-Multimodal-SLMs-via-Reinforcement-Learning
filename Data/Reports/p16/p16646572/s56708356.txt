                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Nausea.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 increase in interstitial markings bilaterally suggesting mild interstitial
 edema.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no definite focal
 consolidation.  Biapical pleural thickening is seen.  Subtle opacity
 projecting over the right apex appears pleural and may be due to scarring;
 however, this could be confirmed on chest CT if of clinical concern.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial edema.  Subtle right apical opacity, best seen
 on the frontal view is non-specific and could relate to pleural apical
 thickening.  However, this could be better evaluated on a non-urgent CT.
