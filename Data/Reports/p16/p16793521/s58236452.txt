                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Generalized fatigue.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Sternotomy wires are
 intact.  Lung volumes are low, exaggerating bronchovascular markings. 
 Top-normal heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. 
 Calcification of the aortic knob is stable.  Bibasilar opacities, larger on
 the right, are consistent with atelectasis although infection is not excluded.
 Tiny right pleural effusion.  No lobar consolidation or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis.  Infection could
 be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
