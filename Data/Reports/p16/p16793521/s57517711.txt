 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. There is mild
 enlargement of cardiac silhouette which is unchanged. The aorta is tortuous
 and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications. Mild pulmonary edema is
 demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis, though
 infection in the right lung base is not completely excluded. There are mild
 degenerative changes in both shoulders.

 Mild pulmonary edema. More focal opacity in the right lung base may reflect
 atelectasis though infection is not excluded.
