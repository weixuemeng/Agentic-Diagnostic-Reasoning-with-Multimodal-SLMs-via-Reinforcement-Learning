                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with nausea and vomiting.  Dizziness.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.
 
 There is blunting of the costophrenic angle suggestive of effusions, right
 greater than left.  Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings seen throughout
 suggestive of pulmonary edema.  More confluent consolidation identified at the
 right lung base as well, also worse compared to prior.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Elevation left hemidiaphragm again noted.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.  More
 confluent region of consolidation at the right lung base potentially related
 to asymmetric edema; however, acute infection is also possible.
