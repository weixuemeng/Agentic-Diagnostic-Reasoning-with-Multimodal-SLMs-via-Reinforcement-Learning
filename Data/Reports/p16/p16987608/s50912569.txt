                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded with emphysematous changes seen largely
 in the lower lobes with ring shadows suggestive of minimal bronchiectasis. 
 There is bilateral flattening of the hemidiaphragms.  No areas of focal
 consolidation, masses or lesions are seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is a large hiatal hernia; otherwise, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There is moderate
 kyphosis of the mid thoracic spine in which compression fractures of two of
 the mid thoracic vertebra is seen; chronicity of the fractures is
 indeterminate.  Old left lateral rib fractures are seen.  The pleural surfaces
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Emphysematous changes with minimal bronchiectasis seen in the lung bases. 
 Flattening of hemidiaphragms.  
 2) Large hiatal hernia. 
 3) No evidence of infection or malignancy.
