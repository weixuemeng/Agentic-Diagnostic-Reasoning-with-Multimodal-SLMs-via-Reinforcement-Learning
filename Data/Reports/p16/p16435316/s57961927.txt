                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lung nodule  // post bronch      post
 bronch
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no recent prior chest radiographs.  This study is read
 in conjunction with the chest CT performed ___ and fluoroscopic spot
 films performed earlier in the day.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Any pleural effusion on the right is small. New
 opacification surrounds the right upper lobe cavity seen on the recent chest
 CT, and there is new elevation of the minor fissure. These findings could be
 due to atelectasis alone or atelectasis due to hemorrhage and retained
 endobronchial blood. Similarly, opacification of the right lung base could be
 due to atelectasis alone or aspirated blood.  Heart is borderline enlarged,
 and I would not discount the possibility of early congestive heart failure. 
 Followup radiographs should be obtained at full inspiration to better evaluate
 these complicated findings.
