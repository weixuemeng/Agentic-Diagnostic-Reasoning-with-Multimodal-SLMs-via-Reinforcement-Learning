                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  New hypoxia.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by the projection.  Widened mediastinum could
 be due to increased mediastinal fat.  The interpretation of this study is
 limited due to patient body habitus. Ill-defined opacity in the left lower
 lobe, could represent pneumonia.  Superimposed soft tissues of the chest wall
 also contributes to this opacity.
