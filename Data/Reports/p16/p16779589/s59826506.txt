                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Numerous abnormalities have developed in the right hemithorax as
 compared to the previous baseline studies.  These include widening and
 enlargement of the mediastinal and hilar contours, concerning for
 lymphadenopathy; coalescent right juxtahilar opacity; diffuse reticular and
 nodular opacities; and bronchial wall thickening.  Additionally, a focal
 linear opacity is present adjacent to the right minor fissure and may
 represent linear atelectasis adjacent to fluid-filled fissure.  Left lung and
 pleural surfaces are clear.  Heart size remains normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Widespread abnormalities in the right hemithorax, including
 apparent mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, juxtahilar opacity, and
 diffuse reticular and nodular opacities.  The findings raise a concern for
 malignancy, but infectious disorders (particularly fungal or mycobacterial)
 could produce a similar radiographic appearance.  Initial further evaluation
 with a contrast-enhanced chest CT is recommended, as communicated by telephone
 to Dr. ___ at 3:55 p.m. on ___, approximately 10 minutes
 after the time of discovery.
