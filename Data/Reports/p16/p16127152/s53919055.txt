                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of diastolic dysfunction and CAD, presenting with dyspnea
 and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___; ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature is slightly indistinct
 with perihilar fullness, suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion without
 overt pulmonary edema.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
