                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, fever and
 hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable.  Persistent low
 lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding and there is persistent
 indistinct appearance of pulmonary vasculature and perihilar fullness
 suggesting congestion.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
