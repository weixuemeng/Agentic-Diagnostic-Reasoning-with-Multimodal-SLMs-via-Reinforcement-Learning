 HISTORY:  Recent surgery, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph and CT torso from ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  There is bilateral hilar and
 right paratracheal lymphadenopathy new since prior examination from ___. A small focal opacity in the right upper lung, projecting over the ___
 posterior rib is also new since prior. The right lung is otherwise clear.
 There is a new small left pleural effusion. Increased opacity at the left lung
 base is likely reflective of atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. New bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy and small focal opacity
 in the right upper lung for which further evaluation with a chest CT is
 recommended. 
 
 2.  New small left pleural effusion.
