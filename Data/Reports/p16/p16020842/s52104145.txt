 hemi thorax is considerable but it has not worsened.  It is a combination of
 left pleural effusion and atelectasis which would require CT scanning to on or
 off all.
 
 Heart is normal size.  ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard
 placements.  Right jugular line ends in the neck.
 
 Postoperative subcutaneous emphysema in the left thoracoabdominal wall is
 migrating superiorly or increasing.  Clinical attention is recommended to
 exclude infection.
