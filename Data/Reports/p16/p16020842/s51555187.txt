 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___:22.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Following tracheal extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube there has
 been marked progression of pulmonary consolidation previously predominating in
 the right upper lung at 07:22, now symmetrically involving both lungs more
 superiorly than inferiorly.  The rapid progression in the setting of new
 mediastinal venous engorgement is most consistent with pulmonary edema,
 perhaps with a preceding pneumonia.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusion is
 new or newly apparent.  Heart is normal size but increased in the antrum. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Right jugular line ends in the neck.
