 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:05 PM
  There is subcutaneous gas overlying the left lower chest wall.  There is no
  definite pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.  The lung volumes are lower with
  increased vascular congestion and a probable small left pleural effusion. 
  Additionally, there is a worsening retrocardiac opacity, which is likely
  atelectasis.  Infection cannot be excluded.  Apparent increase in size of the
  cardiac silhouette is likely due to the lower lung volumes, though close
  followup is recommended.  The lines and tubes are in satisfactory position.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p AAA repair  // please check chest/low abdomen
 film to eval for etiology of crepitus from mid L abdominal incision to just
 beneath L nipple     please check chest/low abdomen film to eval for etiology
 of
 
 COMPARISON:  Previous chest radiographs ___ at 16:43.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower, and atelectasis is moderate to severe in the left
 lower lobe, mild on the right.  Pleural effusion is small on the left if any. 
 No pneumothorax.  Interval increase in cardiac diameter, still normal,
 probably reflects intravascular volume increase and supine positioning.  There
 is no pulmonary edema although upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is well
 filled.
 
 Subcutaneous emphysema is extending superiorly along the left chest wall past
 skin ___.  Clinical inspection is advised.
 
 ET tube and trans esophageal drainage tube are in standard placements.
