                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p open AAA resection who remains intubated.  //
 ett placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT tip ends approximately 2.5 cm from the carina.  Bilateral low lung
 volumes persist and are probably overall unchanged.  Hazy opacification over
 the left hemithorax suggests persistent layering small pleural effusion.  In
 the setting of an effusion, evaluation for focal consolidation is limited. 
 Subcutaneous emphysema in the lower left lateral chest wall is the probably
 overall unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  Appearance of the the mediastinum and
 hila are overall unchanged.  Right internal jugular vein sheath ends in the
 upper SVC.  The enteric tube traverses the hemidiaphragm and ends in the
 expected region of the stomach in the left upper quadrant.  The stomach is not
 distended.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ETT appropriately positioned.
 2.  Small left pleural effusion.
