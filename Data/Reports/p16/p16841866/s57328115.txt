 INDICATION:  Low-grade fever and productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Streaky opacities
 in the left lower lobe appear probably unchanged and suggest minor atelectasis
 although a small component of suspected lingular atelectasis appears new. 
 However, there is no evidence for congestive heart failure convincing evidence
 for pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
