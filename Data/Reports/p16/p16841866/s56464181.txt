                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aortic arch
 is calcified with slight unfolding.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky
 retrocardiac opacities are visible in the left lower lobe, more dense and
 crowded than on the prior study.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  Bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive but a streaky opacity in the left lower lobe, more
 dense than on the prior study but fairly similar in morphology.  Accordingly,
 the possibility of chronic atelectasis or scarring could be considered, but a
 recurrent or superimposed infectious process is not excluded.
