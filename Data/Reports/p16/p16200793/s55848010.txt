                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with shortness of breath post cardiac surgery  //
 eval for effusions, infiltrates, atelectasis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiographs obtained 1 day prior, there is lateral
 displacement of the left hemidiaphragm apex, consistent with a subpulmonic
 effusion.  Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Increased right basilar
 opacities may be a combination of atelectasis and/or developing pneumonia. 
 Heart size and cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Median sternotomy
 wires are midline and intact.  Old posterior left rib fractures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased right basilar opacity is concerning for a combination of atelectasis
 and/or developing pneumonia.  Small, bilateral pleural effusions.
