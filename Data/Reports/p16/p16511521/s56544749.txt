                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall with confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Patchy right basilar
 opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  Known emphysematous changes are better
 assessed on the previous CT.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine are re- demonstrated.  Right humeral head prosthesis and intramedullary
 rod within the left humerus are partially visualized.  Remote healed right rib
 fractures are re- demonstrated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild right basilar atelectasis.
