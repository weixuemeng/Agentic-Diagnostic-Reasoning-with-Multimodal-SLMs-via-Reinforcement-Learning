 COMPARISON:  ___, 13:10
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the right central venous access line
 was removed. Overall, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting
 improved ventilation. This has caused the decrease in extent of the bilateral
 areas of atelectasis. However, moderate cardiomegaly persists.  No pulmonary
 edema. Normal alignment of the sternal wires.
