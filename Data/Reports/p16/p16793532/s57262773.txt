                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is mildly enlarged with left ventricular
 predominance.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in
 the lung bases, more pronounced on the right likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Degenerative changes are again seen in the thoracic spine with
 mild loss of height of several vertebral bodies, grossly unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced on the
 right, likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  Please note infection cannot be
 completely excluded, and consider repeat radiographs with improved inspiratory
 effort for better assessment of the lung bases.
