                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nausea, diarrhea, history of cirrhosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size
 appearing top normal.  Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.  There
 are streaky opacities in the lung bases with crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures, likely attributable to low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are mild degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflective of
 atelectasis.
