                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New shortness of breath and allergic rash, question consolidation.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Mild prominence of the the cardiac silhouette and upper zone vessels is noted,
 but may relate to low inspiratory volumes and AP technique.  No focal
 consolidation or gross effusion is identified.  Assessment of the neck is
 limited on these views, but there are mild c-spine degenerative changes. 
 Limited assessment of the airway is grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Borderline cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution, which is likely
 accentuated by technique.  No overt CHF.
 2) Doubt consolidation or effusion.  
 
 If additional detail is of interest, then PA and lateral views with increased
 penetration could help to better assess cardiomediastinal contours and
 vessels.
