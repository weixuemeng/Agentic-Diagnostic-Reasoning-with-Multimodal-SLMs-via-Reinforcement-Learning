                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fatigue, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were compared to previous
 exam from ___.  There has been no significant interval change. 
 Again seen is cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature.  Bibasilar opacities
 are again seen, potentially due to atelectasis or edema, however, infiltrate
 is not excluded.  There is slight blunting of the posterior costophrenic
 angles, raising possibility of trace effusions.  Cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged but stable.  Osseous structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: No significant interval change of pulmonary vascualr congestion. 
 Bibasilar opacities, potentially atelectasis or edema however developing
 infiltrates are also possible.  Clinical correlation suggested.
