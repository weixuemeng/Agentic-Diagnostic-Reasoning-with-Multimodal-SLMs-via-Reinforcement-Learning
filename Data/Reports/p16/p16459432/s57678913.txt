                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath; question congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Recent prior radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Surgical clips project over the left
 lower hemithorax, probably in the left breast.  There is moderate unfolding of
 the thoracic aorta.  The aortic arch is partly calcified.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  The right costophrenic angle is partly
 excluded posteriorly but there is no evidence for pleural effusions.  A
 widespread interstitial abnormality, somewhat more prominent on the right than
 left, appears worse than on the most recent prior radiographs and suggest
 mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  A supportive finding is the
 presence of Kerley B lines in the right cardiophrenic angle on the frontal
 view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.
