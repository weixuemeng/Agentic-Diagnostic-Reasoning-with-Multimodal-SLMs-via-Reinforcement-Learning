                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Malaise and dyspnea, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 blunting of the left CP angle with mild left basilar opacity which could
 represent atelectasis or possibly an early pneumonia.  There is mild
 cephalization suggesting mild interstitial edema.  The heart size is top
 normal.  Aorta is somewhat unfolded with atherosclerotic calcifications.  Bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial edema, top normal heart size, small left
 effusion, and basilar opacity likely atelectasis versus pneumonia.
