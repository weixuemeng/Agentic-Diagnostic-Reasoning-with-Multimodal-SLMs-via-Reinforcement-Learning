                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old female with congestive cardiac failure and
 worsening confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ frontal chest radiograph.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is increased fine reticulation within
 both lungs which may represent mild interstitial edema.  Mild increased
 opacification of the right as well as the left lung base with minimal
 silhouetting of the left medial hemidiaphragm may represent worsening edema or
 atelectasis; however, infectious process such as pneumonia cannot be excluded
 in the correct clinical setting.  Trace left-sided pleural effusion cannot be
 completely excluded.  The cardiac silhouette appears mildly prominent but not
 significantly changed from the most recent prior examination.  Mild
 cephalization of pulmonary vasculature is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Mild cardiomegaly with increased reticulation in bilateral lungs with mild
 cephalization may represent mild volume overload.  Opacification at bilateral
 lung bases may represent worsening edema versus atelectasis; however,
 infectious process is doubted but may be considered in the correct clinical
 setting.
