                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison with multiple prior studies ranging from ___ TO
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, weakness, anemia, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 hyperinflation of the lungs with upper lobe lucency, compatible with
 underlying emphysema.  There are mild Kerley B lines suggesting mild CHF. 
 Chronic opacity at the left lung base is most compatible with scarring, though
 pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  The heart size is top normal.  The
 mediastinal contour is stable with atherosclerotic calcification along the
 aortic knob.  The bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Top normal heart size with mild interstitial edema.  Stable
 opacity at the left lung base, likely chronic area of scarring given stability
 over time.
