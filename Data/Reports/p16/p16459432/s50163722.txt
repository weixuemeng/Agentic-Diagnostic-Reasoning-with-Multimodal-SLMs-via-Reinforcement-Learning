                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate a mildly enlarged
 cardiac silhouette. There are diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications of the
 aorta.  There is mild opacification of the left lung base that may represent
 an area of atelectasis.  An old compression deformity of the mid thoracic
 spine is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild left basilar atelectasis but no definite radiographic
 evidence of pneumonia.
