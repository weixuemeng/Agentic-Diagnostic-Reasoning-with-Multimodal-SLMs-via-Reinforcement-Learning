                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, pneumonia and congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and ___ as well as earlier
 radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear not
 significantly changed including mild cardiac enlargement.  There is persistent
 patchy left basilar opacity and a very small pleural effusion.  Opacification
 is perhaps increased slightly in the background of persistent left basilar
 opacity.  There is also slightly increased medial right basilar opacity,
 probably within the right lower lobe.  There is no overt congestive heart
 failure.  No pleural effusion is seen on the right.  A mild superior endplate
 compression along a lower thoracic vertebral body appears unchanged and is
 likely chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal increase in bibasilar opacities of uncertain
 significance.  This appearance may represent waxing and waning atelectasis and
 change from the prior examination is not striking; it is difficult to
 completely exclude pneumonia, however.
