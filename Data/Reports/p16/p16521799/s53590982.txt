                                 FINAL REPORT
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest view was read in comparison with
 multiple prior radiographs with the most recent from ___.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with respiratory failure, septic shock for
 evaluation of interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was read in comparison with
 multiple prior chest radiographs with the most recent from ___,
 acquired ten hours apart.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube tip is 4.8 cm from the carina lying at the level
 of the clavicles.  Consider advancing the endotracheal tube by 1 to 2 cm for
 appropriate seating.  Dual-lumen left internal jugular line ends in the left
 internal jugular vein.  Right internal jugular line tip lies approximately at
 the upper SVC.  Gastric tube courses below the diaphragm and ends into the
 stomach and is appropriate.  Over the last ___ to 11 hours, mild pulmonary
 edema has redistributed but unchanged in severity with interval improvement in
 the right lung and minimal worsening on the left side.  Increased retrocardiac
 density reflects left lower lung atelectases or due to combination of edema
 and atelectasis.  Enlarged heart size, mild mediastinal congestion and
 prominent pulmonary vasculature reflecting elevated pulmonary venous pressure
 is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Over last ___ hours, mild pulmonary edema has redistributed but
 unchanged in severity, having improved in the right lung and minimally
 worsened on left the left side
 2.  Increased retrocardiac density reflectes left lower lung atelectasis or a
 combination of edema and atelectasis is unchanged.
