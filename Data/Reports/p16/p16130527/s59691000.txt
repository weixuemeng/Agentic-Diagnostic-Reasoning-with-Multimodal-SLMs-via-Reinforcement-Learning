                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with lead terminating in the right
 ventricle.  The heart remains moderately enlarged with a left ventricular
 predominance.  There is moderate pulmonary edema, worse when compared to the
 prior exam, with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Retrocardiac opacity
 likely reflects compressive atelectasis though infection is difficult to
 exclude.  No pneumothorax is identified, though the extreme lung apices
 medially are obscured by the patient's chin projecting over this region. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate congestive heart failure, worse when compared to the prior study with
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects
 atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude.
