                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Rib pain after fall.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and several prior studies dating back to ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is moderate to severe, with in particular prominent increase in
 the left ventricle.  Tortuosity of the aorta is unchanged.  Mediastinum is
 otherwise unremarkable.
 
 Nonspecific interstitial prominence is noted with more peripheral than central
 distribution that is unlikely to represent interstitial pulmonary edema and
 most likely represents chronic pulmonary interstitial lung disease.  There is
 no appreciable pleural effusion which also would state against the presence of
 pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidations to suggest infectious process are
 noted.
