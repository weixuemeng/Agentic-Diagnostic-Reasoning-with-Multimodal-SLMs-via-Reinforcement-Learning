                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest x-rays from ___ and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Lower lung volumes seen on the current
 exam.  There is persistently increased interstitial markings throughout the
 lungs bilaterally, not significantly changed from ___.  There has
 however been interval development of more confluent opacity in the left lung
 worrisome for a superimposed infectious process thought to involve the apical
 segment of the left lower lobe.  There is no definite effusion.  Cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistently increased interstitial markings in the lungs bilaterally
 potentially due to interstitial edema or chronic underlying lung disease. 
 Superimposed new consolidation in the left lung worrisome for superimposed
 infectious process.  Recommend repeat after treatment.
