                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 931 
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cardiac amyloid, leukocytosis and crackles,
 question edema, question infiltrate.
 
 Comparison to ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 931 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A single-lead left-sided pacer remains in place with the lead terminating
 over the expected location of right ventricle.  The heart remains enlarged
 with a somewhat globular configuration which most likely reflects
 cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion should also be considered. 
 There are bilateral effusions, left much greater than the right.  There is a
 persistent patchy retrocardiac opacity with some interval improvement in
 aeration in this vicinity suggesting resolving atelectasis.  The lungs are
 otherwise grossly clear, although there is prominence of the interstitium
 which might reflect age-related changes.  There has been interval resolution
 of the interstitial edema. No pneumothorax is seen.
