                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pneumonia, amyloidosis, persistent
 ___ liter oxygen requirement, evaluate for edema or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable AP single chest
 view of ___.  Cardiomegaly as before.  Unchanged position of
 permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position connected to a single
 electrode, terminating in right ventricular apical portion as before.  The
 pulmonary vascular congestive pattern, upper zone redistribution, mild
 perivascular haze on the bases and bilateral pleural effusions blunting the
 lateral and posterior pleural sinuses before.  The on the next previous
 portable chest examination of ___ suspected parenchymal infiltrate in
 the left upper lobe lateral portion has cleared up completely.  Thus, there
 exists no remaining appreciable parenchymal pneumonic infiltrate.  It is
 unclear whether shift of pleural effusion with appearance of pneumonic
 infiltrate accounts for this change.  The present findings on the chest
 examination are similar to what has been noted on the next preceding PA and
 lateral chest examination of ___.  Thus, the findings are
 consistent with chronic left-sided heart failure, pulmonary congestion.
