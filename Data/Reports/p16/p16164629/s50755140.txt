 INDICATIONS: Cough and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A bulging contour to the left lower
 mediastinum suggests lipomatosis of the lower mediastinum as seen on the
 remote prior CT.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  Slight degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
