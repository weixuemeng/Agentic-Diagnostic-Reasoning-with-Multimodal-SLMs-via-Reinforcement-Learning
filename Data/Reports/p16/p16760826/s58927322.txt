                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Brain injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar
 and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax,
 focal consolidation, or pleural effusion.  Linear bibasilar densities are most
 compatible with atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
