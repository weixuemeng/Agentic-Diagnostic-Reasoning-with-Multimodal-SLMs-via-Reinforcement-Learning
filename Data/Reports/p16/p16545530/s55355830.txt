                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:37 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with acute ingestion.  Assess volume status.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes have improved and pulmonary vasculature has decreased, but the
 heart is still at least mildly enlarged.  Opacification at the left lung base
 is probably atelectasis.  I see no good evidence for pneumonia.  Previously
 severe gaseous and fluid distention of the stomach has improved.
