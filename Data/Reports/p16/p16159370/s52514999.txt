  1. Nodular opacity projecting over the right midlung, as seen previously and

  2. Additional subtle opacities in the right and left lower lungs which could
  represent atelectasis though the possibility of pneumonia is difficult to
  entirely exclude.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea and chest pain  // CHF or PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs most recent of which is dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a persistent nodular opacity projecting over the right mid lung
 measuring approximately ___ x 15 mm for which CT is recommended to further
 assess. In addition, there is right basal atelectasis. The possibility of
 additional nodules is difficult to entirely exclude. There is subtle opacity
 adjacent to left heart border on the frontal projection which could represent
 a prominent fat pad versus a very early pneumonia.  No large effusions are
 present. Calcified pleural plaque is noted on the lateral projection along the
 posterior pleural surface. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Nodular opacity projecting over the right mid lung, as seen previously and
 chest CT is again recommended to further assess.
 2. Additional subtle opacities in the right and left lower lungs which could
 represent atelectasis though the possibility of pneumonia is difficult to
 entirely exclude.
