                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  A small opacity in the left retrocardiac
 region could be due to atelectasis given the poor inspiratory effort, although
 in the proper clinical setting, could be due to pneumonia.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity in the setting of low lung volumes could be
 due to atelectasis or pneumonia.  If desired, a repeat lateral radiograph with
 better inspiratory effort could help further characterize the opacity. 
 Alternatively, could repeat a chest radiograph after treatment to document
 resolution.
