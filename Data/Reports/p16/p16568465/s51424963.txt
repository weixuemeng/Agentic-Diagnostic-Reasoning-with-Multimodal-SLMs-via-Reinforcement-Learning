 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with right internal jugular central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC.
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are similar with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta
 again noted. There continues to be mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Lung
 volumes are low with patchy opacities in lung bases most likely reflective of
 atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. Remote
 fracture of the right seventh posterior rib is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. 
 No pneumothorax. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis. Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
