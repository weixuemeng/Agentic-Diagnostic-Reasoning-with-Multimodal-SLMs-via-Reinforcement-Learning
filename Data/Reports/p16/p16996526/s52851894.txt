                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, crackles, evaluation for PICC line
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has made a
 substantially lesser inspiratory effort.  As a consequence, the lung volumes
 have decreased bilaterally.  In addition, crowding at both lung bases is seen.
 The lack of abnormalities on the lateral radiograph suggests that the crowding
 is the result of poor inspiration.  The PICC line shows a normal course, the
 tip of the line projects over the right atrium on today's examination, it
 could be pulled back by approximately 1-2 cm to ensure a safe position in the
 mid-to-lower SVC.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax, no pleural effusions.
