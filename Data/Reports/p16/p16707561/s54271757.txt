 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 4:30 PM
  Basilar opacity, likley on the right, potentially due to atelectasis given
  lower lung volumes on the lateral view, however infection cannot be excluded.
  Hilar and mediastinal calcified lymph nodes are compatible with treated
  lymphoma, and are not significantly changed from ___, allowing for
  difference in techniques.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with one-week history of cough, rhinorrhea and
 sore throat.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Multiple calcified lymph nodes seen in both hila and the
 mediastinum are compatible with treated lymphoma and were present in CT torso
 from ___.  Opacity projects over the lower thoracic spine on the
 lateral view, potentially localizing to the right lower lobe on the frontal. 
 Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Severe L1
 compression deformity again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Basilar opacity, likley on the right, potentially due to
 atelectasis given lower lung volumes on the lateral view, however infection
 cannot be excluded. Hilar and mediastinal calcified lymph nodes are compatible
 with treated lymphoma, and are not significantly changed from ___,
 allowing for difference in techniques.
