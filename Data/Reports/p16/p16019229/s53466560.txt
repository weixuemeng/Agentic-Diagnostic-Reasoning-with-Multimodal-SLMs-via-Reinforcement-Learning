                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with fluid overload and history of
 necrotizing pancreatitis.  Study requested for evaluation of pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has
 been interval increase of bilateral diffuse opacities, worse in the upper
 lobes.  There is evidence of a dilated azygos vein. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased bilateral diffuse opacities, worse in the upper lobes
 which likely represent asymmetric edema related to position; alternatively,
 these findings could be related to concurrent pneumonia. Depending upon
 clinical circumstances, these findings could also represent pulmonary
 hemorrhage.
