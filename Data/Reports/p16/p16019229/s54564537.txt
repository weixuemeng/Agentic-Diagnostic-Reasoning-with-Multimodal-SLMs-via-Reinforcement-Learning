                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left pigtail pull, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of earlier in this date, the left pigtail
 catheter has been removed and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Diffuse
 bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist and there are somewhat lower lung
 volumes.
