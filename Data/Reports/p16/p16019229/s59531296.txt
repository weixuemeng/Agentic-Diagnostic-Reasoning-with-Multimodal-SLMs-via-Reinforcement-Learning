                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pancreatitis and pancreatic thoracic
 fistula, now with hypotension and concern for possible pneumoperitoneum.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from earlier the same
 day, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single upright frontal image of the chest again demonstrates a
 large amount of gas overlying the mid upper abdomen, which may represent
 extensive stomach distention or pneumoperitoneum.  Given the urgency of these
 findings, it is recommended that the patient have an NG tube placed for
 stomach decompression and then it is recommended that a repeat upright chest
 radiograph be obtained to rule out pneumoperitoneum.  There are no cardiac or
 pulmonary changes since the prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large amount of air continues to overlie the abdomen and could
 represent distended stomach or possibly pneumoperitoneum.  Recommend urgent
 placement of an NG tube for stomach decompression followed by urgent upright
 chest radiograph to rule out possible pneumoperitoneum.  Otherwise, unchanged
 pulmonary and cardiac findings.
 
 These findings were made at 11:45 a.m. on ___ and were
 communicated to Dr. ___ at 11:46 a.m. on ___ by
 telephone.
