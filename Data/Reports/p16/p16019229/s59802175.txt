                                 FINAL REPORT

 Left pigtail catheter has been pulled back.  There is less catheter inside the
 pleural space and there is less looping of the catheter at the tip.  Extensive
 multifocal bilateral pneumonia is unchanged.  Other lines are tubes are in
 unchanged position.  Right chest tube is new.  There is no evident
 pneumothorax.  The small right pleural effusion has improved.
