                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:41 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fungal pneumonia.  Chest tube placed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 I see no radiopaque thoracostomy tube.  Small bore pleural catheter could be
 present but not readily visible.
 
 Elevation of the right lung base, due in part to subpulmonic pleural effusion,
 reflected in moderate-to-severe atelectasis is unchanged. Left perihilar
 consolidation which improved after ___ has improved again.  I suspect
 this was originally pneumonia, and now is a combination of residual pneumonia
 and edema in a region of damaged lung.  There is no appreciable edema in the
 right lung.  Widening of the mediastinum is due in part to venous engorgement.
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion
 is also stable.  Right jugular line ends in the region of the superior
 cavoatrial junction and a feeding tube passes to the distal stomach and out of
 view.  Upper abdominal drain is barely visible, and cannot be localized on
 this single frontal view.  No pneumothorax.
