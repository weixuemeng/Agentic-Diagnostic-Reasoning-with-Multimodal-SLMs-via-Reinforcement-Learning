                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pancreatitis and pancreatic-thoracic
 fistula, now with hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 from earlier the same day, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal image of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes,
 likely related to poor inspiration.  There are again seen bilateral pleural
 effusions, which are unchanged from imaging earlier the same day.  Bilateral
 chest tubes are again seen.  The lungs are essentially unchanged from earlier
 imaging.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from previous imaging.
 PICC line is noted to be in the same position as on prior exam.  Of note,
 there is a large area of gas noted overlying the abdomen, which could
 represent a very distended stomach or possibly a pneumoperitoneum.  Given the
 potential urgency of this finding, a follow up true upright PA and lateral
 radiographs are recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged pulmonary and cardiac findings.  Large amount of air
 overlying the abdomen, which could represent a distended stomach or possibly
 pneumoperitoneum.  Recommend urgent true upright PA and lateral imaging or, if
 this is not possible, lateral decubitus position imaging.
 
 These findings were made at 10:56 a.m. on ___ and were
 communicated to Dr. ___ at 10:59 a.m. on ___ by
 telephone.
