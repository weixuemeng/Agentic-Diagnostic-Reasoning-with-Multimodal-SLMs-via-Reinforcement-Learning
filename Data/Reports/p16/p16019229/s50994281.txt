                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  PICC line re-positioned, establish new position.
 
 CHEST:  The tip of the PICC line lies in a similar position as it was on the
 prior occasion with the tip pointing cephalad near the junction of the
 subclavian and right IJ.  The vascularity is somewhat increased in all areas
 suggesting a failure with some mild clearing of the interstitial alveolar
 opacities in the left lobe but now a more diffuse pattern being present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PICC line still incorrectly placed.  Changing patten of likely
 failure.
