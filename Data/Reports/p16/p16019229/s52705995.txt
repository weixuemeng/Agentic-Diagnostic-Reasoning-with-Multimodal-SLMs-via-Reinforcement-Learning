                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Known bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from a recent chest CT performed on ___, which showed no pleural effusions at that time.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac contour is accordingly
 difficult to assess, also given a large right-sided pleural effusion and a
 moderate to large left-sided one.  Parenchymal opacification is probably
 associated with associated volume loss and atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions.
