 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fluid overload, status post sepsis, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The lung volumes remain low, monitoring and support devices are in
 constant position.  The bilateral pleural fluid collections are unchanged. 
 The retrocardiac lung areas have slightly increased in transparency, likely
 reflecting improved ventilation.  No new parenchymal opacities.
