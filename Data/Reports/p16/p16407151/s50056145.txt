                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with prior intubation
 history with surgical bleeding after Whipple.
  
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.  
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 3.4 cm above the carina.  The right internal
 jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC.  Heart size and mediastinum
 are unchanged in appearance as well as widespread consolidations, right hilar
 enlargement and partial right middle lobe atelectasis.  Overall, the findings
 are new after the surgery and were not seen on the pre-surgical examination,
 that is most likely consistent with atelectasis and unlikely to represent
 neoplasms.
