 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital pre-op film from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube is at the orifice of the right
 main bronchus and needs to be pulled back by approximately 2 to 3 cm.  The
 course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not
 included in the film.  The lung volumes have overall decreased.  There are
 areas of atelectasis at the right lung bases in the retrocardiac lung areas. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with minimal fluid overload.  No pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.
