  Right pulmonary opacity worrisome for extensive aspiration given clinical
  history of overdose, versus asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Given that the
  patient is upright, layering pleural effusion is less likely.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia  // ?pnuemonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacity projecting over the right lung is worrisome for pneumonia, aspiration
 given clinical history of overdose, versus asymmetric pulmonary edema. 
 Although could theoretically also be due to a layering pleural effusion if the
 patient is not fully upright.  The left lung is clear.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right pulmonary opacity worrisome for aspiration given clinical history of
 overdose, versus asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Given that the patient is
 upright, layering pleural effusion is less likely.
