                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of positive PPD.  Rule out
 evidence of TB.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. There is a
 focal density in the right juxtahilar region, best seen on lateral radiograph
 overlying the heart, which likely represents a juxtahilar nodule. Lungs are
 otherwise clear with no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right juxtahilar nodule.  In the absence of prior imaging,
 further evaluation is recommended with a chest CT.
