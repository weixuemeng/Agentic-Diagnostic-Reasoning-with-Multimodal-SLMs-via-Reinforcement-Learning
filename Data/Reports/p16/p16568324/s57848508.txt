                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with endotracheal tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.9 cm from the carina. An
 enteric tube tip is noted within the distal esophagus.  Heart size is top
 normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature
 is normal. Minimal streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen on this supine
 exam. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 2. Enteric tube tip within the distal esophagus and should be advanced by at
 least 15 cm for appropriate positioning.
 3. Probable mild bibasilar atelectasis.
