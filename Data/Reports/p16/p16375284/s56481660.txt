                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  New-onset seizure, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest are provided.  There is
 linear density in the right mid-to-lower lung which is most compatible with
 subsegmental atelectasis.  Lungs are otherwise clear without focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal contours
 appear normal.  Bony structures are intact.
