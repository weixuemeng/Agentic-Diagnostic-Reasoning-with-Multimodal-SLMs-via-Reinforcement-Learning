                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p chest tube  // chest tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided chest drains in situ.  The right apical lateral pneumothorax
 measuring 20 mm in diameter is unchanged in size compared to prior radiograph,
 but appears to be filled with fluid.  Increased density seen in the right
 cardiophrenic angle. The second density just superior to this may be loculated
 pleural fluid collection, but is difficult on a single AP radiograph. 
 Transverse cardiomegaly unchanged.  Persistent left lower lobe consolidation
 with bronchograms seen within.  No pulmonary edema.  No large effusions. 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath in situ with the tip at the cavoatrial junction. 
 Subcutaneous gas seen in the right chest wall and right supraclavicular area.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The right apical lateral pneumothorax is unchanged in size, but now appears to
 be filled with fluid.
 
 The opacification the right cardiophrenic angle is presumed to be partial
 right middle lobe collapse.
 I am unsure what the density above this represents on a single AP radiograph.
 
 Consolidation of the left lower lobe which may represent atelectasis or
 pneumonia.
