                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o F with PMHx of DLBCL s/p chemotherapy (___) who was
 found to have a R pleural effusion for which she underwent medical
 thoracoscopy with TPC placement on ___, requested for IP for CT removal 
 // r/o any abnl
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip lies near the cavoatrial
 junction.  2 separate tubes overlie the right lung base, similar to prior.
 
 The possibility of a small residual right apical pneumothorax cannot be
 excluded.  The prior study raise the possibility that there was fluid
 associated with the pleural space in this area.  Subcutaneous emphysema in the
 right supraclavicular fossae, extending into the right lower neck, is similar
 to the prior film.
 
 There is cardiomegaly, similar to prior.  The previous right cardiophrenic
 opacity has improved.  A small right pleural effusion  is now visible. 
 Ppacity Retrocardiac opacity is again seen, slightly more pronounced.  Doubt
 CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Complex appearance at the right lung apex makes it difficult to exclude a
 small pneumothorax.  No evidence for a large pneumothorax.
 
 Right cardiophrenic opacity has is markedly improved.
 
 Retrocardiac opacity is slightly more pronounced.
 
 Small right effusion is new.
