                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with DLBCL w/ R pleural effusion s/p
 pleurodesis w/ Pleurx catheter placement.  // Please evaluate pleurx
 placement.     Please evaluate pleurx placement.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the large the chest tube has been
 removed and replaced with a PleurX catheter that coils in the lower portion of
 the right hemithorax.  The large opacity in the right mid zone has
 substantially cleared.  Increased opacification at the right base is
 consistent with pleural fluid and atelectasis and there is subcutaneous gas
 along the lower chest wall.  An air-fluid level in the right apex suggests
 loculated region of hydro pneumothorax.  Apical pleural capping is again seen.
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with left basilar
 opacification consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in all left lower
 lobe.  Probable mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
