 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with sarcoid, type 2 diabetes, and
 hypertension who presents with chest pain over the left breast.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes, as noted previously.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged and normal in size.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There is
 no visible osseous abnormality on the frontal view.  Note is again made of
 multilevel degenerative change of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes, without acute chest pathology.
 
 2.  No osseous lesion identified.  If there is continued clinical concern,
 recommend repeat dedicated rib radiographs with a BB marker to indicate the
 site of the patient's pain.
