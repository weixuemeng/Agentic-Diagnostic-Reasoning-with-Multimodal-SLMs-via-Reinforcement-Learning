                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recent pneumonia, assess for improvement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small irregular opacity in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe is
 improving, as is a region of peribronchial infiltration in the left lower lobe
 seen on the lateral view projecting over the thoracic spine.  I would like to
 see the left upper lobe lesion clear further or at least stabilized, and
 therefore I would recommend that the patient return in four to six weeks for
 repeat chest radiograph.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  There is no pulmonary vascular abnormality or
 pleural effusion.
