                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with recent history of pneumonia, presents with
 bilateral rhonchi.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent chest radiographs from outside hospital are not
 available.  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously documented residual retrocardiac opacity has improved
 but still present with moderately crowded appearance of pulmonary vasculature
 consistent with atelectasis.  There is a new hazy infiltrate in the left
 anterior upper lobe and lingula, compatible with acute infection; followup
 after treatment is recommended.  The heart is upper normal in size with
 relative prominence of the left ventricl which, along with aortic elongation,
 is suggestive of systemic hypertension.  However, there is no evidence of
 pulmonary congestion or other evidence of heart failure.  There is no pleural
 effusion, focal consolidation or evidence of pneumothorax.  The pleural
 surfaces are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hazy infiltrate in the left anterior upper lobe and lingula
 compatible with acute infection.  Recommendation is made to followup after
 treatment.
