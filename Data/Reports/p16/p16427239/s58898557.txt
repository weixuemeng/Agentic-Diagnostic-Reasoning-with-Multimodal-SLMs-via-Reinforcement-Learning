                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___:
 
 HISTORY:  Assess for resolution of left upper lobe pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Compared to ___, the region of heterogeneous opacification in the left
 lower lobe has cleared entirely.  The smaller region of abnormality in the
 anterior segment of the left upper lobe continues to clear but has not
 resolved entirely.  Given the progress, it would be reasonable to follow this
 abnormality radiographically with another set of chest radiographs in six
 weeks.  Right lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or evidence of
 central adenopathy and the heart size is normal.
