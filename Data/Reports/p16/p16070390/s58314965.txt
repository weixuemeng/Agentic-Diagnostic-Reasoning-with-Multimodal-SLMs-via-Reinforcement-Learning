                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hx of bronchitis, multiple PNA now with
 new hypoxia  // PNA, pulmonary effusion, COPD
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased.  This
 decrease causes crowding of the vascular and bronchial structures, notably at
 the right lung base. However, there is additional increase in radiodensity in
 this lung region, potentially consistent with a small right pleural effusion. 
 A coexisting subtle pneumonia cannot be excluded without lateral radiograph.
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Minimal tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta. Small scars and calcified granulomas in the lung apices are constant as
 compared to the previous image.
