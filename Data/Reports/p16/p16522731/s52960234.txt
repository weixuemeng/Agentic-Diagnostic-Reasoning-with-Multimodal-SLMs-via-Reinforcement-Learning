                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever, cough and shortness of breath for one month.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___ (outside study).
 
 Heart size is enlarged in part due to pericardial effusion, better seen on the
 recent chest CT.  Left pleural effusion is small to moderate, associated with
 mild atelectasis.  Extensive mediastinal lipomatosis is present as well as
 mediastinal lymph nodes again better appreciated on the chest CT.  Fullness in
 the right hilum is demonstrated and might be corresponding to impacted
 bronchiectasis, primarily seen in the right middle lobe and anterior segment
 of the right upper lobe.  In the absence of administration of IV contrast, the
 etiology is unclear and correlation with bronchoscopy to exclude the
 possibility of tracheal bronchus is recommended.
