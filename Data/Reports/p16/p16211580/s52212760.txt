 Hilar hand mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is upper zone
 redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. There is mild patchy opacity in
 the right cardiophrenic region, slightly more pronounced than on the prior
 film. There is minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. Possible blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle, but no gross effusion on either side.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiomegaly, probably unchanged.
 2. Upper zone redistribution without other evidence of CHF.
 3. Patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is slightly more
 pronounced than on ___, albeit likely accentuated by technical
