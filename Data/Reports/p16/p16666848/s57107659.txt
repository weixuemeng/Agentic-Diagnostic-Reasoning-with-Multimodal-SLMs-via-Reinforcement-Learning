                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and bilateral hilar enlargement
 are consistent with lymph node enlargement related to known CLL.  They appear
 unchanged since the prior radiograph.  Patchy and linear opacities have
 developed at both lung bases, as well as an apparent nodular opacity in the
 left mid-to-lower lung region at the level of the fifth anterior rib at the
 intersection with the ninth posterior rib.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are new, left greater than right.  No acute skeletal abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Questionable left lung nodule versus superimposition of normal structures.
 Considering history of neutropenic fever, ___-degree shallow oblique
 radiographs or CT may be helpful to further evaluate this region to exclude
 the possibility of a fungal infection if warranted clinically.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
 3.  Mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement, consistent with known
 history of CLL.
 
 Findings and recommendation discussed by phone with Dr. ___ on ___ at
 10:45 am at the time of discovery.
