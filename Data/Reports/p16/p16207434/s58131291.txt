                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged with similar postradiation paramediastinal
 changes.  Mild atelectasis is noted within the right lung base.  The left lung
 is clear.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle posteriorly is unchanged,
 and likely reflects chronic pleural thickening.  No pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Chronic elevation of the right right
 hemidiaphragm and unchanged blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus
 suggestive of chronic pleural thickening.
