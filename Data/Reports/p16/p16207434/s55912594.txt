                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Clinical signs of aspiration. Review of OMR indicates a history of
 lymphoma. 
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.  
 
 There is rotated positioning.  The right hemidiaphragm is considerably
 elevated, which obscures the right heart border. Allowing for this, there is
 probable cardiomegaly, which does not appear significantly changed from
 ___.  The aorta is unfolded, as before.  There is mild upper zone
 redistribution.  No obvious focal infiltrate is identified. No left-sided
 effusion.  Minimal atelectasis at the left base and at the right base
 medially, allowing for the elevated right hemidiaphragm.  No superimposed
 right effusion is identified.  Curvilinear lucency along the upper left chest
 wall is thought to reflect the presence of a skin fold.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Possible mild vascular plethora.  Otherwise, no gross change compared with
 ___.  
 2.  No focal infiltrate to confirm the presence of aspiration.
 3.  Targeted review of a CT from ___ shows eventration of the
 liver above the level of the diaphragm into the inferior right chest,
 accounting for the elevated hemidiaphragm seen on today's CXR.
