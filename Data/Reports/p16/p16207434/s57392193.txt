                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 10:12 A.M. 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cough, hypotension, question
 infiltrate.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 116.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 10:12 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The left lung remains clear.  There is persistent elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  However, on the current examination, there is a suggestion of
 at least layering pleural fluid on the right, some of which may be
 subpulmonic.  A mass or infection in the right lower lung cannot be excluded. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable with exception of the right heart
 border which is obscured.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Given the
 patient's symptoms, further imaging evaluation with CT may be helpful to
 further elucidate the findings at the right lung base.
