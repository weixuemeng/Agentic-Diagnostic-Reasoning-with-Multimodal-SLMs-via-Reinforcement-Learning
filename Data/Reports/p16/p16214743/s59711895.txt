                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and rigors with hypoxemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Two views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are low in volume
 but appear clear aside from subtly increased interstitial markings which could
 reflect an atypical infectious process.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles
 on the frontal view is likely due to overlying soft tissue given their
 sharpness on the lateral.  The heart is mildly enlarged with tortuous thoracic
 aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION: Reticular interstitial prominence could reflect an atypical
 infectious process.
