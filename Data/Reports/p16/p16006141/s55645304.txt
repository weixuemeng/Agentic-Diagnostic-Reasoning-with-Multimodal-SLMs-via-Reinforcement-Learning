                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  GI bleed with intubation and increasing infiltrates on chest x-ray,
 question infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube has
 been removed.  The right IJ catheter again extends to the lower portion of the
 SVC.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The right hemidiaphragm is now sharply seen.  The
 left hemidiaphragm is obscured, consistent with atelectasis and small
 effusion.
 
 It is difficult to exclude supervening basilar consolidation in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
