                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Left lung opacities seen on cervical spine CT.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. CT cervical spine performed
 earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with single lead terminating in the right
 ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The aorta is mildly
 tortuous and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications particularly at the
 knob.  Hazy ill-defined opacities are noted within the left upper lobe.  The
 right lung is grossly clear, and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Degenerative changes of both acromioclavicular joints are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left upper lobe hazy opacity is concerning for pneumonia or aspiration,
 although asymmetric pulmonary edema may also be present, particularly given
 the presence of smooth septal thickening on the prior CT of the cervical
 spine.
