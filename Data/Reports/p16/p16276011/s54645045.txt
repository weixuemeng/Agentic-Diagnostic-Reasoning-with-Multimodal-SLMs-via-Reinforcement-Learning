 r/o PNA

 right apical fluid is not excluded. No evidence of pleural effusion elsewhere.
 No pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.

 Large area of right upper lobe opacity/ consolidation may be due to pneumonia.
 Pulmonary hemorrhage or component of aspiration would also be in the
