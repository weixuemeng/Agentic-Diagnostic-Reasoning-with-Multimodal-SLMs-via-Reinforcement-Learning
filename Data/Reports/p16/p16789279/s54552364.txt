                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ARDS ___ PCP with acute worsening of
 ventilatory status  // ?ETT placement, acute change in lung parenchyma
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased,
 potentially reflecting improved ventilation or increased ventilatory
 pressures.  As a consequence, the extent and severity of the pre-existing
 parenchymal opacities has minimally decreased. Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette. Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis.  Unchanged monitoring and
 support devices.
