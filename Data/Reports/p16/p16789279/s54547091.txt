 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pjp pna, worsening  // interval chsange     
 interval chsange
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 22:10
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The diffuse bilateral consolidative airspace process has slightly worsened and
 is concerning for severe pulmonary edema or diffuse pneumonia, less likely
 pulmonary hemorrhage. Clinical correlation is advised.  The overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the diffuse airspace
 process but are likely not changed. No pneumothorax. No pleural effusions.
