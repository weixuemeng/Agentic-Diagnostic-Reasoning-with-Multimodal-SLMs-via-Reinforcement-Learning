 change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, accentuating cardiomediastinal contours and
 bronchovascular structures. Interval apparent worsening of widespread
 bilateral airspace opacities could in part be due to lower lung volumes, but
 may also reflect worsening pneumocystis pneumonia, with or without coexisting
 edema.  Small to moderate pleural effusion has slightly increased in size.
