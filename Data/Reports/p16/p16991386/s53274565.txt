                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Hemothorax.  Chest tube placed.  Has hemothorax been drained.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 The elevation of the right lung base due at least in part to pleural effusion
 has not changed appreciably since ___.  To what extent the appearance is
 due to elevation of the diaphragm is radiographically indeterminate, but it
 was very high on the torso CT performed ___.  Best way of determining
 fluid collections either above or below the diaphragm is ultrasound.  I think
 there is still a moderate volume of pleural air at the apex of the right
 hemithorax extending medially toward the mediastinum and right hilus.  The
 pleural tube has migrated somewhat peripherally and now most proximal side
 port may be extrathoracic which would account for the persistence of
 subcutaneous emphysema in the right axilla.  Volume of the left lung is low,
 but there is no focal atelectasis.  Mild-to-moderate enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Left pleural effusion
 is small.  There is no left pneumothorax.
