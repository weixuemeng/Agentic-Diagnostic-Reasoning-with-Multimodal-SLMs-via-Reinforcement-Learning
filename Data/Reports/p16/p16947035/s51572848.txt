 HISTORY:  Status post chest tube removal.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi erect portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and preoperative chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The patient has been extubated in the interim.  The NG tube,
 mediastinal drains and a left-sided chest tube has been removed.  Epicardial
 pacing wires are again noted.  A right internal jugular catheter terminates in
 the distal SVC.  
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may reflect
 atelectasis.  There is no focal airspace consolidation.  An evolving
 postoperative appearance of the mediastinum is noted.  The heart is normal in
 size.  The stomach is distended and elevates the left hemi-diaphragm. 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. No pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
 2. Distended stomach elevating the diaphragm after NGT removal.
