                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever, recent trt malaria. Pneumonia? edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, there is a pulmonary opacification over the
 lower thoracic spine, not definitely seen on the frontal view.  This suggests
 the presence of a posterior lower lobe pneumonia.  There is also blunting of
 the bilateral costophrenic angles, suggesting effusion.  The heart,
 mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable compared to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New opacification in the posterior lower lung on the lateral view, not
 seen on the PA view, is consistent with a posterior lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 2. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
