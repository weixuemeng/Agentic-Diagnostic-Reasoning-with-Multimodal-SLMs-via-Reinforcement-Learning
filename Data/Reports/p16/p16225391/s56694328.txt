                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post left thoracotomy and left upper lobe
 resection, with stable postoperative appearance of the left hemithorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged since prior postoperative
 studies, and no new pulmonary nodules or masses are evident in either lung. 
 There are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable postoperative appearance of the chest with no findings to
 suggest local recurrence or pulmonary metastases.  If there is high clinical
 suspicion for recurrence, CT would be more sensitive and may be considered if
 warranted clinically.
