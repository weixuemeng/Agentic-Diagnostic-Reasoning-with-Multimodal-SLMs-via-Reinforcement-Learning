                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is unfolded.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are relatively unchanged with fullness of the right hilum
 again be demonstrated.  There is hyperinflation of the lungs with attenuation
 the pulmonary vascular markings towards the lung apices compatible with
 underlying emphysema.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities are noted which
 appear slightly progressed in the interval, likely reflecting areas of
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are
 mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Progressive streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflective of worsening
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation.  Emphysema.
