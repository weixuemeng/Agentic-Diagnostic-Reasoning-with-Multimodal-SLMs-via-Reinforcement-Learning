 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 00:54 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there are newly appeared
 bilateral areas of basal opacities.  The distribution of these opacities
 suggests atelectasis.  The lung volumes have overall slightly decreased.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Unchanged size
 of the cardiac silhouette.
