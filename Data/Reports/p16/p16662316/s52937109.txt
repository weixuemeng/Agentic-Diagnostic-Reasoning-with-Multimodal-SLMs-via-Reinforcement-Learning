                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia, previous pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle streaky opacities in the left mid-to-lower lung most
 likely represent atelectasis/scarring as well as at the right lung base. 
 However, in the appropriate clinical setting, infectious process is not
 excluded.  Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further
 evaluation.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  The hilar
 contours are stable.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is no evidence of large
 pleural effusion.
