                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation.  Allowing for this
 limitation, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged,
 with the heart size within normal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Subsegmental atelectasis in the right lung base is present.  Remote bilateral
 rib fractures present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Somewhat limited exam, but no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
