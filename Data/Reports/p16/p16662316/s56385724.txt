 HISTORY:  Recent hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis or aspiration, infection
 not entirely excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms consistent with
 COPD.  Relative lucency involving the upper lobes consistent with patient's
 known pulmonary emphysema.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable
 and unremarkable.  There is stable mild anterior wedging of a lower thoracic
 vertebral body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis or aspiration, infectious
 process not entirely excluded.
 
 COPD/pulmonary emphysema.
