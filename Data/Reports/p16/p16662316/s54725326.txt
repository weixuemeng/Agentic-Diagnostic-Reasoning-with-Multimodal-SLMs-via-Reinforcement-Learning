                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Alcoholism, hypoxemia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size remains top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  There has
 been interval improvement in aeration of the right lung base, with residual
 linear opacities likely reflective of atelectasis.  Within the left lung base,
 there are persistent patchy and streaky airspace opacities, slightly worse in
 the interval.  This could reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration
 is not excluded.  Lungs remain hyperinflated.  No significant pleural effusion
 is demonstrated, and there is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 are detected.  Mild loss of height anteriorly of a lower thoracic vertebral
 body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar patchy and streaky opacity appears slightly worse in the
 interval, possibly atelectasis though infection or aspiration is not excluded.
 Interval improvement in aeration of the right lung base with residual
 atelectasis.
