 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  hypoxia, question infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There

 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  External artifact is seen
 projecting over the medial lung fields.

 concerning for infection and/or aspiration.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm and right base atelectasis.
