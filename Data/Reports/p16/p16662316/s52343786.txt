                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest CT and ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged
 and within normal limits.  Right middle lobe collapse appears worse when
 compared to the prior chest radiograph when there was partial collapse, but
 appears similar compared to the prior chest CT.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 not engorged.  The left lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected.  Old bilateral rib fractures are again noted.  Emphysematous changes
 are again seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Recurrent right middle lobe collapse.  Correlation with bronchoscopy or
 contrast-enhanced chest CT is again recommended for further assessment.
