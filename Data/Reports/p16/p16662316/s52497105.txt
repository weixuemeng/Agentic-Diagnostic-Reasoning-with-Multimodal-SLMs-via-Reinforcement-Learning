                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  COPD, presenting with shortness of breath for one day.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 is flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  Bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  Additional right base patchy opacity
 is seen, which could relate to atelectasis, although underlying infection or
 aspiration may be present.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The mediastinum is unremarkable.  Hilar
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar opacities, likely due to atelectasis, increased right base
 opacity may be due to atelectasis, although underlying infection or aspiration
 is not excluded.
 2.  COPD.
