                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  History of COPD.  Presents with hypoxia.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of one hour
 prior.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: Compared to the prior film there
 is slight increased heterogeneous parenchymal abnormality.  Lingular opacity
 is unchanged.  Mild vascular congestion is also relatively unchanged.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  There are old right rib
 deformities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Compared to the prior film there is possibly increased
 heterogeneous parenchymal abnormality that remains concerning for atypical
 pneumonia or early heart failure.
