                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, latest one on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperexpanded with flattening of the diaphragm
 suggesting emphysema. Streaky linear opacities in the right middle lobe are
 seen suggestive of atelectasis. No other focal opacities are present. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  Old fracture of a lower right rib
 is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacities in the right middle lobe on a background of
 emphysema suggesting atelectasis but an early infectious process cannot be
 excluded. Correlate clinically.
