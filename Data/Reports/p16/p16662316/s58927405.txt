                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Exam is limited secondary to patient positioning as he
 could not cooperate for the examination.  Again seen is streaky left basilar
 opacity in the retrocardiac region, not significantly changed.  Minimal right
 basilar opacity is also seen, not significantly changed.  Superiorly, the
 lungs are grossly clear.  Given differences in positioning and technique,
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Osseous structures are grossly
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  Limited exam with streaky left
 basilar greater than right basilar opacities, potentially atelectasis,
 infection or aspiration not excluded.
