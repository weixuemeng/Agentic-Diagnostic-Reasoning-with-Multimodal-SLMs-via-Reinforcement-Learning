                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cough and wheezing, question pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild hyperinflation suggests emphysema or small airways
 obstruction.  Segmental collapse in the right middle lobe is best appreciated
 on the lateral view, but also lends hazy opacification to the right mid lung
 on the frontal.  Atelectasis has been present to some degree in the middle
 lobe since at least ___, when the patient also had mild cardiac
 decompensation.  Presumably, it is a function of bronchospasm, but if it does
 not clear, CT scanning would be indicated to exclude a small endobronchial
 lesion.  Heart size is normal today.  There is no pleural effusion.
