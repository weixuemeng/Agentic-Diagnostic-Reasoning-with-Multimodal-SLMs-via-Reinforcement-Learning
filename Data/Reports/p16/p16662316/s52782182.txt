                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, not moving good air on exam.  History of recurrent pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Lungs remain hyperinflated
 with attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings within the lung apices
 compatible with underlying emphysema.  Streaky airspace opacities are noted in
 the lung bases, which appears progressed when compared to the prior study
 within the left lung base.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky airspace opacities within the lung bases, slightly worse in the left
 lung base when compared to the prior study.  These could reflect areas of
 bibasilar atelectasis but infection particularly in the left lung base cannot
 be excluded.  Emphysema.
