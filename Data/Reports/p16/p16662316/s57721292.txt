 Emphysematous changes are re- demonstrated.  The lung volumes are decreased
 compared to the prior study.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Old bilateral rib fractures are again noted.

 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Emphysema.
