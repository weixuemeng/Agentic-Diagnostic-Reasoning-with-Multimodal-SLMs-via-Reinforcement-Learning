 persistent linear scarring or atelectasis within the right middle lobe.  The
 previously seen left basilar atelectasis is improved.  There is no evidence of
 new focal opacity since the prior study.  Bilateral healing rib fractures are
 again present.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
