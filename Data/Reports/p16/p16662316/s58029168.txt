                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph frontal lateral views.
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, intoxication.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.  This may account for slight leftward
 positioning of the cardiac silhouette.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 including its positioning, is unchanged.
 
 There is probable background hyperinflation.  Again seen is a  junction line
 traversing the midline, unchanged.
 
 There is minimal patchy opacity at both lung bases on the frontal view and a
 band of opacity projecting over the lung on the lateral view.  No frank
 consolidation or effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures demonstrates an old healed
 lateral nondisplaced ninth rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Hyperinflated lungs consistent with COPD.
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite pneumonic infiltrate.
 2.  Linear band projecting over the cardiac silhouette on the lateral view. 
 The appearance is suggestive of recurrent collapse involving the lingula.  The
 etiology for this remains unclear.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were conveyed by Dr. ___ with ED QA nurses via
 email on ___ at 10:12 AM.
