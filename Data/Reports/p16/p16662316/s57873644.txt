                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, oxygen saturation at 89%.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged and within normal limits.  Continued right middle lobe
 opacification appears similar when compared to prior study, and remains
 concerning for pneumonia.  Streaky linear opacities in the left lobe have
 improved, and likely reflect improving pneumonia with residual atelectasis. 
 No new areas of consolidation are present, there is no pneumothorax. 
 Previously noted tiny pleural effusions appear likely resolved.  There are
 multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Continued right middle lobe opacification concerning for pneumonia.  As
 the findings appear similar when compared to prior study, chest CT should be
 obtained to evaluate for the presence of an obstructing central or
 endobronchial lesion.
 2.  Improved aeration of the left lower lobe with residual linear opacities
 which may be reflective of atelectasis.
