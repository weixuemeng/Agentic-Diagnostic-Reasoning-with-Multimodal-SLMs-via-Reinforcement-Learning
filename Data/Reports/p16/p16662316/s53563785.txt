                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of pneumonia and  right middle lobe
 collapse presents with weakness, cough, subjective fevers.  Assess for
 interval changes compared to previous chest x-ray, particularly in regards to
 new or worsening pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph from ___, CT chest
 without contrast from ___, multiple PA and lateral radiographs,
 most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is chronic collapse of the right middle lobe.  Findings
 are in the setting of flattened hemidiaphragms and generalized increased
 markings most consistent with COPD.  This raises the concern for an extrinsic
 mass causing obstruction and subsequent volume loss. There is atelectasis at
 the left base but no no definite focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic right middle lobe atelectasis in the setting of COPD is
 suspicious for malignancy.  Recommend direct visualization with bronchoscopy.
 
 These findings were discussed with ___ by Dr. ___ at 1:58
 p.m.
