                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxia, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is no lobar
 consolidation or convincing signs of pneumonia.  There are linear densities in
 the lower lungs likely compatible with atelectasis.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly
 stable.  Apparent enlargement of the pulmonary arteries could reflect
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.  No pneumothorax is seen.
