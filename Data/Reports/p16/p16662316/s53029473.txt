                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of COPD presenting with cough and
 shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated which slightly limits assessment.  Allowing for this,
 the heart size is grossly normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly
 unremarkable.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are hyperinflated with
 flattening of the diaphragms compatible with COPD. Mild compression deformity
 of a low thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. COPD.
