 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  Streaky
 opacities in lung bases most likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are mild
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  Remote right-sided rib fracture
 is noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
