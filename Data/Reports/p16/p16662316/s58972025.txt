                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, cough, chest pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates hyperaerated
 lungs with relative lucencies of the upper lobes suggesting emphysema. There
 is an appearance of impproved aeration of the right lung base; however, the
 minor fissure is not well seen and it is unclear if change reflects slightly
 worsened chronic right middle lobe collapse no longer obscuring evaluation of
 the right lower lung or improved collapse. Residual streaky opacification
 within the left lung base is consistent with atelectasis.  No focal
 opacification concerning for pneumonia present.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process. Chronic bibasilar atelectasis.
 Background emphysema.
