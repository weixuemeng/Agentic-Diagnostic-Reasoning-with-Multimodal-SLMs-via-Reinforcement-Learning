 shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.

 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size
 within normal limits.  Lungs remain hyperinflated with mild emphysematous
 changes most pronounced in the apices.  Scattered linear opacities are noted
 within the lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are mild
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. Remote bilateral rib fractures are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis and mild
 emphysema.
