                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back through ___, including
 most recent study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There is collapse
 of the right middle lobe.  There is also minimal left lower lung atelectasis. 
 The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles could be
 due to trace pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Healed bilateral
 rib fractures are redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right middle lobe collapse.
 
 2. No focal consolidation.
 
 3. Possible trace pleural effusions.
