                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of the patient found down.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Previously visualized faint opacity at the right lower lobe has
 increased significantly, raises suspicion for an infectious process at the
 right lower lobe, possibly due to aspiration.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 remains stable.  The lungs remain hyperinflated consistent with the patient's
 known history of emphysema.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  No acute
 fractures are identified. Deformity of the posterolateral right 9th rib is
 unchanged compared with ___ and likely represents an old healed fracture. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Previously noted faint opacity at the right lung base has
 significantly increased in size and is concerning for an infectious process,
 possibly due to aspiration.  Continued followup is recommended.
