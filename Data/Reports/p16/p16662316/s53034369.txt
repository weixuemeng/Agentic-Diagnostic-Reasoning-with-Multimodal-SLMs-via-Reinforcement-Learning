                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The patient
 is rotated.  Bilateral right greater than left lower lobar opacities are re-
 demonstrated and in the setting of infectious symptoms multifocal pneumonia
 remains a consideration although aspiration or atelectasis may be present.
 Multiple old rib fractures are demonstrated on the left.  The heart and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities could represent multifocal pneumonia,
 aspiration or atelectasis.
