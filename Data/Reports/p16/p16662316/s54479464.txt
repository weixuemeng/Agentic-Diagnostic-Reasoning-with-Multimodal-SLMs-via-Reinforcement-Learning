 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  COPD, exacerbation, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is focal
 consolidation in the medial segment of the right middle lobe compatible with
 pneumonia.  Also noted is a left lower lobe opacity, likely also representing
 pneumonia.  Tiny left and right pleural effusions are seen.  Upper lobe
 lucency is compatible with known emphysema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe and left lower lobe pneumonia with tiny
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Emphysema again noted.
