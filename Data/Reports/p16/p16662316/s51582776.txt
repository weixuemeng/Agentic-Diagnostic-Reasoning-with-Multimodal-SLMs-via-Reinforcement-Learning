                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are persistently hyperinflated.  There is persistent left
 retrocardiac peribronchial opacity.  Volume loss and consolidation in the
 right middle lobe is persistent.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are
 otherwise normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe partial atelectasis and left retrocardiac
 peribronchial opacity are potentially related to an acute infectious process
 given symptoms of fever and cough.  Follow up radiographs 4 to 6 weeks after
 antibiotics is recommended to ensure resolution. If this fails to resolve, CT
 would be recommended.
