 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to most recent prior radiographs of the chest

 FINDINGS:  Single portable AP view of the chest demonstrates interval increase
 in overall cardiac size, with loss of the normal atrioventricular contours. 
 There is no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal air space
 opacification.  No overt pulmonary edema is noted.  A left scapular orthopedic
 screw is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
