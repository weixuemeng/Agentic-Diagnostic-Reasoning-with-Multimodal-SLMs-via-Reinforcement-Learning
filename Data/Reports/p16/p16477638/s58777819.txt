 INDICATION:  Malaise.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is top normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Focal opacity is noted within the right lung
 base, which likely represents a summation of shadows, and no correlate can be
 seen on the lateral view.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence for pneumonia.  Focal opacity within the
 right lung base likely represents a summation of shadows.
