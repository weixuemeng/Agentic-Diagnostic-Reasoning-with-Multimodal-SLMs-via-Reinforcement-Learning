 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Status post coronary artery bypass surgery.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is
 persistent opacification of the left lung base with a pleural effusion, but
 probably decreased somewhat.  What is new, however, is an opacity in the right
 lower lung, probably in the right lower lobe, noting that it does not
 silhouette either the right cardiac border or hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving opacity at the left lung base, probably reflecting for
 the most part decreasing pleural effusion.  New right basilar opacity, in the
 appropriate clinical setting compatible with pneumonia.
