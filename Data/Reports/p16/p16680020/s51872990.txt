                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Three days after CABG.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable with expected location 
 of the sternal wires, as well as the post-CABG surgical clips.  Left pleural
 effusion is moderate.  There is minimal amount of pneumomediastinum.  There is
 no definitive pneumothorax seen.  Note is made of the suspected fracture of
 the posterior aspect of the right fifth rib, if clinically warranted,
 correlation with dedicated rib views might be considered.  Minimal amount of
 right pleural effusion is present.  There is no pulmonary edema.
