                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:07 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with increasing oxygen requirement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Opacification is worsening in both lungs, suggesting it is edema, though there
 is some asymmetry with more consolidation in the lateral aspect of the right
 mid lung.  Pulmonary edema should be considered as first option.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and severe mediastinal vascular engorgement are
 unchanged.  Right basal pleural drainage tube still in place.  No appreciable
 right pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Left subclavian line ends at the origin of the SVC; ET tube tip is at the
 thoracic inlet, no less than 6 cm from the carina, 2 cm above optimal
 placement.  Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
