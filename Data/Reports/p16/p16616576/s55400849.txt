 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with right shoulder pain status post fall.
 +headstrike
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacer device is again noted with leads terminating in the regions
 of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Lung volumes are persistently low. 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is likely due to low lung
 volumes.  No overt pulmonary edema is present.  Patchy atelectasis is seen in
 the lung bases without focal consolidation.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  The osseous structures are diffusely
 demineralized with multilevel moderate degenerative changes and
 dextroscoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
