                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, status post intubation, here to evaluate
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available at this time due to the patient's
 critical status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating below the
 thoracic inlet, approximately 3 cm above the carina.  A right PICC is in
 place, with the tip overlying terminating in the low SVC.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for size.  Partial
 calcification at the aortic knob is noted.  The hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  The lungs are hyperinflated with lucency at the bilateral lung
 apices compatible with emphysema.  Streaky bibasilar opacities may represent
 infection or aspiration.  There is blunting at the left costophrenic angle
 compatible with a small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube tip 3 cm above the carina.
 2.  Small left pleural effusion and bibasilar opacities on the left greater
 than the right, which may reflect infection or aspiration. 
 3.  Emphysema.
