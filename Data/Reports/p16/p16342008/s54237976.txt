                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of
 sarcoidosis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged, predominantly left ventricle and to lesser
 extent right ventricle, unchanged.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  The hila
 appears to be stable or decreased in size as compared to the prior study,
 which might be consistent with decrease in lymphadenopathy but no worsening
 demonstrated since the prior examination.  Lungs are essentially clear with no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Hyperinflation is suspected.
