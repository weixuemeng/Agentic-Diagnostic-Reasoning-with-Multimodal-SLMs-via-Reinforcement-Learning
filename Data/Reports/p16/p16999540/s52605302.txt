                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of asthma and worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate hyperexpansion
 but no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Additionally,
 there is probably a component of emphysema in the lower lobes.  The hila are
 elevated, suggesting scarring.  Pleuroparenchymal scarring is noted in the
 apices.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperexpansion.  No consolidation.
