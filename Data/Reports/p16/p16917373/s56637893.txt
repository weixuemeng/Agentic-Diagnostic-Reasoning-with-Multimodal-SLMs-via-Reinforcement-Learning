                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypertension and weakness, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Increased opacity overlies the
 lower thoracic spine on the lateral view and is difficult to localize on the
 PA view.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Multiple prior healed right rib
 fractures are unchanged.  Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch
 are again noted.  Degenerative changes are seen at the right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Subtle increased opacity overlying the lower thoracic spine on the lateral
 view may be projectional.  A repeat lateral radiograph may be helpful to
 exclude a basilar pneumonia.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion
