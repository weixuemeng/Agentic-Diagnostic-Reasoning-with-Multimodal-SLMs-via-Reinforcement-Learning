                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with stroke and an x-ray to rule out pneumonia  //
 Pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors including ___, ___ ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left base opacity is seen with obscuration of left hemidiaphragm, slightly
 increased as compared to the prior study.  Differential diagnosis includes
 atelectasis, aspiration, and pneumonia.  Mild right base opacity also seen
 which could relate to the above as well.  No large pleural effusion is seen. 
 There is mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight increase in bibasilar opacities could be due to aspiration or pneumonia
 or even atelectasis.  Mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Increase in interstitial opacities bilaterally most likely due to vascular
 congestion, but atypical infection not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
