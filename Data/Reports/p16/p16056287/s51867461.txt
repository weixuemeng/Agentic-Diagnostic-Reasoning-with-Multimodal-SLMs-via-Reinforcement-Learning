                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.8 cm from the carina. Enteric
 tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm and into the stomach, with tip
 off the inferior borders of the film. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is demonstrated. Mediastinal contour is prominent superiorly,
 likely due to supine positioning and low lung volumes.  Bilateral perihilar
 opacities, more pronounced on the right, suggests moderate pulmonary edema. 
 More focal opacity in the right upper lobe could reflect infection or
 aspiration. Layering right pleural effusion is also noted and there is likely
 a small left pleural effusion.No displaced fractures are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Moderate pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions.
 3. More focal opacity in the right upper lobe possibly due to infection or
 aspiration.
