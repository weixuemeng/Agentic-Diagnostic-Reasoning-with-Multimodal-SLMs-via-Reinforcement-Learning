                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lung Ca c/b PNA and hemoptysis, intubated 
 // Interval change? Pulm edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and left-sided PICC line are unchanged in
 position.  Study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation.  However
 allowing for this, there has been no interval change. There is again seen
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and bilateral pleural effusions.  There
 remains prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of mild
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothoraces are identified.
