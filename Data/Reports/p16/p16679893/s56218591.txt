                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SCLCa  // PNA, PTX, Bleed?      PNA, PTX,
 Bleed?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 opacification on the right, consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss
 in the right middle lobe and apparent collapse of the right lower lobe.  On
 the left, there is increased opacification in the mid to lower zone.  This is
 worrisome for developing pneumonia.  Due to the overlying opacifications, it
 is difficult to assess the degree of pulmonary edema.
 Left subclavian catheter tip remains in the mid SVC.
