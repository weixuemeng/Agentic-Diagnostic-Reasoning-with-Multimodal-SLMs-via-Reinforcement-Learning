                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia or bleeding in a patient status post
 bronchoscopy and arterial embolization.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an endotracheal tube
 terminating in the mid thoracic trachea, left PICC terminating in the mid SVC,
 and enteric tube terminating within the stomach.  Cardiac size remains normal.
 A right pleural effusion is likely unchanged, allowing for differences in
 patient position.  The right lower lobe remains collapsed, but the right upper
 lobe is clear.  Heterogeneous consolidation of the left lower lobe is worse
 compared to ___.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Heterogeneous consolidation of the left lower lobe is worse compared to ___, unclear if this is pneumonia or atelectasis.  Continued monitoring
 which chest radiograph is recommended.
 2. Likely unchanged right lower lobe collapse and right pleural effusion,
 allowing for differences in patient positioning.
 3. Improved mild pulmonary edema.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   These findings were communicated via telephone by Dr.
 ___ to Dr. ___ at 11:58 on ___.
