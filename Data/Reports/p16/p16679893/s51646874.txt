                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o F hx of ulcerative colitis on azathioprine and mesalamine,
 hx of BRCA+ with extensive family hx of malignancy and s/p bilateral
 prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy, transferred to the FICU for
 management of metastatic small cell lung cancer and hypoxic respiratory
 failure with clot in Right main bronchus causing lung collapse  // Assess Lung
 (especially r lung collapse) post IP procedure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided PICC terminates in the proximal SVC.  An endotracheal tube
 terminates 3.9 cm above the carina.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.  There is improved aeration in the upper and mid right lung status
 post recent bronchoscopy.  There is persistent opacity at the base of the
 right lung and involving the mid right lung consistent with effusion and
 collapse.  The left lung shows subtle opacities at the base, suggesting
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved aeration of the upper and mid right lung status post bronchoscopy. 
 Persistent opacity at the base of the right lung likely represents a moderate
 pleural effusion and right middle lobe and right lower lobe collapse.
