                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Calcified pleural plaques are again widespread along the left hemithorax, most
 often seen in the setting of prior asbestos exposure, although reaction to a
 pleural effusion of other cause might be considered, noting that these are
 apparently unilateral.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 lung parenchyma appears clear.  There is again moderate rightward convex
 curvature centered at thoracolumbar junction with multilevel degenerative
 changes.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
