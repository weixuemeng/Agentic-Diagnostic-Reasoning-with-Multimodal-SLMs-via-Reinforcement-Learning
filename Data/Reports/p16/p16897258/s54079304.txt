                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Left VATS and pleurodesis with placement of Pleurx catheter. 
 Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Large left pleural effusion, with multiple loculations, has increased since
 ___ and left pleural drainage tube is still in place. 
 Pneumoperitoneum reflects recent abdominal surgery.  Cardiac silhouette is
 partially obscured but probably not enlarged.  Right lung is clear of edema,
 but there is new opacification in the right infrahilar region, raising concern
 for pneumonia or more likely atelectasis and multiple pulmonary nodules are
 visible in a perihilar distribution.
