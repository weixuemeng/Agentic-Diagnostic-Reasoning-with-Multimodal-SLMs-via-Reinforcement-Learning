                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: Metastatic renal cancer. Assess for interval change.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left pleural drain is seen projected over the left hemithorax, unchanged.  
 
 There is large left pleural effusion, minimally decreased from the prior
 study. Left lower lobe atelecatasis has improved.  Again, lucency below the
 right hemidiaphragm is consistent with recent abdominal surgery. Opacity at
 the right base represents multiple lung nodules on right and right
 lymphadenopathy. Known mediastinal lymphadenopathy better seen on recent CT. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large left pleural effusion with multiple loculations is minimally decreased
 in size from the prior study.
