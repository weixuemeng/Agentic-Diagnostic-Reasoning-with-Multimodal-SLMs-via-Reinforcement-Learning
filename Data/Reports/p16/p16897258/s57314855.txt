                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 One of two left-sided chest tubes has been removed.  There is a persistent
 moderate-to-large partially loculated left pleural effusion with loculated
 hydropneumothorax components laterally and basally.  As compared to the recent
 study, there has been some improved aeration at the left lung base with
 residual atelectasis involving portions of the lingula and left lower lobe. 
 Within the right lung, clustered poorly defined nodular opacities are again
 demonstrated in the right mid lung region and have been more fully
 characterized on recent CT in addition to nodules in the left hemithorax which
 are largely obscured on today's radiograph by the above-described effusion and
 atelectasis.  Subcutaneous emphysema is again demonstrated in the left chest
 wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post removal of one of two left chest tubes with loculated
 left pleural effusion and loculated hydropneumothoraces as described. 
 Clustered right mid lung nodules and scattered diffuse nodular opacities have
 been more fully characterized on recent outside CT of ___.
