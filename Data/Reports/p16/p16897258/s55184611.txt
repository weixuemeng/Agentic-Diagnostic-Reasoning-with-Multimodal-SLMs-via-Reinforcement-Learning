                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after left VATS and
 pleurodesis.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 After left pleurodesis, there is a decrease in the left pleural effusion,
 currently with loculated left basal pneumothorax and potentially trapped lung.
 Subcutaneous air is noted, not substantial.  Left chest tube is in place.  No
 apical component of pneumothorax is seen , thus the basal pneumothorax is
 loculated.
