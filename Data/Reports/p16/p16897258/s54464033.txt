                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post pleurodesis and left VATS.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent, moderate to large partially loculated left pleural effusion with
 components of loculated lateral and basilar hydropneumothorax.  A left chest
 tube is again noted to be in place.  As compared to the most recent
 examination, there has been a slight improvement in the aeration of both the
 right and left lungs.  Residual atelectasis is seen within the lingula and
 left lower lobe.  The right lung is essentially clear, other than the multiple
 tiny nodules which are better characterized on the recent chest CT, and which
 are somewhat less prominent today as compared to the prior chest radiographs. 
 The patient previously extensive subcutaneous emphysema has now almost
 entirely resolved.
