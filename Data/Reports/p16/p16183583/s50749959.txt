                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman intubated  // Please confirm OGT placement and
 ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 6.4 cm above the carina.  A left-sided PICC is in
 stable position. Enteric tube descends below the field of view.
 
 Lung volumes are low, as before. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.  Bibasilar opacities are again demonstrated, not increased from the
 prior exam and are suggestive of atelectasis.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 6.4 cm above the carina. Persistent bibasilar
 opacities suggest atelectasis however could represent infection in appropriate
 setting.
