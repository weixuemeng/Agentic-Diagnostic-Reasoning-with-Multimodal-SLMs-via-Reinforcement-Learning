                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F p/w respiratory failure, found to have diffuse nodular
 densities, s/p L lung VATS biopsy  // Interval assesment     ; ___ year old
 woman with hypoxemic respiratory failure, s/p VATS ___ with L chest tube  //
 eval post op change following VATS wedge resection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The radiograph time stamped ___46 shows a low-lying endotracheal tube which
 enters the right mainstem bronchus.  The left PICC line terminates in the
 right atrium. Withdrawal by 3 cm would position its tip near the cavoatrial
 junction.  A left apical chest tube remains in place. Lung volumes are low.
 There is no pneumothorax. Worsening bilateral airspace and interstitial
 opacities are most likely due to worsening pulmonary edema. There is no
 pleural effusion.  Mild cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged.
 
 The followup radiograph time stamped 22:49 shows interval repositioning of the
 ET tube, which now terminates in the mid trachea. There is also a new tiny
 left apical pneumothorax with a left apical chest tube in place. The left PICC
 line has been slightly withdrawn, but still enters the upper right atrium.
 Withdrawal by 2 cm would position its tip at the cavoatrial junction. No other
 relevant change.
 
 The most recent radiograph of 03:57 hrs shows a slight change in the position
 of the left PICC line, which just barely enters the right atrium. Withdrawal
 by 1-2 cm with position its tip in the low SVC. There is no definite
 pneumothorax. Bandlike opacities at both lung bases are likely due to
 atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema has slightly improved. A persistent
 retrocardiac airspace opacity may be due to atelectasis or aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously low lying ET tube entering the right mainstem bronchus now
 terminates in the mid trachea.
 
 Slightly low lying left PICC line terminates in the upper right atrium.
 Withdrawal by 1-2 cm would position its tip at the superior cavoatrial
 junction.
 
 Tiny left apical pneumothorax not seen on the most recent exam.
 
 Improved mild pulmonary edema, right basilar subsegmental atelectasis, and a
 left basilar airspace opacity which may be due to atelectasis or aspiration.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The covering clinician could not be immediately reached by
 telephone, therefore the impression and recommendation above was entered by
 Dr. ___ on ___ at 10:06 into the Department of Radiology critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
