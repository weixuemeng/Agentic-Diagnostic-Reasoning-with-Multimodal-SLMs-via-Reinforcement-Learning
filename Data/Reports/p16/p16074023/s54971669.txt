                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Smoker, stroke.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiograph ___ at 8:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is diffusely calcified and
 tortuous.  The mediastinal contour is otherwise unremarkable.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  The lungs are clear.  Hyperinflation of the lungs with
 relative attenuation of vascular markings towards the lung apices may suggest
 underlying emphysema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized. 
 There are cholecystectomy clips noted in the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
