                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma, evaluation pre-bone marrow transplant.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  Two
 subcentimeter elliptical nodular opacities overlying the posterolateral aspect
 of the left fourth rib are most likely rib based.  Lungs are otherwise clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A mild anterior wedge
 compression of one of the lower thoracic vertebral bodies is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Two subcentimeter elliptical nodular opacities overlying the
 posterolateral aspect of the left fourth rib are likely rib based, but can be
 further evaluated by CT if there is clinical suspicion for metastatic disease.
 2.  Mild anterior wedge compression of a lower thoracic vertebral body of
 unclear chronicity without comparison.
