 pulmonary edema and LUL plug
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___, multifocal airspace consolidation in the
 right lung shows interval improvement in the mid and lower lungs.  New
 consolidation has developed in the left juxta hilar region.  Findings are
 concerning for multifocal pneumonia with or without coexisting secondary
 process such as edema or aspiration.  Positional differences limit comparison,
 but right pleural effusion has apparently decreased in size whereas a left
 pleural effusion has apparently increased.  No other relevant change.
