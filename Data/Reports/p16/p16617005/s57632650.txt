                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with IPH and ETOH use, s/p afib with RVR and VT
 s/p cardioversion  // s/p unstable SVT and VT s/p cardioversion. hypoxia
 stable on face mask
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ from earlier in the day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph there are new near confluent opacities throughout
 the right lung.  The left lung appears relatively clear.  The small left
 pleural effusion is present.  No pneumothorax identified.
 
 The size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 The tip of the left central venous catheter projects over the mid SVC.  The
 endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea and a feeding tube
 extends beyond the field of view of this radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in the patchy and confluent airspace opacities throughout
 the right lung with a suspected underlying layering pleural effusion may
 reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema versus underlying infection.  Interval
 decrease in the left lung zone opacities with a small remaining pleural
 effusion.
