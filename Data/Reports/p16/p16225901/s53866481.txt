                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Seizure, syncope, and fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There is vague opacity in the lingula and possibly the right
 lower lobe but these areas are suspected to represent minor atelectatic change
 or scarring.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflation.  No definite evidence of acute disease.  Streaky opacities
 suggesting minor scarring.
