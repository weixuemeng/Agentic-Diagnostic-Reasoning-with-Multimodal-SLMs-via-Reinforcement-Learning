                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hemoptysis and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___ and reference CT dated ___ from___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates marked opacification
 of the left middle and lower lung with significant volume loss as evidenced by
 marked leftward cardiomediastinal shift.  As correlated to the preceding
 reference CT from___ of the same day, there is significant
 endobronchial material obstructing the left main bronchus.  There is likely a
 combination of consolidation, bronchial wall thickening, and pleural effusion
 in the left lung as well as volume loss, producing the overall opacification. 
 The right lung remains relatively well aerated.  There is evidence of
 underlying emphysema, without radiographic evidence of pneumothorax.  Findings
 consistent with left main bronchial obstruction with left middle and lower
 lobe collapse, in addition to consolidation, bronchial wall thickening, and
 large left pleural effusion.  Overall constellations are highly concerning for
 malignancy, although supervening infection and/or aspiration may be present.
