 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and auditory hallucinations.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dual lead pacemaker/ICD device whose leads terminate in
 the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The heart is mildly enlarged. 
 There is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Slight fullness of each hilum suggests minimal vascular
 congestion.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of slight vascular congestion or fluid
 overload; otherwise unremarkable.
