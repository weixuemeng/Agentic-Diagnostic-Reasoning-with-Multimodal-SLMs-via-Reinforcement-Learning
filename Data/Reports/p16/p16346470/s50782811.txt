                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is suggestion of a large hiatal hernia and likely
 diaphragmatic eventration or Morgagni hernia, evidenced by bowel projecting
 over the low anterior chest on lateral view; this limits evaluation at the
 lung bases.  Within this limitation, no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema is detected. Mild interstitial change in the left upper lung
 and minimal opacification of the posterior lung base on lateral view are
 non-specific; chronicity cannot be determined in the absence of prior imaging.
 Heart size is difficult to evaluate in this setting.  The aorta is tortuous
 and calcified.  Prominence of the ascending aorta may be due to patient
 position, but ascending aortic aneurysm cannot be excluded.
 
 Loss of vertebral body height in the thoracic spine with thoracic kyphosis is
 age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Limited exam due to at least one large hernia vs eventration of the
 diaphragm without definitive radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary
 process.  
 2.  Possible ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm.
 3.  Thoracic kyphosis with vertebral body loss of height at multiple levels,
 age indeterminate.
 
 Due to indeterminate findings and limitations, CT may be helpful if clinically
 warranted. 
 
 Findings discussed with ___ by ___ by telephone at 3:40
 p.m. on ___ at the time of initial review of the study.
