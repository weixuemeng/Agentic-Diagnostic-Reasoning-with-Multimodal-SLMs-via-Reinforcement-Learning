                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___, ___, CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably with the patient
 in the upright position.  The study is limited due to patient's body habitus. 
 Low lung volumes results in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal
 consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Small pleural
 effusions would be difficult to exclude.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unchanged.  Hilar contours are normal allowing for lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: Limited study. No definite pneumonia or edema.
