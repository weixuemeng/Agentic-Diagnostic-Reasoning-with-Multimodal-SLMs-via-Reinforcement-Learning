                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.  Low
 lung volumes likely accentuate the bronchovascular markings, although minimal
 interstitial edema may still be present.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly and possible minimal interstitial edema.  Low
 lung volumes, which likely accentuate the bronchovascular markings.
