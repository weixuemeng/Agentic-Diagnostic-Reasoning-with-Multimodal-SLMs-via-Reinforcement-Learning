                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with asthma, right lower lobe
 pneumonia diagnosed on ___ on CT.  Evaluate for progression.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  Moderate enlargement of
 cardiac contours similar as before.  Noted is a regression of the previously
 existing distention of the azygos vein contour.  The pulmonary vasculature
 which was congested with distended appearance of the pulmonary vasculature and
 considerable perivascular haze has now normalized.  No evidence of acute
 pulmonary infiltrates remain and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are
 free.  No pneumothorax exists in the apical area.  Skeletal structures of the
 thorax remain unremarkable as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Regression of pulmonary congestion with signs of pre-edema in the
 right lung base.  Presently no remaining congestive pattern and the pleural
 spaces are free.  The chest CT of ___ obtained one day after the
 preceding PA and lateral chest examination is also reviewed.  There existed
 increased density of the vasculature in the right lower lobe area on the CT
 examination with the patient in supine position.  These densities were
 identified as possibly representing local edema, atelectasis or inflammatory
 infiltrate. As from the plain pa & lat chest appearance and its present
 resolution, it is more likely that it consisted of local edema in this patient
 with evidence of CHF at that time.
