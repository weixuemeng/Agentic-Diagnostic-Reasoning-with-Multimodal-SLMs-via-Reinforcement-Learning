 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status, falls
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided AICD device is noted with leads terminating in the regions of the
 right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus.  Heart size remains
 moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. No focal consolidation is present, and
 a retrocardiac patchy opacity likely reflects atelectasis. No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is visualized. There are mild degenerative changes noted in
 the thoracic spine.  On the lateral view, 5 rounded densities measuring up to
 16 mm are noted within the anterior upper abdomen, likely external to the
 patient given their relatively uniform appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Mild
 retrocardiac atelectasis. 5 rounded densities projecting over the upper
 abdomen on the lateral view only, likely external to the patient given their
 uniform appearance.
