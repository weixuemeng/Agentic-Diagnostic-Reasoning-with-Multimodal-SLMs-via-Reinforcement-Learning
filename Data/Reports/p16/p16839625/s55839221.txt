                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, asthma exacerbation.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Lung volumes are low.  There is a
 retrocardiac posterior lower lobe opacity more readily appreciated on the
 lateral view.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal.  There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature due to
 incomplete inspiration.
