                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A poorly defined opacity has developed in the right infrahilar
 region, with an adjacent linear opacity.  Additional patchy opacity is new in
 the left retrocardiac area.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.  Small pleural effusions are new compared to the prior radiograph. 
 Prominence of the splenic contour is noted in the imaged portion of the upper
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New patchy and linear lower lung opacities, likely due to atelectasis or
 acute aspiration given rapid development.  
 
 2.  Prominent splenic contour.
