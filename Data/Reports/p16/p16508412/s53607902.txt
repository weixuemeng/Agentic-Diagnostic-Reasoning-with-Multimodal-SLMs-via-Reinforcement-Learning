                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status epilepticus, assess for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ (MRN:___).
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable radiograph of the chest was acquired.  The
 patient is rotated to the left.  An endotracheal tube ends 2.7 cm above the
 level of the carina.  An enteric catheter courses below the level of the
 diaphragm, ending within the stomach.  Lung volumes are slightly low.
 Heterogeneous left mid lung opacities could be due to atelectasis, aspiration
 pneumonitis, or infection.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Note is made of
 cardiac dextroposition.  The heart is normal in size. There is no
 pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Heterogeneous left mid lung opacities, possibly atelectasis, aspiration
 pneumonitis or infection.  Follow-up PA and lateral radiographs are
 recommended when the patient is clinically stable.
 
 2.  Appropriately positioned endotracheal and enteric catheters.
 
 Findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at
 7:40 a.m. via telephone on the day of the study.
