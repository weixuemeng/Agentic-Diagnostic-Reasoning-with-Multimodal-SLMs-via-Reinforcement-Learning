                                 FINAL REPORT
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to prior study from four hours ago.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate a persistent small
 right apical pneumothorax, no larger in size compared to the prior study.  A
 layering right pleural effusion has increased.  There is also atelectasis of
 the right lung base, similar in appearance compared to the prior study.  The
 left lung is grossly clear.  No pleural effusion or left-sided pneumothorax is
 identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal in appearance.  Right
 rib fractures are again noted.  Right lateral chest wall subcutaneous
 emphysema extending into the soft tissues of the right lateral neck is similar
 in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent small right apical pneumothorax, no larger since the
 prior study, although the right pleural effusion has progressed.  Repeat
 radiographs are recommended to evaluate for stability.  Right-sided rib
 fractures are unchanged.
