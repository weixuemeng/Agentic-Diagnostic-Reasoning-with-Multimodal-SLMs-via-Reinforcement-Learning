                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with COPD, CKD, CHF presents with increased lower
 extremity edema and dysphagia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is diffusely calcified
 and tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, findings suggestive of COPD.
 No pulmonary edema is present. Scarring is noted within the lung apices, as
 well as a linear opacity within the left mid lung field which may reflect an
 additional site of scarring or subsegmental atelectasis. Streaky opacities in
 the lung bases may reflect atelectasis, but no focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is present. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles could
 suggest pleural thickening or trace pleural fluid.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is demonstrated.  The distal right clavicle may have been
 surgically resected with elevation of the right distal clavicle relative to
 the acromion, findings suggestive of chronic injury.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis and or scarring. Possible trace bilateral pleural
 effusions versus pleural thickening.
