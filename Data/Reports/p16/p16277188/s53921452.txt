                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increased retrocardiac opacity; however, this may be
 technical or external in nature given the configuration and its inferior
 extension to a level below the expected lower margin of the lung into the
 upper abdomen.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged, but stable in configuration given differences in technique. 
 Hypertrophic changes are noted in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity which is likely artifactual/technical. 
 Consider PA and lateral to further characterize.  Otherwise unremarkable.
