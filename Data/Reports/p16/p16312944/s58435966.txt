                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of patient with congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 Widespread parenchymal opacities are unchanged with minimal if at all
 fluctuation between the radiographs.  Despite the presumed diagnosis of
 pulmonary edema, underlying infectious process, widespread or ARDS cannot be
 excluded and should be evaluated from the clinical standpoint.  No appreciable
 pleural effusion is seen which also contradicts the presumed diagnosis of
 pulmonary edema.
