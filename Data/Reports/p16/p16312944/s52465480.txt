                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of COPD exacerbation,
 hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Diffuse
 alveolar opacities throughout the lungs, right greater than left, which could
 represent asymmetric edema and/or infection.  Slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle may be due to trace pleural effusion.  The patient is
 status post median sternotomy.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The
 aorta is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse bilateral, right much greater than left alveolar
 opacities could relate to asymmetric edema and/or infection.  Correlate
 clinically and consider repeat after diuresis.  Comparison with prior
 radiographs would be helpful.
