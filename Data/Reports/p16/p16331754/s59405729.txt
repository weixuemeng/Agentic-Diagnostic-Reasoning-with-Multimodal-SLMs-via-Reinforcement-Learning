 Comparison to ___.  The patient has been Re intubated.  The tip of
 the endotracheal tube projects 6 cm above the carinal.  The right central
 venous access line is in stable position.  The line should be pulled back by
 approximately 3 cm to be positioned at the cavoatrial junction.  No
 complications, notably no pneumothorax.  Volume loss in the right lower lung,
 associated with elevation of the hemidiaphragm and an opacity with air
 bronchograms.  The findings are highly suggestive of an aspiration event. 
 Minimal similar changes are seen on the left.
