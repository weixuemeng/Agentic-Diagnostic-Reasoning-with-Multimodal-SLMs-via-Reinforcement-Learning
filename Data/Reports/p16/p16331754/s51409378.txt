                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p ureteral stent with new O2 requirement to
 8L  // question aspiration vs. pleural effusion vs. volume overload     
 question aspiration vs. pleural effusion vs. volume overload
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is increased opacification
 bilaterally, more prominent on the right.  This could well represent
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.  However, the possibility of aspiration could
 certainly not be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 The costophrenic angles are sharply seen and there is no evidence of pleural
 effusion.  The right IJ catheter again extends to the right atrium.
