                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Diffuse edema; question congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are substantial bilateral pleural effusions, at least
 moderate in size with associated parenchymal opacification, probably
 compatible with associated atelectasis in the lower lobes.  Slight fullness of
 each hilum and indistinct contours suggest very mild congestion, but without
 frank congestive heart failure.  There is no pneumothorax.  Bony structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Substantial pleural effusions with associated opacities, probably
 compatible with associated atelectasis.  Findings suggestive of slight
 perihilar congestion.
