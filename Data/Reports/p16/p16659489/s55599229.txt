 ___ AND PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without
 change.  Lungs are clear except for minimal linear scar versus atelectasis
 within the lingula.  There are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal
 findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No conventional radiographic evidence of amiodarone lung
 toxicity.  If clinical suspicion is high, high-resolution chest CT may be
 considered if warranted clinically.
