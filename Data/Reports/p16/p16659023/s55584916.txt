                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with orbital cellulitis and lung nodule.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___.
 
 Blunting of the lateral right pleural sulcus is new and could indicate a tiny
 pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal, partially obscured by mediastinal
 fat.  Other mediastinal contours, hila and left pleural surfaces are normal. 
 Lateral view suggests a ___ x 18 mm lung nodule projecting over the
 retrosternal region and the pulmonary outflow tract.  There was a similar
 opacity on ___, and this may well just be mediastinal fat
 deposition.  Nevertheless, conventional oblique chest radiographs would be
 helpful to exclude a subtle lung nodule.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged.
