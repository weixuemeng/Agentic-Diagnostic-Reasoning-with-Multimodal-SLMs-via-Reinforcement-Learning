  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.2 cm above the carina.  Very edge
  of the right costophrenic angle is not captured on the current study.  Streaky
  bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis.  Remainder of the lungs are
  otherwise clear.  No pleural effusion on the left.  No pneumothorax. 
  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
