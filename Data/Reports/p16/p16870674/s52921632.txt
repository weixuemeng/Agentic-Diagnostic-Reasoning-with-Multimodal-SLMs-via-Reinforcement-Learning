                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with colon cancer and renal cell carcinoma, now
 requiring followup imaging after a portable film demonstrated possible lung
 nodule earlier today, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 CT abdomen and pelvis from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate a semicircular
 opacity about 10 mm in diameter superiorly adjacent to the minor fissure. 
 This could represent a nodule versus consolidation versus aspiration. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  The lungs are clear.  There is
 no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Left subclavian Port-A-Cath is again
 seen ending in the SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ___-mm opacity again seen in the right middle lung just superior
 to the minor fissure, likely representing a nodule versus consolidation versus
 aspiration.  Comparison with previous imaging from outside facilities would
 facilitate identification of the mass.
