                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with two months of cough, assess for
 interstitial infiltrate or nodule.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable single view
 chest examination of ___.  Comparison is also extended to a PA and
 lateral chest examination of ___.
 
 In the present examination both diaphragms rather high positioned indicative
 of poor inspirational effort resulting in some crowded appearance of the
 pulmonary vasculature on the bases.  Acute parenchymal infiltrates, however,
 cannot be identified and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free
 from any fluid accumulation.  No acute pulmonary infiltrates are identified
 anywhere and there is no pneumothorax in the apical area.  Skeletal structures
 of the thorax is grossly unremarkable.  In the next preceding portable chest
 examination, the patient had a right-sided diaphragmatic elevation, the course
 of which was unknown.  No acute pulmonary abnormalities are present.  On the
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___, the chest findings were
 considered to be normal.  The relatively high positioned diaphragms could be
 explained by patient's personal constitution.  Comparison with today's PA and
 lateral chest examination indicates several gain in body weight.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No cardiac enlargement, pulmonary congestion, or acute pulmonary
 infiltrates.
