                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female who is ___ weeks pregnant with asthma flare and
 ongoing hemoptysis.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, dated ___
 through ___, and CT of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  There has been slight interval
 improvement in the bilateral areas of parenchymal opacity, suggesting
 improving atelectasis and decreasing pulmonary edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 is stable.  There is no pneumothorax, consolidation, or pleural effusion. The
 left sided pectoral pacemaker is seen with leads in unchanged position.
 However, as seen on the CT of the chest dated ___, the right
 atrial lead actually ends in the right atrial appendage.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval improvement in bilateral parenchymal opacities,
 suggesting improving atelectasis and pulmonary edema.
