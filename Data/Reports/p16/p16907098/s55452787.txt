                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 8:40 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with question of hemoptysis and respiratory
 distress on a vent, evaluate for support structures.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 4:53.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A pacer remains in place.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at
 thoracic inlet.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with
 the tip not identified.  Heart remains stably enlarged.  Mediastinal contours
 are unchanged.  Hilar contours are prominent and when correlated with the
 recent CT likely reflects a combination of hilar lymphadenopathy and pulmonary
 artery hypertension.  Improved aeration at the left base suggesting resolving
 atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax, although
 sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given semi-erect technique.
