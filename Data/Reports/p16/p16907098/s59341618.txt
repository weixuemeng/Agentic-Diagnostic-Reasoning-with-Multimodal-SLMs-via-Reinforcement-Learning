 HISTORY:  Pregnant with recurrent hemoptysis and asthma history.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal,
 nasogastric, and central catheter tubes have been removed with the pacer
 device remaining in place.  Low lung volumes accentuate the transverse
 diameter of the heart.  Mild fullness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with
 some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
