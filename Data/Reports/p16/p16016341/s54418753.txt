                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shoulder pain and diaphoresis, assess for acute process in
 the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs appear
 clear bilaterally without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  On
 the lateral view there is a nodular opacity projecting over the mid thoracic
 spine which given lack of correlate view on the frontal projection may
 represent an external artifact.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No osseous abnormalities are
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
