                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increased cough and sputum production.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A moderate right
 pleural effusion tracks into the minor and majors fissures.  Right lower lung
 opacification may be atelectasis and pleural effusion, however, consolidation
 cannot be excluded.  Mild pulmonary edema is present.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is not well evaluated due to the right lower lung opacity, however,
 it is grossly unchanged compared to the prior study.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right sided pleural effusion and lower lung atelectasis, cannot
 exclude underlying consolidation.  Mild pulmonary edema.
