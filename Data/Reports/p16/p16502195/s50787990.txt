                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with respiratory distress on face mask, possible cancer,
 pneumonia, rule out interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema is new.  Right lower lung opacities, atelectasis and
 pleural effusion are unchanged.  Cardiac contour is top normal.  Mediastinal
 contour is hard to assess due to rotation of the patient.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema is new.
 
 2.  Right lower lung consolidation with pleural effusion is unchanged, which
 could reflect atelectasis, pneumonia or aspiration.
