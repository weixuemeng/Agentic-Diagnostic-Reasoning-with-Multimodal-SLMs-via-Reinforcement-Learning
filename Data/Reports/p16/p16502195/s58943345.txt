                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with small bowel obstruction, transition point, look for
 pleural effusion, fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient has been extubated since prior exam and the lung volumes are
 lower.  NG tube is unchanged.   Bibasilar consolidation is more prominent on
 the right side and could be related to atelectasis, but superimposed infection
 or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Right pleural effusion is small.  Volume
 overload is unchanged and mild.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and
 cardiac contours are normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.
 2.  Stable right small pleural effusion.
 3.  Stable bibasilar consolidation, more prominent on the right side could be
 due only to atelectasis; however, superimposed infection or aspiration cannot
 be excluded.
