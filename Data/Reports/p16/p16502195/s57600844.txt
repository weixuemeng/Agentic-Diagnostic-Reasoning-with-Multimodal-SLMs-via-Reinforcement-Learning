 FINDINGS:  Compared with prior radiograph, the right effusions have increased.
 The left effusion is somewhat smaller with better aeration of the left lower

 asymmetric pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is present.  There is residual
 opacification at the left lower lung.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing right pleural effusion and asymmetric pulmonary edema
 in the right lung with some improvement in left pleural effusion and left
 lower lobe aeration.
