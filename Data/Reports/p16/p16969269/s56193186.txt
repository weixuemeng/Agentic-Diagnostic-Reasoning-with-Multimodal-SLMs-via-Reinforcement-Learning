                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia, s/p 3L resuscitation, evaluate for pulmonary
 edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right mid and lower lung airspace opacification is similar to the prior study
 and consistent with a right lower lobe pneumonia, as previously described. 
 There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured an otherwise normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged right lower lobe pneumonia.
 2. No pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Follow-up chest radiographs in no more than 6 weeks are
 extremely important in order to document substantial clearing of right lower
 lobe pneumonia to exclude other pathology.
