                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Decrease in breath sounds on right.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier.
 
 A moderate right pneumothorax is unchanged.  In the subsequent chest x-ray, a
 right chest tube has been placed.  ET tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, mediastinal
 left chest tube and NG tube are in unchanged, standard position.  Right mid
 lung atelectasis has increased.  Mild-to-moderate vascular congestion has
 increased.  Increased diffuse opacity in the left lung is consistent with the
 pleural effusion.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is grossly unchanged.
