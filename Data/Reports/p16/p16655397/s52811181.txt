 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:21 PM
  In comparison with the prior study, there has been interval placement of the
  right chest tube with likely post procedure emphysematous changes in the soft
  tissues of the right hemithorax. Previously noted sulcal sign concerning for
  pneumothorax is no longer  seen.  Pt is status post CABG   procedure performed
  with intact midline sternal wires.  The endotracheal tube
  iis approximately 4.3 cm above the above the carina.    NGT, right IJ ___-
  Ganz catheter tip and left chest tube are in place. Continued hyperexpansion
  of the lungs with patchy areas of  opacification in the right mid and lower
  left zone are noted.  Atlectasis vs aspiration/ infection in the correct
  clinical setting. ___

 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status CABG, assess after CT placement.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed one hour earlier.
 
 There is a new right mid chest tube.  Right pneumothorax has markedly
 decreased, now is very small.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 There is a new right small pleural effusion.  Right mid lung atelectases are
 unchanged.  Left pleural effusion is unchanged associated with left lower lobe
