                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post CABG and AVR with drop in hematocrit.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  The left lower lobe opacity, a
 combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion is also stable.  There is no
 evident pneumothorax or right pleural effusion.  Lines and tubes remain in
 place in standard, unchanged position.  Of note, the Swan-Ganz catheter tip is
 at the takeoff of the main pulmonary artery.
