                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with two weeks' cough and productive
 yellow sputum.  PE discloses bibasilar focal wheezes and right upper field
 rhonchi and E to A changes.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest
 examination of ___.  Heart size is unchanged and within normal
 limits.  Thoracic aorta mildly elongated but otherwise unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  Comparison is made with the next
 preceding chest examination.  There exist some hazy right-sided basal
 densities in supradiaphragmatic position.  These include a local 1 x 1.5 cm
 density which appears to be a parenchymal infiltrate.  Comparisons made of the
 lateral projections demonstrate a hazy density occupying the area close to the
 lower portion of the right-sided major fissure, thus locating the process to
 either the lower aspect of the right middle lobe or adjacent anterior segment
 of the right lower lobe.  Under any circumstances, a followup after treatment
 in about a week or so is recommended to see normalization of these findings to
 a status as they existed on the preceding chest examination of ___, which was considered to be within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Infiltrate on right lower lung anteriorly, probably pneumonic. 
 Followup recommended.
