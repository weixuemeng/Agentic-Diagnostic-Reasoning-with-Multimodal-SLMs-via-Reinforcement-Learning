 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:17 PM
  Small left apical pneumothorax.  Though subtle changes would be difficult to
  detect given the different modalities, there is no significant change.  A left
  apical opacity is stable, and consistent with a contusion.  The left sided rib
  fractures and scapular fracture are redemonstrated, though better appreciated
  by CT.  Clear right lung.
