                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate adjusted right subclavian and endotracheal tubes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Study performed earlier the same day.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST:
 
 The endotracheal tube has been withdrawn, now terminating approximately 2.5 cm
 from the carina.  Right subclavian line has also been slightly withdrawn, now
 in the region of the upper right atrium/cavoatrial junction.  Nasogastric tube
 again passes into the stomach, but a persistent coil of tubing is seen
 projecting over the neck, suggesting that it is coiled in the hypopharynx. 
 Lung volumes are low.  Basilar atelectasis persists.  No new focal opacity,
 and no effusion or pneumothorax.
