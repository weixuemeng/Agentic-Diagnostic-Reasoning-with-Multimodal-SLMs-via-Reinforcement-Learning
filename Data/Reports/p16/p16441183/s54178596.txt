                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancreatitis and fever with sputum production.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Continued low lung volumes are most likely
 the cause of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  Areas of
 atelectatic change are seen at both bases, though there is no focal pneumonia
 or evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
