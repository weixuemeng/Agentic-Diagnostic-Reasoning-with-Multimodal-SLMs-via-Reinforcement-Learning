                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Severe pancreatitis, to assess for pneumonia and volume status.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Extremely low lung volumes.  There is
 opacification in the retrocardiac region, consistent with some volume loss in
 the left lower lobe.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles suggest small
 pleural effusions.
 
 There is an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 2.8 cm above
 the carina.  Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach.
