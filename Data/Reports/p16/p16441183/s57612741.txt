                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  NG tube positioning, altered mental status.
 
 Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The current study demonstrates the NG tube tip passing below the diaphragm
 with its tip most likely terminating in the distal portion of the stomach, not
 included in the field of view.  The right subclavian line tip is at the level
 of cavoatrial junction. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Lungs
 are essentially clear except for minimal bibasal atelectasis, right more than
 left.
