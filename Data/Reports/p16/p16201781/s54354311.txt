                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Renal status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Patchy opacities, left greater than right raise concern for underlying
 aspiration and/or infection.  Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature
 suggests pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are stable.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
