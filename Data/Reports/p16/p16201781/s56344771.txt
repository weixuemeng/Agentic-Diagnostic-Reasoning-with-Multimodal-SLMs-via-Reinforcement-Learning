                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia, AMS  // evaluate for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion is seen with overlying atelectasis.  There may be
 a trace right pleural effusion.  Right base opacity could be due to
 combination of small pleural effusion and atelectasis, but consolidation due
 to aspiration or pneumonia is not excluded.  Dedicated PA and lateral views
 would be helpful for further evaluation if/when patient able.  There may be an
 additional site of subtle opacity at the right upper lung which could be due
 to a small focus of pneumonia or aspiration.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are stable.  Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is stable in position.
