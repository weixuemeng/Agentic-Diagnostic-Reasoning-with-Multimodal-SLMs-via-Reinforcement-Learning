                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increasing shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable uniform opacification of the complete right hemithorax is
 consistent with a moderate to large pleural effusion.  This is unchanged from
 prior exams.  Moderate pleural effusion on the left, also stable.  The left
 upper lobe is well aerated.  Evaluation for pulmonary edema or consolidations
 is somewhat limited due to the amount of pleural fluid, but no definite edema
 or opacity is identified.  Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. The mediastinum
 is enlarged by fat deposition.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right than left.
 2.  Stable severe cardiomegaly.
