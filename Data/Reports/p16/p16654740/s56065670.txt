                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs including ___ and CT
 chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates massive cardiomegaly
 and pulmonary vascular congestion, consistent with congestive failure.  There
 is, however, also right infrahilar opacity and right upper lobe perifissural
 opacity, raising question of concurrent infection.  Within the left base is a
 lentiform opacity, which could be in part related to prominent pericardial fat
 pad in this location, although concurrent effusion or loculation cannot be
 excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with congestive heart failure and concerning
 for concurrent infection in the right upper and lower lobes.  Lentiform
 opacity in the left base could be further evaluated with dedicated PA and
 lateral radiographs when the patient is able; it is suspected to represent a
 fat pad but it is difficult to exclude a loculated pleural effusion based only
 on this image.
