                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lower lungs was partly excluded.  The heart appears enlarged
 but is incompletely assessed.  Allowing for differences in technique, the
 mediastinal contours are probably unchanged.  This view shows perihilar
 fullness and indistinct prominent pulmonary vascularity suggesting
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited view suggesting pulmonary edema.
 
 If a more complete evaluation for the possibility of pneumonia is needed, then
 additional radiographs could be performed, preferably with standard PA and
 lateral technique if possible clinically.
