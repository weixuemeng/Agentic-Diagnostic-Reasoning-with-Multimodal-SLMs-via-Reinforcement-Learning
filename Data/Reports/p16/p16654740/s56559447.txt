                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same day preceding radiograph from one hour ago.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates the ET tube 3.7 cm
 above the carina.  An enteric tube extends inferiorly into stomach and out of
 view.  Cardiomegaly is redemonstrated.  Pulmonary edema is worse.  There is
 now increased right pleural effusion, which may obscure underlying
 consolidations.  Again seen is a lentiform opacity in the left base which
 could be in part due to prominent pericardial fat pad, but could be further
 assessed with dedicated PA and lateral radiograph as previously recommended
 once patient is able.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Status post recent intubation with satisfactory position of ET tube and
 enteric tube.  No pneumothorax.
 2. Worsening pulmonary edema and increased right effusion.
