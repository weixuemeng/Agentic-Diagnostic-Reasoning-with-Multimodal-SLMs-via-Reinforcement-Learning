                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic breast cancer. Re-evaluate pleural
 effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.  CT
 of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior exam, the pigtail catheter has been removed from the right
 pleural space and there has been re-accumulation of a small right pleural
 effusion.  There is a tiny left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 A linear opacity in the right midlung zone likely represents atelectasis. The
 known small pulmonary metastases are not well evaluated on this chest
 radiograph. No large nodule or opacity is identified. There is no pulmonary
 edema. Compression deformities in the upper thoracic vertebral bodies are
 similar to the prior CT. Diffuse sclerotic osseous metastases are also
 redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right and tiny left pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
