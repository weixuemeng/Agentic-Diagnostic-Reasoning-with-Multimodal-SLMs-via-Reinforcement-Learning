                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with dyspnea, wheeze and history of breast
 cancer.  Evaluate for pneumonia or pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained.  In
 comparison to the prior examination, there is increased moderate right pleural
 effusion with adjacent dense opacification, likely representing compressive
 atelectasis, consolidation not excluded.  Small left pleural effusion and
 adjacent mild atelectasis, increased.  Multiple scattered pulmonary nodules,
 largest in the left upper lung, are relatively unchanged.  Surgical clips in
 the left lower chest are again noted.  A small well-rounded density projecting
 over the right scapula was not present on the prior study and could be
 external to the patient.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contour is
 otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased moderate right pleural effusion.  Adjacent confluent
 opacification may represent compressive atelectasis or airspace consolidation.
 
 2.  Increased small left pleural effusion and mild left basilar atelectasis.
 
 3.  Innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules as previoulsy described.
