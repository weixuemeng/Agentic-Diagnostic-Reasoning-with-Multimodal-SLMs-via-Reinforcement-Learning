                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with AML after allogenic
 stem cell transplantation with chronic pulmonary GVHD and new cough.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The central venous line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.  The
 spinal hardware is unchanged in appearance.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 stable.  Interval improvement in lung aeration is demonstrated with still
 present linear opacities in the right upper lung, right lower lobe, and left
 lower lung, that have substantially improved since the prior study and most
 likely reflect still present chronic changes related to known GVHD with
 resolution of the acute component.  No new consolidation to suggest
 intermittent development of acute process  appreciated on the current study. 
 There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  For precise
 assessment, chest CT might be considered.
