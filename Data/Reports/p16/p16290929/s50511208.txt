 FINDINGS:  Status post removal of right subclavian vascular catheter. 
 Widespread heterogeneous combined alveolar and interstitial opacities
 affecting the left lung to a greater degree than the right, have progressed in
 the interval, and may represent a multifocal pneumonia with or without
 coexisting pulmonary edema.  Pulmonary hemorrhage is also possible in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
