                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Retroperitoneal bleed and fluid, to assess for congestion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes accentuating the transverse diameter of the heart.  Central catheter
 and cervical fusion device are again seen.  There is suggestion of some
 increased opacification in the retrocardiac area with poor definition of the
 medial portion of the left hemidiaphragm.  This could represent some
 atelectatic change.  On the right, there is asymmetry and opacification in the
 mid lung zones, more prominent on the right.  This raises the possibility of
 consolidation in this region.
