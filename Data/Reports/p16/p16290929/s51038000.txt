 FINDINGS:  Right pleural effusion has decreased in size with associated
 improvement in adjacent right basilar atelectasis.  Multifocal areas of
 heterogeneous consolidation involving the left lung to a greater degree than
 the right, have slightly improved.  A small hyperlucency is present in the
 periphery of the left upper lobe at the level of the second and third anterior
 ribs, but no discrete visceral pleural line is identified.  This may represent
 an area of spared lung parenchyma from the presumed multifocal pneumonia, but
 attention to this area on short-term followup radiograph may be helpful to
 exclude an atypical presentation of pneumothorax, given clinical suspicion for
 this entity.
