                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 slightly better inspiration.  The pulmonary vascular congestion and areas of
 consolidation have substantially cleared.  There is some residual
 opacification in the right mid zone as well as in the retrocardiac area. 
 Findings could reflect atelectasis or supervening pneumonia.  The retrocardiac
 opacification most likely reflects substantial volume loss in the left lower
 lobe.
