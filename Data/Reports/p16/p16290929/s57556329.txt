                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there may be further
 increase in the bilateral pulmonary opacifications, especially at the right
 base.  The findings are again consistent with widespread pneumonia, though
 there could be some element of vascular congestion.  Extensive spinal fixation
 devices are again seen.
