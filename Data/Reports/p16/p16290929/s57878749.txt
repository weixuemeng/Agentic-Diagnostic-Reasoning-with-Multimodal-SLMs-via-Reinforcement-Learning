 PORTABLE CHEST
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are slightly lower compared to prior study. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for this factor. 
 Widespread heterogeneous pulmonary opacities affecting the left lung to a
 greater degree than the right have worsened in the lower lung since the prior
 study, and likely represent a multilobar pneumonia.  Small left and possible
 small right pleural effusions are unchanged.
