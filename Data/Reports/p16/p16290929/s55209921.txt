 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:38 PM
  INDICATION:  ___ year-old male with graft versus host disease with worsening
  dyspnea, here to evaluation for pleural effusion or pneumonia.
  
  COMPARISON:  Chest CT of ___ and chest radiograph of ___.
  
  FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show a right
  supraclavicular dual-channel catheter unchanged in position with the tip
  terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  Anterior cervical fixation hardware
  is unchanged.  The heart is top normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar
  contours are within normal limits and unchanged with a tortuous thoracic
  aorta.  The inspiratory lung volumes are persistently low with increased
  bibasilar atelectasis compared to ___.  A new linear opacity in the right
  mid lung likely represents atelectasis but followup is recommended.  No
  pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Mild pulmonary vascular
  congestion is noted.  
  
  IMPRESSION:  
  1.  Probable right mid lung atelectasis but followup is recommended.
  2.  Low lung volumes and increased bibasilar atelectasis.
  3.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
