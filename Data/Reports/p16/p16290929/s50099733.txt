                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Widespread combined alveolar and interstitial opacities affecting
 the left lung to a greater degree than the right have progressed in the
 interval, particularly in the right lower lung where there is also an
 increasing pleural effusion with adjacent consolidation and/or atelectasis. 
 Small left pleural effusion also appears increased from prior radiograph.
