                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and chest CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right sided dialysis catheter tip terminates in the low SVC.  Lung volumes are
 low.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no frank pulmonary
 edema is present.  Previously noted patchy opacities in the right upper lobe
 have improved.  There is worsening ill-defined opacification within the left
 lung base.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. 
 Bronchial wall thickening is most pronounced within the left lung base and
 likely reflective of bronchitis.  Areas of callus formation are noted
 involving multiple bilateral ribs.  Partially imaged is fusion hardware within
 the cervical and thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Worsening opacification in the left lung base with associated bronchial
 wall thickening concerning for infection.
 
 2. Slight interval improvement in previously noted airspace disease within the
 right upper lobe.
 
 3. No definite pulmonary edema.
