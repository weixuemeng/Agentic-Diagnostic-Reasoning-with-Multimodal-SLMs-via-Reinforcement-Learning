 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  AML, status post transplant, increasing hypoxia, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Parenchymal opacity in the periphery of the right upper lobe bases. 
 Relatively extensive left lower lobe atelectasis.  No overt pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusions, or newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.  Multiple
 vertebral fixation devices as well as the right hemodialysis catheter are in
 unchanged position.  The heart continues to be enlarged.
 
 The quality of the examination is limited by moderate-to-severe respiratory
 motion artifact.
