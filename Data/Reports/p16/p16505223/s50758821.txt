                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall.  Question stroke or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and scout view from PET-CT dated
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 There is mild-to-moderate unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Right perihilar
 opacification with volume loss in the right upper lobe as well as a mildly
 convex contour to the right upper mediastinal contour appear generally
 similar.  The only apparent change is a mild increase in patchy perihilar
 opacification on the right, probably due to minor atelectasis or treatment
 effect.  There is persistent volume loss at the right lung base with patchy
 medial basilar opacity suggesting minor atelectasis associated with prominent
 right-sided epicardial fat pad.  There is a very small pleural effusion on the
 right, not significantly changed versus. pleural thickening.  No pneumothorax
 is identified or pleural effusion on the left side.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of acute disease.  Mild apparent increased in
 right suprahilar opacification, which suggests atelectasis or
 treatment-related changes; however attention in follow-up cross sectional
 imaging surveillance studies is recommended.
