                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Low lung volumes may account for some of the
 prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart and mild fullness of the
 pulmonary vessels.  Nevertheless, there probably is some cardiomegaly as well
 as possibly some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 No convincing evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
