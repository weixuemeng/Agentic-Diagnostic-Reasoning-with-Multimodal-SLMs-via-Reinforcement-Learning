                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 6 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip is within the stomach. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is
 normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Patchy opacities in
 the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen on this supine exam. No acute osseous abnormalities
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Standard positions of the endotracheal and enteric tubes. Low lung volumes
 with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
