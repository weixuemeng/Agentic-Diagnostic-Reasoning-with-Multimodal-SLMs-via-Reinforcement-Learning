                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and nausea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Left shoulder radiographs ___ and chest radiograph
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Previous pattern of mild
 pulmonary edema has improved.  11 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left
 upper lung field remains unchanged.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax identified.  Comminuted fracture of the proximal left
 humerus seen is re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Resolution of the previously noted pulmonary edema.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2.  11 mm nodular opacity within the left upper lung field, for which a
 nonemergent chest CT is recommended for further assessment, as was noted on
 the prior shoulder radiographs.  
 
 3.  Re- demonstration of comminuted fracture of the left proximal humerus.
