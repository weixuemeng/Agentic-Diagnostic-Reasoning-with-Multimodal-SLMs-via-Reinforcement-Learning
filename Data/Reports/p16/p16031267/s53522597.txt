  1. Sequential frontal radiographs of the chest and upper abdomen demonstrate
  placement of an enteric tube, with final position of the distal tip overlying
  the gastric body.
  2. Stable position of the left sided central venous catheter with distal tip
  projecting over the low SVC versus cavoatrial junction.
  3. Interval removal of an ET tube.
  4. There is a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette, along with
  centrally-predominant fluffy airspace opacities, and suggestion of a
  interlobular septal thickening most apparent at the peripheral right lung,
  compatible pulmonary vascular congestion and mild volume overload.
  5. More conspicuous airspace opacity in the right lower lung is again seen,
  possibly sequela of aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with seizures s/p fall and intraparenchymal
 contusions now s/p dobhoff placement  // dobhoff placement   Contact name:
 ___, ___: ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph of ___, serial radiographs
 document placement of a feeding tube into the body of the stomach. Exam is
 otherwise remarkable for worsening bilateral asymmetrically distributed
 alveolar opacities, which could be due to multifocal aspiration and or
 developing infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
