  In comparison to recent same-day prior chest radiograph from 17:13, the
  current radiograph demonstrates an enteric tube with distal radiopaque tip
  projecting over the the approximate location of the gastric body with
  side-port approximately 8 cm distal to the GE junction, in grossly appropriate
  location.  Otherwise, no significant interval change.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx of seizures s/p fall s/p dobhoff tube
 placement; pt self dislodged tube during attempted bridle, needs repeat CXR
 for position prior to using  // dobhoff tube replacement- assess position  
 Contact name: ___, ___: ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Radiographs obtained for assessment of feeding tube placement demonstrate a
 feeding tube terminating in the body of the stomach.  Within the imaged
 portion of the chest, asymmetrically distributed alveolar opacities affecting
 the right lung to a greater degree than the left are again demonstrated,
 incompletely evaluated due to incomplete imaging of the chest.
