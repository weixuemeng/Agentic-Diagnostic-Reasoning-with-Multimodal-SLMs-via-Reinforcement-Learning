                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female mechanical small.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and portable views of the chest are limited due to patient's body habitus. 
 With this limitation in mind no displaced fracture is seen.  The lungs are
 clear.  Cardiac silhouette is top-normal in size.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited due to underpenetration due to the patient's body habitus without
 evidence of displaced fracture.  If clinical concern remains high, suggest
 dedicated imaging of the site of concern.
