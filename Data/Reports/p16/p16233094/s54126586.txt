                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is mild to moderately enlarged,
 accentuated by low lung volumes.  The aorta is tortuous.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Linear and patchy opacities in the lung bases
 are most compatible with areas of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Moderate degenerative changes
 are seen within the thoracic spine.  Surgical anchors project over the right
 humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
