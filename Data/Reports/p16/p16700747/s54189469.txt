                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and chest tightness for two weeks with no improvement after
 three days of azithromycin.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Low lung volumes due to incomplete
 inspiration have caused crowding of the pulmonary vasculature and vertical
 compression of the cardiomediastinal structures.  The lungs are clear.  The
 hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normal radiograph of the chest with no evidence of pneumonia.
