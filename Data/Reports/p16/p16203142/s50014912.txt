 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube lies below the
 thoracic inlet, approximately 5 cm above the carina; previously it closely
 approached the carina.  An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, its
 distal course not imaged.  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is a focal hazy
 opacification projecting over the left upper lung while the left lung base
 appears clear.  Although a confounding factor is moderate rightward convex
 scoliosis, there is a suggestion of mild volume loss with leftward shift of
 mediastinal structures.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Hazy appearance of left upper lung with suspected volume loss, an
 appearance suggesting extensive atelectasis of the left upper lobe.
