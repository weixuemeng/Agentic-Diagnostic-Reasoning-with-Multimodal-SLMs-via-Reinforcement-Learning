                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left lower lobe pneumonia, evaluate interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 4:29 a.m., there has been improvement in the right
 base opacity, with only minimal residual opacity now seen at the right base. 
 There is also improvement of the opacity at the left base, at least in part
 related to improvement in effusion.  Dense retrocardiac opacity persists,
 consistent with persistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. 
 There is upper zone redistribution, but there has been improvement in CHF
 findings.  
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 6.9 cm above the carina.  An NG-type
 tube is present, extending beneath diaphragm, coiled over the stomach and
 extending off the film.  Spinal scoliosis and spinal rods again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Interval improvement in CHF findings, effusions, and right base opacity.
 Vascular plethora still noted, but improved. Persistent dense left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.
