                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Re-intubation, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to previous radiograph, the patient still carries an
 endotracheal tube.  The tip of the tube projects 3.8 cm above the carina. 
 Course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable.  
 
 There is unchanged evidence of a relatively extensive left lung parenchymal
 opacity that is exaggerated on today's radiograph given patient positioning. 
 The pre-existing right middle and lower lung opacity is constant.  Unchanged
 position of the vertebral stabilization devices.  The contour of the cardiac
 silhouette cannot be delineated on the current image.
