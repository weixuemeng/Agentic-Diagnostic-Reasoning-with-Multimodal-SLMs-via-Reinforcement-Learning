                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute desaturation with history of endocardial cushion defect.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube has
 been removed.  There is substantial increase in opacification involving the
 left hemithorax, some of which could reflect rotation of the patient to this
 side.  However, there has been obliteration of the left hemidiaphragm and
 costophrenic angle, consistent with substantial volume loss and pleural
 effusion.  The right lung is relatively clear with some residual opacification
 at the base.
 
 This information has been conveyed to Dr. ___ by telephone at 8:20 a.m. on
