 INDICATION:  ___F w hx R-L carotid-carotid bypass/L carotid-subclavian
 transposition and thoracic aortic stent graft ___ now p/w subacute LLE
 ischemia ___ extensive ilio/femoral/popliteal disease  // dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA torso ___.  Chest radiographs ___

 3. New mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Clinical correlation and imaging follow-up is recommended.
