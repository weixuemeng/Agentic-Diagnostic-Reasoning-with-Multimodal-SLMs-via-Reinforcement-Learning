 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette is moderately enlarged, which may be due to underlying
 cardiomyopathy and/or pericardial effusion.  There is bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to small pleural
 effusion.  There is minimal pulmonary vascular congestion without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which may be due
 to cardiomyopathy and/or pericardial effusion.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
