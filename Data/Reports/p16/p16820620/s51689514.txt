                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with productive cough; history of Wegener's and
 chronic lung disease; recent hx treatment for LLL penumonia  // r/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  MULTIPLE PRIOR RADIOGRAPHS THE MOST RECENT ON ___. 
 Chest CT on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is moderately enlarged, but stable from the prior examination.  The
 aorta is tortuous and calcified.  Chronic scarring involving the left upper
 lobe is not changed in appearance and is better characterized on recent CT
 from ___.  A left lower lobe opacity is improved from the prior
 radiographs on ___ and likely represents a combination of scarring
 and possible resolving infection in that area.  Right upper lobe opacities,
 presumably due to fibrosis, are also not significantly changed.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No new focal consolidation is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral upper lobe opacities are stable are most consistent with scarring,
 better characterized on prior CT examinations on ___ and ___.  Left
 lower lobe opacity is minimally improved from the prior radiographs on ___ and likely represents a combination of scarring and improving
 infection in that area.  Given the patient's multifocal areas of scarring and
 opacity, acute infection is difficult to exclude on radiography.  Given that,
 no definite new focal consolidation is identified.
