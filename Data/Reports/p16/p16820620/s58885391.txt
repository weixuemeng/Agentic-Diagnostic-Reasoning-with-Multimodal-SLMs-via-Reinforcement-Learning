                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, bibasilar crackles
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is top normal, unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are similar with leftward shift of mediastinal structures again
 demonstrated. Chronic volume loss is again seen in the left lung with scarring
 re- demonstrated in both upper lobes and pleural thickening noted over the
 left apex, unchanged. Traction bronchiectasis is also demonstrated in the left
 upper lobe with bronchial wall thickening.  New hazy opacification is seen
 within the left lung, findings could which could reflect pulmonary vascular
 congestion which is asymmetric. Streaky opacity in the right lung base is
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is demonstrated. No acute
 osseous abnormalities demonstrated.  Chronic deformity of a left-sided rib is
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hazy opacification in the left lung, new from the prior study, could reflect
 asymmetric pulmonary edema though infection is not completely excluded. 
 Chronic changes in both upper lobes with biapical scarring, left apical
 traction bronchiectasis and pleural thickening.
