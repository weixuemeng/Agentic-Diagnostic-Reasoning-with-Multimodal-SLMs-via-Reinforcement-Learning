                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CTA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  Superior hilar retraction with scarring, bronchiectasis, and
 architectural distortion is noted within the left upper lobe, with unchanged
 chronic volume loss in the left hemi thorax.  Patchy left basilar opacity and
 right upper lobe nodular opacification also are unchanged, and may reflect
 chronic interstitial lung disease related to vasculitis though increased
 atelectasis or infection of the left lung base is not excluded. Blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle is unchanged, and no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 Compression deformity of the T12 vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic interstitial lung disease related to vasculitis, not substantially
 changed in the interval except for increased patchy left basilar opacity, for
 which worsening atelectasis or infection may be present.
