 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with prior radiograph, there is a new hazy patchy

 chronic changes including severe apical scarring which is more prominent on
 the left and traction to the left side are stable.  Again seen is stable
 elevation of the hila bilaterally related to fibrotic changes.  Cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  The aorta is tortuous.
 
 There is demineralization of the spine without evidence of comparison.

 right lower lobe, new from prior exam and most likely represents intervening
 superinfection.  Recommend followup after treatment.
