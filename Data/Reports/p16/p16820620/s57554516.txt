 increase in heterogeneous opacification of the left lung, with more
 consolidative retrocardiac opacity containing air bronchograms, is most
 consistent with left lower lobe pneumonia.  Additionally, there has been
 interval development of the moderate-sized left pleural effusion.  The heart
 remains enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  No pneumothorax.
