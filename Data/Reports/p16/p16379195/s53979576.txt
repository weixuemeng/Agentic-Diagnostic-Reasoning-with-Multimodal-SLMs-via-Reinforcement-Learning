                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Lungs are hyperinflated in keeping
 with history of COPD.  Lower lobe predominant bronchial wall thickening is
 present with improving adjacent peribronchiolar opacities, which may be due to
 resolving aspiration or improving infection in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  No new areas of lung consolidation are evident.
