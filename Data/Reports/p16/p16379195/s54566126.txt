                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation. Evaluation for ETT position.
 
 COMPARISON: None.
 
 FINDINGS: Supine portable views of the chest demonstrate opacification of the
 right lung base, consistent with aspiration.  There is also a minimally
 displaced posterior rib fracture on the right, of indeterminate age.  There is
 no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.  An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in
 appropriate positions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right lung base opacity, concerning for aspiration.
 2.  Right posterior rib fracture of indeterminate age.  Support and monitoring
 devices in appropriate position.
