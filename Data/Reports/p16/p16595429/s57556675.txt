                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, hypotension  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  Sternotomy wires are well aligned. 
 Surgical clips overlie the mediastinum and right upper lung field.  Allowing
 for AP projection and rotation, the heart is upper limits of normal.  Lung
 volumes are mildly decreased.  Patchy and linear opacities are present at the
 left lung base.  .  There is no lobar consolidation, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema.  Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be
 secondary to pleural thickening or trace pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy and linear left basilar opacities favor atelectasis over infectious
 pneumonia.  If clinical suspicion for pneumonia persists, short-term followup
 radiographs may be helpful.  .
