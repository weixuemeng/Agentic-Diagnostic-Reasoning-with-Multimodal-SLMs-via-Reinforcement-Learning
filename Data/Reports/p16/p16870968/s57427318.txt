                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The exam is
 underpenetrated due to patient body habitus, making evaluation, particularly
 at the left lung base, suboptimal.  Given this, there is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 enlarged, which may in part be due to AP technique and shallow inspiration. 
 However, the mediastinal contours appear sharp.  No definite focal
 consolidation is seen; however, a basilar consolidation would be difficult to
 exclude on this study.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
