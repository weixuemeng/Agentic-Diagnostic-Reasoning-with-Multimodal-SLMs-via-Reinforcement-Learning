                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with biventricular permanent pacemaker insertion.  Assess
 lead position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  Pacemaker box is altered in position slightly from prior study. 
 Pacemaker leads appear in unchanged position.  There is no good evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There is some blunting of both costophrenic sulci and possibly
 a small amount of atelectasis projecting behind the left heart border.  There
 is no convincing evidence of failure, although a subtle interstitial fibrosis
 is not immediately excluded despite the adequate lung volumes.
 
 Lateral view shows right atrial and right ventricular lead positioning with
 pacing wires projected posteriorly presumptively within the coronary sinus.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Satisfactory lead placement. No evidence of procedural
 complication
