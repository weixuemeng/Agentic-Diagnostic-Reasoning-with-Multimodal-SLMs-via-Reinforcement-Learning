                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Interstitial lung disease, night sweats.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal, minimally enlarged since the prior study.  Aorta is
 tortuous but unchanged.  There is no evidence of lymphadenopathy within the
 limitations of this study technique.  As compared to the prior study, there is
 slight interval progression of interstitial lung disease as noted along the
 periphery of the lungs with mild apical basal gradient.  No focal
 consolidations demonstrated.  No pleural effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings concerning for interval progression of interstitial lung disease that
 if clinically warranted can be further assessed with high-resolution chest CT.
