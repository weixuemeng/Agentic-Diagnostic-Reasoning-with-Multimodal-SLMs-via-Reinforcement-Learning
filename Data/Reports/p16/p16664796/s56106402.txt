                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB, fever  // PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph with the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 On the lateral, there is increased opacification overlying the lower thoracic
 spine, which is not definitively localized on the AP, but is concerning for
 developing pneumonia.  Linear opacification within the left midlung likely
 represents atelectasis.  Pulmonary vascular congestion, but no overt pulmonary
 edema.  Stable enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased opacification over the the lower thoracic spine, not definitively
 localized on the AP, but concerning for developing pneumonia.
 2. Pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions.
