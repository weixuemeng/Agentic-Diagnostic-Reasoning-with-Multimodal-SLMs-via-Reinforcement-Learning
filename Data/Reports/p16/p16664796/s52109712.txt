                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior CTA of the chest from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Right rib pain status post fall.  Assess for fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung volumes are
 low which somewhat limits the evaluation.  There is a linear density in the
 right perihilar region likely representing atelectasis.  A dense nodule in the
 left lower lung corresponds to a calcified granuloma on prior CT.  Adjacent
 linear density likely represents scarring and appears unchanged.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No definite displaced rib fracture is seen.
 No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite rib fracture.
