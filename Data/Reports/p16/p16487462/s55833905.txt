                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fem pop bypass now s/p fall while walking 
 // eval fractures
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest radiograph with PA and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No fracture is identified. There is an asymmetrical focal opacity overlying
 the right seventh anterior rib on the PA view which is not seen on lateral
 view.  It is uncertain whether this represents superimposition of soft tissue
 structures or a discrete lung parenchymal process such as focal contusion.
 There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There
 is no free air below the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No fracture is identified.
 2.  Nonspecific opacity overlying the right seventh anterior rib, possibly
 localized contusion given history of fall.  Short-term followup is recommended
 to ensure resolution.
