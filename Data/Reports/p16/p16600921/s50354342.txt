  Orogastric tube with tip below the diaphragm, however the tip is not included
  on this examination.  Lung volumes have decreased.  There is worsening of
  right basilar opacity, which may reflect atelectasis, however an underlying
  infectious process cannot be excluded.  There is interval worsening of
  pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, nasogastric tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in
 severity of the pre-existing pulmonary edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
 There also is increasing evidence of atelectasis at the lung bases.  The lung
 volumes remain low.  In the interval, the patient has received a nasogastric
 tube.  The tip of the tube is not included on the image.  The sidehole
 projects 8 cm below the gastroesophageal junction.  A left hemodialysis
 catheter remains in unchanged position.  No pneumothorax.
