                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough.  Assess for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lower most left chest and left costophrenic angle are excluded from the
 film.  The patient is imaged with his left arm raised.
 
 
 The lungs are moderately well inflated.  The heart may be slightly enlarged,
 but the cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged, with minimal unfolding of the
 aorta and aortic calcification noted.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, right pleural
 effusion, or gross left pleural effusion is identified.  No pneumothorax
 detected.  Linear hyper density projecting over the lingula is not
 significantly changed dating back to ___.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen shows residual contrast in the colon. 
 Equivocal hyperlucency could be an artifact due to overlapping loops of bowel.
 No free air seen beneath the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute pulmonary process identified.  In particular, no focal infiltrate
 to suggest pneumonia.
 2.  Residual oral contrast noted in non-distended loops of colon.
 3.  Relative hyperlucency in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, with well
 delineated loops of bowel, is likely an artifact due to overlapping loops of
 bowel.  However, it raises the question ___ ___'s sign (free intraperitoneal
 air).  If the the patient has abdominal symptoms, then dedicated abdominal
 radiographs or CT would be recommended to further assess for free
 intra-abdominal air.  No free air seen beneath the diaphragm:  What is labeled
 as an upright film (though no actual fluid level seen to confirm this).
