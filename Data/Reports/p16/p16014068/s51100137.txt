                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with fall and cerebellar hemorrhage.  History of
 malignant sarcoma of the right proximal femur.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and CT chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, causing bronchovascular crowding and accentuation of the
 heart size.  Multiple scattered, rounded opacities in the left perihilar
 region and right lower lobe are consistent with known pulmonary nodules
 representing advanced metastatic disease.  The right-sided Port-A-Cath tip
 projects at the region of the cavoatrial junction.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Multiple bilateral rounded pulmonary nodular densities are compatible with
 known advanced metastatic disease.
 
 2.  No discrete focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No
 pneumothorax.
