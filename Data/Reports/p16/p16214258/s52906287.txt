                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Treatment for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images are available for comparison.  On the current
 study, there is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  Cardiac silhouette is
 within normal limits and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion. 
 There is a slight impression on the lower cervical trachea on the right,
 raising the possibility of a thyroid mass.
