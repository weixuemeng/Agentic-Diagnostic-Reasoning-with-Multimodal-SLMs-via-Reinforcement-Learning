                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Melanoma status post recent therapy, presenting with tenderness and
 pleuritic chest pain as well as dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  prior radiographs from ___ or chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  A
 central venous catheter has been removed.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Streaky opacities in the right upper and left mid-to-lower lung
 suggest minor atelectasis.  A lucent area projecting over the right lower lung
 is probably postoperative and appears unchanged.  This study suggests the
 presence of many nodules ranging from small to moderate size scattered
 throughout each lung.  This includes a new substantial opacity of oval shape
 measuring up to 36 mm in length projecting over the right mid lung.  The
 findings were not present on recent prior studies suggesting rapid progression
 of metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Numerous new nodular opacities suggesting metastases.  No
 definite indication of an infectious process.  The possibility that the
 dominant lesion in the lateral right lung may be infectious could be
 considered, however, although probably metastatic.  Chest CT may be helpful to
 assess further if needed clinically.
