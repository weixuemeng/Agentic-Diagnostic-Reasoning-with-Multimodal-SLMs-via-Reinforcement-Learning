                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the right chest
 tube has been removed.  There is a small residual pneumothorax.  The patient
 has taken a much better inspiration, although there are still atelectatic
 changes at the bases.
