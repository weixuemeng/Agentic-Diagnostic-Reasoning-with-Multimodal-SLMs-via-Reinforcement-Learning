                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Mild dyspnea on exertion.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Current radiograph demonstrates top normal heart, stable since the prior
 study.  Mediastinum is stable.  Lungs are essentially clear.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No abnormalities seen within the limitations of this study
 technique to explain patient's symptoms, correlation with chest CT might be
 considered if clinically warranted.  Prominence of the main pulmonary artery
 is noted and might potentially reflect pulmonary hypertension that also may be
 assessed by echocardiography or chest CT.
