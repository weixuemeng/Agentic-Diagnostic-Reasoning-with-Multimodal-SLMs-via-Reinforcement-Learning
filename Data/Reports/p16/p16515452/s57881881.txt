                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with multiple myeloma, pre-bone marrow
 transplant evaluation.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormality is
 identified.  Mild degree of widening and elongation of the thoracic aorta is
 noted; however, no evidence of local contour abnormalities is present.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates are present. There exists, however, a small
 intra-hilar calcification and some linear densities in the direction of the
 left upper lobe probably representing old scar formations.  Similar linear
 densities are also noted in the right apical area but nowhere is there any
 evidence of any acute infectious process.  The lateral view discloses a
 moderate accentuation of the kyphotic curvature in the thoracic spine and
 diffuse demineralization of the vertebral bodies.  Significant compression
 fracture is noted in a vertebral body of the mid portion, probably T7
 overlying linear dense structures suggestive of a previous interventional
 procedure.  Osteopenic vertebral bodies with depressed central plates are
 noted in the lower half of the thoracic spine.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.  The described pulmonary changes are probably residuals from old
 specific apical infections.  The skeletal findings are suggestive of rather
 advanced osteoporosis.
 
 It is noted that the patient is scheduled for a chest CT examination on the
 same date.
