                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Wheezing, dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  There is right apical scarring.  Nodular
 abnormalities are seen in the left lung base, more dense today than on prior
 exam, possibly representing mucoid impaction.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Mid-thoracic
 and lumbar vertebroplasty changes are noted, similar to prior exam.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Nodular abnormalities in the left lung base, more dense today than on prior
 exam, possibly representing mucoid impaction.  Recommend either chest CT for
 further characterization or repeat chest radiographs after epmiric treatment
 for mucous plugging and bronchiectasis.
