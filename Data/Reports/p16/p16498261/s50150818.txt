 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, mainly due to projection effects in a
 slightly rotated patient.  No evidence of pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusions.  Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta persists.
