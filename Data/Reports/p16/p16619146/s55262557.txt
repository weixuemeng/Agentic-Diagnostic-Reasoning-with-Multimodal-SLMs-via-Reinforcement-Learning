                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p AVR, CABG- CTs d/c'd  // evaluate for
 pneumothorax      evaluate for pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 have been removed except for the right IJ catheter, which extends into the
 right atrium.  Following chest tube removal, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion has decreased.  Increased
 opacification at the left base could merely represent atelectasis and small
 effusion, though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
 There is lucency running vertically in the sternum, which can be a normal
 finding at this stage following sternal splitting procedure.  Persistence of
 this finding could raise the possibility of dehiscence.
