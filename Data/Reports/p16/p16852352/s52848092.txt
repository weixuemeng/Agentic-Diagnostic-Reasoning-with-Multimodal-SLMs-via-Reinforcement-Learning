                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with focal neurological findings.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia or mass.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unremarkable.  Low lung volumes are noted bilaterally with crowding of
 bronchovascular markings.  Opacification at the right lung base may represent
 atelectasis versus aspiration; infectious process cannot be completely
 excluded in the correct clinical setting but is less likely. Opacification in
 the left lung base likely represents atelectasis.
