                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Decreasing oxygen saturation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes.  Bibasilar atelectasis persists, more prominent on the right.  Upper
 lung zones are clear without vascular congestion.
 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests a small pleural effusion on
 this side.
