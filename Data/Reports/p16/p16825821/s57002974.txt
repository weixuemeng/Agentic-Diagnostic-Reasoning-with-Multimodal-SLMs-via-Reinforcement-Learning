 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Intermittent chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Patchy
 lingular opacity is probably due to minor scarring.  Otherwise, the lungs
 appear clear.  Moderate degenerative changes are noted along the thoracic
 spine.
