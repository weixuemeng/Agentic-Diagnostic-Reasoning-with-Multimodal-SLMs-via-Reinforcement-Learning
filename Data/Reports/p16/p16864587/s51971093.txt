                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening low back pain.  Has a history of L3-4 epidural and
 retroperitoneal abscess, status post surgery.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of
 three exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left PICC terminates in the upper SVC.  In comparison with the
 prior exam, it appears to be slightly pulled back.  A small metallic density
 overlies the left apex and appears to be within the subcutaneous tissue on the
 lateral view.  It is unchanged.  Cervical spine hardware is partially imaged,
 and unchanged.
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The lungs are clear without a focal airspace
 consolidation or pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The osseous
 structures are unremarkable; specifically, vertebral body height is maintained
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  PICC in the upper SVC.
 2.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
