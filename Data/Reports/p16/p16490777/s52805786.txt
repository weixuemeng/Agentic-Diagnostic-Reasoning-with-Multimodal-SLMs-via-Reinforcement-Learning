                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dizziness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Streaky opacities at the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged, with crowding of the bronchovascular structures
 likely related to low inspiratory effort.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
