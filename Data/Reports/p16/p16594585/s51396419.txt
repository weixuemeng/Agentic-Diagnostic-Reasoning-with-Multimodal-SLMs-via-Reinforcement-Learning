                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dry cough for 2 weeks with history of bronchiectasis.  Evaluate for
 an infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are hyperexpanded.  There
 is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation. 
 Fibrosis and bronchiectasis in the right perihilar region is similar to prior
 but better characterized on the prior CT.  Heart is top normal size. 
 Thickening of the right paratracheal stripe reflects underlying vasculature
 rather than a mass, as demonstrated on the prior CT.
