                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic CA and worsening dyspnea  //
 e/o PNA, PTx, progression R effusion      e/o PNA, PTx, progression R effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is further increase in the
 large right pleural effusion.  The known right hilar mass and postradiation
 changes were much better demonstrated on the CT examination of ___.  In
 view of the extensive changes in the lower half of the right lung, it would be
 impossible to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
 There is apical pleural capping on the right but no evidence of pneumothorax.
