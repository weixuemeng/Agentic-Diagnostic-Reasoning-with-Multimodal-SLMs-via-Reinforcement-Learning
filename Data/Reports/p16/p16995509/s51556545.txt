                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with NSCLC and recurrent pleural effusions.
 Febrile neutropenia.  // ? pleural fluid reaccumulation. ?PNA. ?Pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the low SVC.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  Known right hilar mass is re- demonstrated and
 unchanged compared to multiple prior studies.  Linear opacities extending from
 the hilum to the right mid lung consistent with radiation fibrosis changes. 
 Persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged compared to prior
 study and likely represents volume loss.  Small right pleural effusion is
 unchanged compared to prior study.  There is persistent pleural thickening
 along the right lung apex.
 No focal consolidation or pulmonary edema is noted.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.
 2. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged compared to most recent prior
 study, however decreased compared to multiple previous studies.
 3. Known right hilar mass, radiation fibrosis changes, and persistent
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged and more fully evaluated by
 a recent chest CTA of ___.
 4. Stable pleural thickening along the right lung apex.
