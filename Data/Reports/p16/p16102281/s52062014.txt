                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG and stent placement.  Heart
 size is normal.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Low lung volumes are present which results in crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures.  There are minimal ill-defined streaky and
 nodular opacities in the lung bases.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  There is no frank pulmonary edema.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Minimal streaky and ill-defined nodular opacities in the
 lung bases could reflect atelectasis though infection is not completely
 excluded.  No overt pulmonary edema.
