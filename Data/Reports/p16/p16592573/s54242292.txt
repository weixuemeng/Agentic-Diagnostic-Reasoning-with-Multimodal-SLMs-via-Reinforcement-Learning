                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Decompensated cirrhosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes with possible increased size of the cardiac silhouette. 
 Indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Poor definition of the right hemidiaphragm with
 opacification above it could reflect developing consolidation.  There is also
 blunting of the costophrenic angle on this side, consistent with pleural
 fluid.
 
 Ill-defined area of increased opacification in the left upper zone could
 represent merely congestion, though again in the appropriate clinical
 situation, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
