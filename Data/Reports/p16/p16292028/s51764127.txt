                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain this morning.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  On the frontal
 exam, the lungs are clear.  However, on the lateral, there is increased
 opacity projecting over the spine.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear and the
 costophrenic angles are sharp.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Subtle increased opacity in the lateral view projecting over the
 spine, potentially atelectasis given lack of findings on the frontal view,
 however repeat exam with better inspiratory effort can be performed to further
 evaluate.
