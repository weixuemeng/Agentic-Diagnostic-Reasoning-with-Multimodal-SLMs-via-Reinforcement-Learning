 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the recent study of one day earlier, there has been
 minimal change in the appearance of the chest.  Linear atelectasis in the
 lingula has slightly worsened, and a new focus of linear atelectasis has
 developed at the right base.  Otherwise, no relevant interval change.
