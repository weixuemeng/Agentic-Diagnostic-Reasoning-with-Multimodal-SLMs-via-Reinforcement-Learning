 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 7:43
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia, assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 3:23.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 7:43 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  Interval extubation.  Interval removal of the left
 internal jugular central line and nasogastric tube.  There is left pleural
 effusion with some patchy associated airspace disease, likely reflecting
 compressive atelectasis.  There is slightly prominent interstitium in the
 periphery of the right lung as well as a suggestion of some bronchial cuffing.
 These findings likely reflect mild interstitial edema.  No pneumothorax.
