                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fevers and dysphagia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Blunting of the left lateral
 costophrenic angle is unchanged, potentially due to atelectasis.  Posterior
 costophrenic angles are sharp without evidence of effusion.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear without focal consolidation.  The right apical pleural-based
 thickening is again seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are identified as well
 as possible coronary artery stent.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
