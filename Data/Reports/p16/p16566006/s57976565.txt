                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a new fever after fall.  Suspect pneumonia. 
 Evaluate for rib fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 I do not see a displaced rib fracture, but conventional chest radiograph,
 particularly performed bedside, is not sensitive for detecting any but gross
 chest cage trauma.  If there are focal findings, detailed views of those areas
 should be requested.
 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Lungs are clear and heart is
 normal size.
