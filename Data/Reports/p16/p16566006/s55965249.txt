                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia with O2 sats of 77%, here to evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are low, decreased from ___.  Left
 basilar opacities may represent atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes
 although infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical context.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy with multiple intact sternal wires. 
 The thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous.  Multiple mediastinal surgical clips
 are compatible with prior CABG surgery.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with left basilar atelectasis versus developing
 infection.  Conventional radiographs including a lateral radiograph is
 recommended when the patient is able.
