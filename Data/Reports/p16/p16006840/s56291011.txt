                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with HCV, cirrhosis, DM2, HTN, polysubstance abuse
 presenting with AMS, fall today, leukocytosis, troponin elevation, new ___. 
 // please evaluate heart size and for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 11:___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is borderline enlarged though this is likely accentuated due to low
 lung volumes. The mediastinal contour is unremarkable. There is crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures, without overt pulmonary edema demonstrated.
 Streaky opacities are noted in both lung bases.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present. A VP shunt catheter is partially imaged, projecting
 over the right chest.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with streaky bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis, but
 infection cannot be completely excluded.
