                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory distress. Technician alredy on
 floor.,  // ? pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC terminates in the lower SVC, unchanged.  Diffuse relatively
 homogeneous opacification in the right lung most likely represents asymmetric
 pulmonary edema. More confluent opacities at the right base could represent
 atelectasis or consolidation. Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema predominantly involving the
 right lung.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
