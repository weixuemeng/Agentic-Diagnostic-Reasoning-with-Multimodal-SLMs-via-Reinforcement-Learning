                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with altered mental status.  Evaluate for acute
 pulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right Port-A-Cath is new and its tip projects over the expected region of
 the distal SVC.  The NG tube has been removed in the interim.  Detailed
 evaluation of the right apex is limited secondary to overlying soft tissue
 from the patient's chin being flexed.  Bilateral parenchymal airspace
 opacities involving most of the right lower and mid hemithorax as well as the
 left lower hemi thorax are new and more extensive on the right.  The upper
 lungs are relatively spared.  There is a layering right pleural effusion. No
 left pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size.  No
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New bilateral, right greater than left parenchymal airspace opacities are most
 concerning for multi focal aspiration or diffuse infectious pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical situation.
 
 Layering right effusion.
