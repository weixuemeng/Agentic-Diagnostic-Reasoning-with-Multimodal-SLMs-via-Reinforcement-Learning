                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with PMH of HLH (s/p etoposide in remission), relapsed
 refractory secondary AML (s/p non-myeloablative MRD Allo SCT with FLU/BU for
 conditioning (D0=___, s/p DLI ___), baseline bronchiectasis, chronic
 pseudomonal pneumonia, who was admitted on ___ with febrile neutropenia, found
 to be in blast crisis, developed septic shock with FICU course, now
 transferred to ___.  // eval for effusion, consolidation, interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Right PICC terminates in the mid SVC,
 unchanged.  Increased opacification at the right and to a lesser extent left
 base may represent worsening pulmonary edema however superimposed
 consolidation cannot exclude.  There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to the prior examination there is increased opacification at the
 right base and to a lesser extent left base which could reflect slightly
 increased pulmonary edema however superimposed consolidation, particularly at
 the right base, cannot be excluded and should be considered in the appropriate
 clinical context.
