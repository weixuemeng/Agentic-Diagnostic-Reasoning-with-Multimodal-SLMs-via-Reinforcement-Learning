                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  Again seen is consolidation in the lingula
 which on the lateral view appears minimally improved.  There is however more
 conspicuous opacity in the right mid to lower lung, likely localizing to the
 lower lobe on the lateral exam.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits noting calcified mediastinal nodes.  No acute osseous abnormality
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent lingular pneumonia with perhaps developing right lower lobe
 infection on the current exam as well.  Recommend repeat after treatment to
 document resolution.
