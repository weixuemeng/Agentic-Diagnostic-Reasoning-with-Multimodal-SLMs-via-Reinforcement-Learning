                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with HLH status post chemotherapy with multiple
 pseudomonal pneumonias and worsening cough.  Evaluate for new abnormalities.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray performed ___, and CT chest performed
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate interval clearing
 of previously noted areas of peribronchovascular abnormality in the bilateral
 lower lobes.  Within the right upper lobe, there is new faint
 peribronchovascular airspace opacity.  There is no focal consolidation, or
 abscess.  There is no pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size, the mediastinal contours are notable for
 unchanged calcified lymphadenopathy.  Lingular and right middle lobe
 bronchiectasis is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Interval improvement in bibasilar airspace opacities, with interval
 increase in an ill-defined peribronchovascular opacity in the right mid lung. 
 This is nonspecific but might reflect an infectious or inflammatory process,
 and if indicated could be better evaluated with CT.
 
 2.  No change in bronchiectasis in the anterior right middle lobe, and
 lingula.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 2:30 p.m.
