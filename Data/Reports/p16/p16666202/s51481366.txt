                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with history of acute cholangitis, now with
 increasing oxygen requirement, here to evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day at 01:55 p.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is stable elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and increased
 opacification of the right lung base, most compatible with atelectasis.  There
 is plate-like atelectasis at the left costophrenic angle.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and mildly
 increased right basilar atelectasis.
