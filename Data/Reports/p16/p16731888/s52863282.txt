                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with aspiration PNA  // R/O acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is elevation the left hemidiaphragm, to a lesser extent than on the
 prior study, with overlying atelectasis.  Patchy left base opacity is most
 likely due to atelectasis, underlying aspiration not excluded.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable and unremarkable..
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated, but to a significantly lesser
 degree than on the prior study.  Streaky left base opacity is most likely due
 to atelectasis, underlying aspiration not excluded.
