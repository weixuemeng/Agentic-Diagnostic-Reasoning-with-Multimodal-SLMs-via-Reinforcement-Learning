                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman movement of CVL  // ? location of CVL      ?
 location of CVL
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the left subclavian
 catheter extends to the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and left
 subclavian, essentially unchanged from the previous study.  Continued low lung
 volumes with the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion appearing more
 prominent on this examination.
