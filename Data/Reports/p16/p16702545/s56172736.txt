                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited due to positioning.  The endotracheal tube ends 3.6 cm
 above the carina. An NG tube is in place with the tip out of view.
 
 Lung volumes are low. There is bilateral hilar engorgement and pulmonary
 edema. Apparent mediastinal widening may be due to positioning. Patchy
 opacities in the retrocardiac region in both the right and the left aspects of
 the heart may represent atelectasis although infiltrative process cannot be
 excluded. There may be a small layering left-sided pleural effusion. No
 right-sided pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal and NG tubes in appropriate position.
 
 2.  Pulmonary edema.
 
 3. Patchy opacities in both lung bases may represent atelectasis although
 infiltrative process cannot be excluded.
