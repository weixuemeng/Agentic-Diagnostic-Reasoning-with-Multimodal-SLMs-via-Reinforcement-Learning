                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with critical limb ischemia and CHF with possible
 MI  // CHF and possible MI      CHF and possible MI
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again is substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The pulmonary vessels are engorged and
 indistinct, consistent with increasing pulmonary venous pressure. More
 coalescent area at the right base could reflect developing consolidation in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
