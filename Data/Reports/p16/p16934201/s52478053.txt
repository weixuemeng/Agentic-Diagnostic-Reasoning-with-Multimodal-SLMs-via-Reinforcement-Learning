                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  eval ET tube and lines
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is interval development of increased density in the lower right chest
 most consistent in appearance with pleural fluid.  Underlying consolidation in
 the right lung base cannot be excluded.  In addition, there is increased
 density in the retrocardiac area consistent with atelectasis or consolidation.
 The cardiac silhouette is quite prominent, as before.  The aorta is tortuous
 and calcified.  Mediastinal structures are unchanged.  A transvenous pacemaker
 remains in place.  A right internal jugular introducer is now in place.  An
 endotracheal tube is been inserted and ends at the thoracic inlet.  Multiple
 surgical clips are projected beneath the diaphragm.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased density in the lower right chest consistent with pleural fluid. 
 There is increased density in the retrocardiac area consistent with
 atelectasis or consolidation.
