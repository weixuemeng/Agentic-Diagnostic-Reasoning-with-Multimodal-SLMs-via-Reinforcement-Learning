                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CAD, HFrEF (___%), DVTs, Afib, tachybrady s/p
 PPM, here with GIB c/b cardiac arrest with trop leak to 1.___, as well as
 hypoxia/SOB, treated for presumed PNA  // please evaluate extent of
 opacification on pa/lat
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ 11:46
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a left-sided single lead pacemaker, with lead tip over right
 ventricle.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly and prominence of the pulmonary hila, similar to
 the prior film.  There is upper zone redistribution with mild fluid overload
 similar to prior.  The aortic knob measures 4.7 cm.
 
 There is patchy opacity at the right lung at there is patchy bibasilar
 opacity, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation.  Small effusions are
 likely present.  Extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film.
 
 There is degenerative change in both shoulders including evidence right
 chronic left rotator cuff tear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiomegaly and mild vascular plethora, unchanged.
 2. Probable mild dilatation of the aorta, not significantly changed.
 3. Prominent tapered pulmonary arteries raise the question of pulmonary
 hypertension.
 4. Bibasilar opacities, similar to prior.  Probable small effusions.
 5. Chronic left rotator cuff tear.
