  1.  OG tube traverses below the diaphragm, with the tip likely in the body of
  the stomach.  2.  Lower lung volumes accentuate the perihilar vascular
  markings, however there appears to be mild pulmonary vascular congestion,
  increased compared to the prior exam.  3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
  with adjacent compressive atelectasis is persistent.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Biliary sepsis, intubation and nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.6 cm above the carina.
 The patient has also received a nasogastric tube.  The tip projects over the
 middle parts of the stomach.  The position of the right internal jugular vein
 catheter is unchanged.
 
 Lung volumes have decreased.  Minimal atelectasis at both lung bases. 
 Retrocardiac atelectasis.  Mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. 
 Minimal bilateral parenchymal apical scarring is unchanged and symmetrical.
