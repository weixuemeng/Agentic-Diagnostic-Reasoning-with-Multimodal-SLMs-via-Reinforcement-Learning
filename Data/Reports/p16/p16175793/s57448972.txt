                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with NSCLC w/ bone mets on chemo  // Eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There may be pleural thickening at
 the medial right upper lung, correlate with prior chest CT imaging.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal
 to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Multi-level degenerative changes
 and diffuse osteopenia along the spine.  There may be moderate compression of
 a mid thoracic vertebral body, not well assessed on this study.  Patient has
 reported bone metastases, better assessed on cross-sectional imaging.
