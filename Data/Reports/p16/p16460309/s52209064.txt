                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dehydration, rule out infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 Evaluation limited given the low lung volumes.  Surgical clips noted in the
 left upper quadrant.  There is a pleural-based opacity in the right mid lung
 with a convex contour which could represent a pleural-based nodule or
 loculated fluid.  There is a vague opacity in the left upper lung on the
 frontal view, which is new from prior exam and is of unclear etiology.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is evident.  The heart is top normal in size,
 with curvilinear calcification projecting over the left heart, likely
 representing calcified mitral annulus.  There is densely calcified aortic
 arch.  The mediastinal widening evident on today's exam, new from prior, could
 reflect technique.  Degenerative changes at the right shoulder are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple findings, new from prior including pleural-based opacity
 in the right mid lung, subtle opacity in the left upper lobe, and prominence
 of the mediastinum which can be further assessed on CT of the chest.  Also
 noted is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and calcified mitral annulus.
