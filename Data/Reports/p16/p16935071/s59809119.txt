                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with pneumomediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT chest from the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate well-expanded and
 clear lungs.  Heart is normal in size, and mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Known
 pneumomediastinum is much better appreciated on the chest CT from earlier
 today.  The upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pneumomediastinum is better appreciated on the CT and is very
 subtle on the radiograph.
