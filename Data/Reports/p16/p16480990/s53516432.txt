                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic breast cancer.  Evaluate for worsening opacities or new
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___, as
 well as CTA chest from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right chest port with the
 tip in right atrium.  Lung volumes are persistently low, and there is
 redemonstration of diffuse bilateral opacities, which are increased in the
 right upper lobe.  The remainder of the exam is unchanged, including at least
 2 wedge compression fractures, heterogeneous bone density secondary to known
 metastatic disease, and right scapular and left humeral head fractures, which
 are unchanged and likely pathologic.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased right upper lobe opacities may be due to atypical infection likely
 not covered by current antibiotics.
 
 These findings were discussed via telephone by ___, MD,  with ___
 ___, NP, at ___ on ___.
