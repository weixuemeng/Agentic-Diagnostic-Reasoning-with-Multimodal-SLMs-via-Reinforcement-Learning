                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, history of cancer.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison made with chest radiographs from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are very low with associated bronchovascular
 crowding.  Right port-a-cath terminates in the right atrium.  Bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Moderate
 thoracic kyphosis and a significantly deformed sternum are noted.  Diffuse
 sclerotic osseous metastatic disease is seen.  A left humerus fracture is
 poorly visualized. Sternal fracture/deformity is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bibasilar opacities, likely reflecting atelectasis.
 
 2.  Poorly visualized left humerus fracture.
 
 3.  Diffuse sclerotic osseous metastatic disease.
