                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC line has
 been pulled back.  The tip of the line nevertheless still projects over the
 right atrium.  To ensure position in the mid SVC, the line needs to be pulled
 back by another 6-7 cm.
 
 No other change, no evidence of complications, in particular no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
