                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of the patient with chemotherapy with history of
 metastatic pancreatic cancer with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hypoinflated and slightly limit evaluation.  However,
 the lungs are without a focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  A small
 bilateral pleural effusions are present. Minimal bibasilar atelectasiis noted.
 Right-sided PICC line is visualized with the catheter tip in the right atrium
 and retraction by at least 4.5 cm is recommended.  No free air is noted under
 the hemidiaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions. 2. 
 No focal infiltrate identified. However, if clinical suspicion for an atypical
 infection is high, then a dedicated chest CT without contrast is recommended
 study of choice.
 2.  Right-sided PICC line with catheter tip in the right atrium.  Clinical
 correlation regarding retraction by 4.5 cm is requested.
