                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with palpitations and chest pressure/pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ at 20:28, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are similar.  Lungs remain hyperinflated.  No pulmonary vascular
 congestion is demonstrated.  Rounded opacity projecting over the posterior
 aspect of the right diaphragm is compatible with a Bochdalek's hernia.  There
 is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Subsegmental
 atelectasis is noted in the lung bases.  Please note that the previously
 described small airways disease seen on CT is not well assessed on the current
 radiograph.  Ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament with vertebral
 body fusion is seen in the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Please note that the small airways
 disease seen on recent CT is not well assessed on the current radiograph.
