                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again
 hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms consistent
 with chronic pulmonary disease.  Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of
 normal or mildly enlarged given the hyperinflation.  There is again some
 tortuosity of the aorta.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular
 congestion or pleural effusion.
