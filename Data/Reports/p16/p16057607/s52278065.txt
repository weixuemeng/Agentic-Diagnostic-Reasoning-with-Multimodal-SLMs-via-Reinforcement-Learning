                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left pneumothorax status post pigtail
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:04
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube with the pigtail
 projecting over the medial aspect of the left upper lung field with
 essentially near complete resolution of the left pneumothorax on this supine
 exam, and re-expansion of the left lung. Streaky opacities within the left mid
 lung field may reflect areas of atelectasis.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are unchanged.  Mild emphysematous changes are noted in the right lung.
 Numerous fractures of the left fifth through tenth ribs are again noted, as
 seen previously, with associated subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest
 wall. Contrast from recent CT exam is seen within the collecting systems
 bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Near complete resolution of the left pneumothorax on this supine exam with
 re-expansion of the left lung status post left-sided chest tube placement.
