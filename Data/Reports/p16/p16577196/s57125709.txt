                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with productive cough with possible infiltrate
 and ? calcification overlying in the heart seen on prior chest xray // eval
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. Left lower lobe consolidation is large. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Approximately 4 cm curvilinear density in the anterior heart seen on the
 lateral view was seen previously and most likely represents dystrophic
 calcification in the left ventricle subsequent to myocardial infarction. The
 remainder of the curved opacity posterior to this curvilinear density is
 likely due to superimposition of multiple structures and is likely
 nonspecific.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed with ___ in Dr. ___
 office on the telephone on ___ at 2:49 PM.
