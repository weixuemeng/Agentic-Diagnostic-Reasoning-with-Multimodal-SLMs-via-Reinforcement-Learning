                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post lysis of adhesions, evaluate NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen pelvis ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  NG tube is present.  The side port
 ends at or just below the gastroesophageal junction.  The tube could safely be
 advanced 5-7 cm for positioning of the side port within the stomach.
 
 The lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal
 airspace consolidation.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar
 structures are unremarkable.  A small amount of free air is seen beneath the
 right hemidiaphragm, consistent with recent surgery.
