                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute abdomen, to assess for free air.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change and no
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  There is no evidence of free
 intraperitoneal gas.  However, this is probably not an upright image, so that
 pneumoperitoneum cannot be excluded.  If there is clinical suspicion for free
 air, CT would be the next imaging procedure.
