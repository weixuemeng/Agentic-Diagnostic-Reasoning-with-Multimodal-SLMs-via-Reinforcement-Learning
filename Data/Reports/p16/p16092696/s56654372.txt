 right upper quadrant pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate mildly low lung volumes
 which exaggerates the cardiac silhouette.  Allowing for this, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.  Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
