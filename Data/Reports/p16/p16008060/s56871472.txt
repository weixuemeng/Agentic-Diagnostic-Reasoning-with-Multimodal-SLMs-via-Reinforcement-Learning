                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:39 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Esophageal dilatation with EGD, question pneumomediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.  Mild reticulation at the
 base of the right lung suggests very minimal edema in the setting of
 emphysema.  Decreased caliber to the mediastinum and paratracheal soft
 tissues, probably due to decreased edema associated with the neoesophagus. 
 Heart size is normal.  There is no pulmonary consolidation or pleural
 effusion.
