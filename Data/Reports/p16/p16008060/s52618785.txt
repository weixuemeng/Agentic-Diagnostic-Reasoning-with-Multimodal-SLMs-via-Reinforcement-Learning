 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent MIE, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  No pneumothorax.  Large lung volumes, potentially caused by
 overinflation.  Known healed right rib fractures and increase in density of
 the right paramediastinal areas with obliteration of the paratracheal stripe.
 
 Improved ventilation of the left retrocardiac areas with resolution of a
 pre-existing atelectasis.  No newly occurred parenchymal opacities.
