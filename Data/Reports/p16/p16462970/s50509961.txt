                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Right posterior rib pain status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced
 fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  No displaced rib fracture seen. 
 However, please note that if clinical concern is high, dedicated rib series or
 CT is more sensitive.
