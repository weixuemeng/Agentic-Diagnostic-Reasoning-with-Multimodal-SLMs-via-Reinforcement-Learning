                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of CHF and COPD now with increased work of breathing, here
 to evaluate for interval changes. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___. 
 Otherwise, no prior studies are available for comparison.  
 
 Technique:  Portable semi-erect AP radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased from the most recent prior study. 
 There is increased streaky opacification of the right lung base and blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle reflecting a combination of small pleural
 effusion and increased atelectasis.  Retrocardiac opacification obscuring the
 left hemidiaphragm is unchanged compatible with small pleural effusion and
 underlying atelectasis or consolidation.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 and edema is slightly improved from the most recent prior study.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but
 stable.  The mediastinal contours are prominent but unchanged with tortuosity
 of the thoracic aorta and calcification of the aortic knob.  The trachea is
 deviated to the right by the aortic knob.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slightly improved interstitial edema from ___. 
 
 2.  Unchanged retrocardiac opacification reflecting small left pleural
 effusion and underlying atelectasis or consolidation. 
 
 3.  Increased right basilar atelectasis and unchanged small right pleural
 effusion.
