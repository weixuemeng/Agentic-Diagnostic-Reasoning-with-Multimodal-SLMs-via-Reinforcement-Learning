                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval esolution
 of previously seen right lung opacities.  There is retrocardiac opacity
 sihouetting the descending thoracic aorta.  Heart size is mildly enlarged. 
 Unfolding of the aorta is noted.  Cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise
 normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Chronic deformity of the left
 glenohumeral joint and proximal left humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe opacity compatible with pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting. Post treatment radiograph is recommended for
 documentation of resolution.
