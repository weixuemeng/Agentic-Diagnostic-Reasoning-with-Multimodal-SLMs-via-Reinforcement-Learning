                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   There is significant improvement
 in bilateral pleural effusions with only trace residual pleural effusions
 noted bilaterally associated with mild left basal atelectasis.  Tiny clips
 project over the lower thoracic midline.  Subtle nodularity in the right mid
 lung is noted which is of unclear etiology.  Difficult to exclude a subtle
 pneumonia though follow-up to resolution is advised.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tiny residual pleural effusions with mild residual left basal atelectasis. 
 Subtle nodularity in the right mid lung, newly conspicuous, question tiny
 focus of pneumonia.  Follow-up to resolution is recommended.
