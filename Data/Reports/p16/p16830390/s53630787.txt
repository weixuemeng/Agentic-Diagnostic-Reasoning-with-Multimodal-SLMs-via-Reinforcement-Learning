                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with metastatic breast cancer with CT chest ___
 with large effusion referred in, tachypneic, tachycardic to 130s  // eval ?
 evolving edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___ at 14:14
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears at least moderate to severely enlarged, as
 seen on the CT chest, due to the presence of loculated pericardial fluid. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged. Moderate size bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right are
 increased compared to the previous chest radiograph.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities appear to reflect compressive atelectasis.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, incompletely
 assessed, partly attributable to the presence of loculated pericardial fluid,
 as seen on the previous chest CT.  Moderate size bilateral pleural effusions,
 larger on right, with bibasilar compressive atelectasis.
