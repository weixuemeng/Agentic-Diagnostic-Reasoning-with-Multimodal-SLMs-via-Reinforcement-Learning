                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  A linear density
 in the right mid lung is most compatible with atelectasis or scarring. 
 Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  No consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema or pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable.  The imaged osseous structures are intact.  There is no free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm.
