                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a pacemaker defibrillator.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Lung volumes are low, probably because the examination was taken after
 expiration.  This exaggerates heart size which is probably top normal or
 minimally enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Lungs are
 grossly clear.  Transvenous right atrial pacer lead is in standard position. 
 The proximal electrode of the right ventricular defibrillator lead, which ends
 in the right ventricular apex, extends from the SVC into the upper right
 atrium.
