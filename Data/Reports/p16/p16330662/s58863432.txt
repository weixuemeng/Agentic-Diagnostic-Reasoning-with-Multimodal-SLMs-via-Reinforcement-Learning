 INDICATION:  Lung cancer with myocardial, brain mets with pericardial
 effusion, status post bronchoscopy and subxiphoid pericardial window performed
 ___, assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates unchanged examination
 with a stable moderate right apical pneumothorax.  The right-sided presumed
 pericardial catheter is unchanged in position.  The right-sided perihilar
 opacification is stable.  There is, however, slightly decreased opacification
 of the right lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimally changed examination with stable right moderate
 pneumothorax and decreased though persistent right lower lung opacification.
