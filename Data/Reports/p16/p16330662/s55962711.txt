                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post pericardial effusion drainage.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the most recent study from ___, a small to moderate
 right apical pneumothorax has not significantly changed in size. The
 right-sided chest presumed pericardial catheter is unchanged in position.
 Right-sided perihilar opacification is unchanged. There is minimal left lower
 lung atelectasis. There are no definite pleural effusions. No left-sided
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No significant change in size of small to moderate right apical
 pneumothorax.  The catheter projecting over the right hemithorax is presumably
 a pericardial drain and not a pleural catheter.
 
 2.  Unchanged right perihilar opacity.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 11:06
 via telephone on the day of the study, ___ min after discovery.
