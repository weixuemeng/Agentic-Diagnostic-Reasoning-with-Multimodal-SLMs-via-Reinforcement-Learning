                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of right-sided malignant effusion, now with chest tube
 removal.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Compared with the prior film, the pigtail catheter at the base of the right
 lung has been removed.  No conclusive pneumothorax is identified.  Again seen
 is relatively diffuse and hazy increased opacity through the right lung, with
 a more focal area of increased opacity in the right mid and upper zone
 laterally extending from the perihilar region.  This is essentially unchanged
 compared with the film from ___ at 7:26 a.m.  Allowing for technical
 differences, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged.  The
 large left hilum again noted.  Patchy opacity at the left base medially and
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle are similar to prior.  Within the
 remainder of the left lung, no CHF or focal infiltrate is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of pigtail catheter at right lung base. NO
 obvious ptx.  I doubt significant interval change. Hazy opacity in right lung
 persists.
