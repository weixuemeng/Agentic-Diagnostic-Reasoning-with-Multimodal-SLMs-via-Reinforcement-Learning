                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with dyspnea and recent diagnosis of lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, chest CT ___, PET-CT
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is hazy density overlying the right upper and mid lung
 fields, consistent with right upper lobe collapse, with better aeration at the
 right lung base.  The right hemidiaphragm is newly elevated compared to the
 prior chest radiograph, indicative of increased volume loss.  The left lung is
 essentially clear.  There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable. The upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: New right upper lobe collapse. Known pulmonary lesion is better
 assessed on recent cross-sectional imaging.
