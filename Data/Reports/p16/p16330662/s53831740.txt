                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with leukocytosis and cough.  Not hypoxic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Mild volume loss is present in the right upper hemithorax, where a large mass
 is contiguous with the upper pole of the right hilus and the adjacent
 mediastinum. Peripheral to the mass is extensive linear infiltration of the
 right upper lobe pulmonary interstitium.  The upper pole of the right hilus is
 enlarged and there is additional mediastinal contour in the aortopulmonic
 window.  All these findings suggest an extensive right upper lung malignancy
 with local lymphangitic extension and central adenopathy, on both sides of the
 midline.  There is no pleural effusion.  Left lung is grossly clear.  Heart is
 mildly enlarged, with a configuration favoring left atrial and left
 ventricular dilatation.  Physician covering Dr. ___ was paged at
 1:45 p.m.  If contact is not successful, the findings will be posted to the
 online record of critical radiology findings for direct notification of the
 responsible physician.
