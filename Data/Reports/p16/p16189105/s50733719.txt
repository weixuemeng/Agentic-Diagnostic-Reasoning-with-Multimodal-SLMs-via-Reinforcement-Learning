                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with postpartum cardiomyopathy.  Evaluate for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  The pulmonary vasculature is indistinct, compatible with
 mild edema, which was more conspicuous on ___ CT.  Blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle and indistinctness of the left costophrenic angle
 are compatible with small bilateral pleural effusions.  No focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema, which was more conspicuous on ___ CT, with small persistent bilateral pleural effusions.
