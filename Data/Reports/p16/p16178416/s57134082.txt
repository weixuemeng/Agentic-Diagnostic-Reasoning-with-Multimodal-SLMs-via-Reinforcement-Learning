                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with COPD, CHF presents with atrial fibrillation
 with rapid ventricular rate in PCP ___  // ?volume overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube is in standard position, terminating approximately 5.4 cm
 from the carina. Lung volumes are low. Moderate to severe enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is demonstrated. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated with vascular
 indistinctness and cephalization of vasculature.  Retrocardiac opacity may
 reflect atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present
 however the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. 
 Multilevel moderate degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine. There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.
 Followup radiographs after diuresis are recommended.
