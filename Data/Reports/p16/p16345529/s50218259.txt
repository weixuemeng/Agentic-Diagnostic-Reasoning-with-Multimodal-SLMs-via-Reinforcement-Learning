 coughing, sweats
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are extremely low lung volumes
 with striking elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour related to a
 large hiatal hernia.  There is suggestion of mild indistinctness of pulmonary
 vessels, though this could be a manifestation of the lung volumes rather than
 vascular congestion.
 If the condition of the patient permits, a lateral view could be helpful to
 evaluate the retrocardiac area as well as the area behind the hiatal hernia.
