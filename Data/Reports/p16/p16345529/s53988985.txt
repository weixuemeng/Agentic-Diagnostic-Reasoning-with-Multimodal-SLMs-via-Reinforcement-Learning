 When compared to prior, there has been no significant interval change.  Large

 left upper lung and right lung are clear without focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  There is no obvious pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette is
 difficult to assess given hiatal hernia.  Deformities of the right lateral
 ribs were present on prior exam and likely due to old fractures.
