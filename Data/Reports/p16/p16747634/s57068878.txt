                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, coarse breath sounds // Pneumonia or
 other intrathoracic process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with resultant vascular crowding. There is no evidence of
 pneumonia or frank pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar
 contours, and pleural surfaces are normal. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Appearance of the aortic arch is typical for an aberrant right
 subclavian artery. Cervical spinal fusion hardware is partially seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly low lung volumes but no evidence of pneumonia.
 Appearance of aortic arch may reflect aberrant right subclavian artery.
