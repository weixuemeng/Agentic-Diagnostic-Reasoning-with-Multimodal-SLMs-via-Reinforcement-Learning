  Bronchiectasis and mild emphysema at the lung bases seen on the study of ___ (CTA abdomen) is redemonstrated. Lung volumes are low. There is no
  evidence of new focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia. The heart is not
  enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no large pleural
  effusion or pneumothorax. Skin folds project over the right mid and left mid
  lungs. There is no pulmonary edema.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p whipple  // PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower today than they were on ___, causing crowding of
 pulmonary vessels. Upper lungs are entirely clear and there is no pulmonary
 edema. Pleural effusions are small if any in there is no pneumothorax. Normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is a suggestion of pneumoperitoneum,
 presumably related to recent surgery.
