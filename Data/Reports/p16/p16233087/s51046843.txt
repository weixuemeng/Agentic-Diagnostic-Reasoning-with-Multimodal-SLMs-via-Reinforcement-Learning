                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p MVR s/p CT removal  // eval for pneumo
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 06:42
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, the ET tube and NG tube have been removed.  The
 left chest tube has also been removed.  Additional linear densities are seen
 over the upper abdomen, but the mediastinal drain and right chest tube may
 very well have been removed.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is again seen.  The tip as been retracted and
 now overlies the proximal right main pulmonary artery.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy, with cardiomegaly, which appears
 unchanged.  The possibility of pericardial fluid cannot be excluded.
 
 There is persistent increased retrocardiac density with obscuration left
 hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. 
 There is also persistent hazy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region.  No
 right side no significant right-sided pleural effusion.  The possibility of a
 small left effusion cannot be excluded.  Minimal upper zone redistribution,
 but no overt CHF.
 
 Note is  again made of a normal variant azygos fissure .
 
 Much of the detail visible on the ___ chest CT is not apparent
 radiographically.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged.
 2. No pneumothorax detected.  No gross effusion.  A small left effusion would
 be difficult to exclude.
 3. Persistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Persistent
 patchy right cardiophrenic opacity.
 4. No overt CHF.
 5. No pneumothorax detected status post removal of chest tube.
