                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with PMH sCHF, atrial fibrillation, presented with
 dyspnea.  // please eval for vascular congestion, edema, or other abnormality
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Streaky left retrocardiac airspace opacities are noted.  There is blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle, which likely represents a combination of
 atelectasis and trace pleural effusion.  Allowing for AP projection, the heart
 may be mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly, probable trace left pleural effusion, and left retrocardiac
 airspace opacities which may reflect atelectasis although superimposed
 infection is not excluded.  Additional considerations include asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.
