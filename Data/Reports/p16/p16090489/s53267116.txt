                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with known left parapneumonic effusion, in
 acute resp distress. Evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from 2 days prior
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As seen on the prior CT, there is slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
 with peripheral subpleural consolidation, which obscures the costophrenic
 angle on the current radiograph. There is likely small amount of fluid
 adjacent to this as well. The lungs again demonstrate diffuse interstitial
 opacities in keeping underlying fibrosis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Extensive left along peripheral basilar consolidation, similar in extent
 to the CT from 2 days prior.  Etiologies include infectious or inflammatory
 process.
 2.  New small to moderate left pleural effusion.
