 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with h/o asthma, sarcoidosis, LUL lung
 resection and recurrent pneumonias who presented with pleuritic chest pain,
 fevers, and CXR and CT findings concerning for pneumonia.  // Please assess
 for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP radiograph of the chest was acquired.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___. Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A peripheral opacity along the lower left lung has not significantly changed
 allowing for lower lung volumes on today's examination.  There is an adjacent
 small left pleural effusion. The right lung is grossly clear. There is no
 right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Little interval change in left lower lung peripheral opacity allowing for
 decreased lung volumes. Radiographic follow-up to resolution is recommended.
 2. Small left pleural effusion.
