 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4 cm from the carina.  An
 orogastric tube tip terminates below the gastroesophageal junction however the
 side port is within the distal esophagus.  Dual-lumen left subclavian central
 venous catheter tip terminates in the right atrium.  The heart size is normal.
 The aortic knob is calcified.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Minimal
 atelectasis is demonstrated in the left lung base.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 are seen.
