                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Vomiting and low-grade fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  Minimal opacity at each lung base is suggestive of
 atelectasis but improved.  The lateral view in particular depicts a patchy
 posterior right basilar opacity, probably improved since the prior
 radiographs.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no free
 air.  Degenerative changes are moderately severe at each shoulder, but
 incompletely imaged or characterized.  The patient is status post lower
 anterior cervical fusion, also not entirely characterized.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased opacities at both lung bases.
