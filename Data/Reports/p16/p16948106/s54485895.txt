 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates an area of
 increased opacification in the right mid lung, which likely represents a right
 lower lobe consolidation representing either atelectasis or pneumonia.  There
 are small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. There is no
 pneumothorax. A right-sided PICC line ends in the mid SVC.  Nasogastric tube
 courses into the stomach out of the field-of-view. The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  Severe degenerative changes are seen in both
 shoulder joints and intact cervical plate is present
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is an area of increased opacification in the right mid lung, which
