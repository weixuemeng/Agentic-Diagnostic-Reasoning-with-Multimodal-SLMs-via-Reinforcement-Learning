 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  There are
 low lung volumes.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no pneumothorax
 or large pleural effusion.  Large opacity in the right lower lobe is most
 likely atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded.
