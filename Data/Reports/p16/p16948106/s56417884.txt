                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pseudomonal pna, intubated  // ? vol
 status
 
 COMPARISON:   Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:42
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube, NG tube, and right-sided PICC line are similar in position. Fixation
 hardware in the lower cervical spine is noted, not fully evaluated.
 
 Allowing for low inspiratory volumes and lordotic positioning, the overall
 appearance is similar. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged.
 There is CHF, with vascular plethora and blurring. There is increased
 retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and or
 consolidation. A small left effusion cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
