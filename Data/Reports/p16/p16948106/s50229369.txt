                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post ___'s in ___, s/p ex-lap, LOA ___ for SBO and
 again on ___ for unresolved SBO.  Question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 5:58 a.m. and allowing for technical differences, 
 the ET tube is no longer visualized.  NG tube overlies the upper stomach.  A
 right-sided PICC line tip overlies the distal SVC.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Diffuse opacities in both lungs
 and increased retrocardiac density, with partial obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm, are overall similar to prior film.
