 could also be pneumonia, particularly since it is accompanied by a small left
 pleural effusion. Conventional radiographs would be helpful, if feasible.
 Heart is top-normal size unchanged since ___. Right lung is clear. An upper
 enteric drainage tube passes into the nondistended stomach. No pneumothorax.
