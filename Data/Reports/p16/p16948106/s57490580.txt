                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of small-bowel obstruction, tachypnea.  Please evaluate
 for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an enteric tube which extends below the diaphragm with the
 tip in the body of the stomach.  There is a left-sided PIC line which
 terminates in the right atrium.  The lung volumes are low exaggerating the
 cardiomediastinal contours; however, mild cardiomegaly has been stable
 compared to exams dated back to ___.  There is mild perihilar vascular
 congestion with overall unchanged mild pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are persistent.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis,
 increased compared to the prior exam.  Dilated loops of bowel within the
 abdomen are consistent with patient's known small bowel obstruction.
 
 Deformity of the left humeral head is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema, overall unchanged compared to the prior exam.
 
 2.  Interval increase in mild bibasilar atelectasis.
