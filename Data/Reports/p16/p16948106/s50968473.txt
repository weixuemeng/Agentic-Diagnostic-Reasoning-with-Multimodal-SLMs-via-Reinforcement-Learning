                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube has been placed and it terminates in the
 stomach.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Patchy
 opacities are probably similar, allowing for small differences in technique,
 suggesting atelectasis.  No free air is identified.  Dilatation of bowel in
 the upper abdomen is better described in a separate abdominal report of the
 same day.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube terminating in the stomach.
