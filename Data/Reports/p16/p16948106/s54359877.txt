                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of respiratory distress, intubated.  Please evaluate ET
 tube location.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-erect portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube terminates approximately 3.8 cm above the carina.  Overall,
 there has been no significant interval change in the mild-to-moderate
 bilateral pulmonary edema.  There has been a slight interval increase in the
 small left pleural effusion, with a persistent small right pleural effusion.
 Prominence of the cardiomediastinal contours are likely secondary to low lung
 volumes, however, mild cardiomegaly has been persistent compared to exams
 dated back to ___.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.  Visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable. Right sided PIC line terminates in the
 mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. ET tube terminates approximately 3.8 cm above the carina. 
 
 2. No significant interval change in the extent of the moderate pulmonary
 edema.
 
 3. Slight interval increase in a small left pleural effusion.
