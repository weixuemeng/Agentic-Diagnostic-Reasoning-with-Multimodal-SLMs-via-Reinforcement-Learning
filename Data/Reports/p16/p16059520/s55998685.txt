                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Septic shock in the setting of obstructing right nephrolithiasis. 
 Evaluate endotracheal tube placement and pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 1:08 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest shows interval intubation with the
 endotracheal tube tip approximately 4 cm from the carina.  The right internal
 jugular catheter tip projects at the low SVC.  The enteric tube is
 appropriately positioned.  Lung volumes have improved since the prior study
 with pulmonary vascular prominence and evidence of mild congestive heart
 failure.  Otherwise, the cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory positioning of endotracheal tube with evidence of
 mild congestive heart failure.
