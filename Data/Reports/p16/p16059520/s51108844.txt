                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Urosepsis with central line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a new right internal
 jugular central venous line with the tip of the catheter 5.5 cm inferior to
 the carina. FOr more optimal positioning, it should be retracted by roughly
 15mm.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Otherwise, the lung volumes are reduced,
 accentuating the pulmonary vasculature and cardiac contour.  No good evidence
 for pulmonary edema or effusions.  Bibasilar atelectasis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Right internal jugular catheter tip terminates in the high right atrium
 and should be retracted by 15mm for more optimal positioning.
