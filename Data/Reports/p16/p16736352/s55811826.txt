                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal supine image of the chest was obtained.  The
 patient is extremely rotated, limiting evaluation.  There is no definite
 consolidation or pulmonary edema.  There are probable small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Within the limitations of the supine technique, there is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The trachea is diffusely calcified.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is not well evaluated due to rotation, although
 no gross abnormalities are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extremely limited evaluation due to technique and patient
 positioning.  There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions.  No
 evidence of pneumonia.
