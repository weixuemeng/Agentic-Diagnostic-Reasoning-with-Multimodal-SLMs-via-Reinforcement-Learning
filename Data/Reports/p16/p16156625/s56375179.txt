  The heart is markedly enlarged, slightly increased relative to prior
  examination dated ___.  Slight elevation of the left mainstem
  bronchus suggest left atrial enlargement.  Lungs are hyperinflated with
  flattening of the diaphragms suggestive of emphysematous changes.  There is no
  evidence of pulmonary edema.  There is no large pleural effusion.  There is no
  pneumothorax.  No focal opacity is identified convincing for pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dCHF and volume overloaded, HTN, HLD, DM 
 // signs of volume overload, pulm edema, pleural effusions      signs of
 volume overload, pulm edema, pleural effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there may be even further enlargement
 of the huge cardiac silhouette.  Again there is elevation of the main bronchus
 raising the possibility of left atrial enlargement.  Nevertheless, in the
 absence of pulmonary vascular congestion, the possibility of cardiomyopathy or
 even pericardial effusion should be seriously considered.
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or large pleural effusion.
