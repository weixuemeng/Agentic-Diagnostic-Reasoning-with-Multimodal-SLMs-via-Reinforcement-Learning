                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:50 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old woman after cardiac catheterization and pulmonary
 artery rupture with hemoptysis.  Assess hemorrhage, edema or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable.  It obscures much of
 the lower lungs, but there is no clear evidence of substantial pulmonary
 hemorrhage, and no pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  How much of the size of the
 severely enlarged cardiac silhouette is due to cardiomegaly and how much to a
 pericardial effusion is radiographically indeterminate.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
