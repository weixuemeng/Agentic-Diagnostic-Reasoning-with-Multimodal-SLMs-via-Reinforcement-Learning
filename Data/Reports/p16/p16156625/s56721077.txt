                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall on left side with bruising now mild sob 
 // eval pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  Limited reference is
 made to CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cortical irregularity and lucency through the lateral seventh left rib may
 reflect a nondisplaced fracture or chronic fracture as seen on the prior exam.
 No evidence of pneumothorax.  Overall appearance of the lungs is otherwise
 unchanged.  Slight increased opacity in the right mid thorax could reflect a
 nodular opacity demonstrated on cross-sectional CT from ___.  The
 heart is severely enlarged all including the right heart and left atrium, best
 appreciated on prior CT and may suggest cardiomyopathy.  Elevation of the left
 mainstem bronchus is overall unchanged, likely related to left heart
 enlargement.  The descending thoracic aorta is tortuous and/or ectatic,
 unchanged.  Scoliosis is also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left 7th rib deformity may be acute or chronic.  Correlate with focal
 tenderness and dedicated rib films could be obtained to further assess.
 2.  No pneumothorax.
 3.  Persistent severe cardiomegaly, concerning for cardiomyopathy.
 4.  Opacity in right mid hemithorax could correspond to opacity seen on CT
 from ___ and a dedicated chest CT could be performed to further evaluate, as
 previously recommended.
