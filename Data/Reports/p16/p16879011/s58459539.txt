                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and productive cough,
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Slight right
 infrahilar opacity on the frontal view is not confirmed on the lateral view
 and is felt to most likely be due to body habitus.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette
 is not enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
