                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with h/o known pulm nodule, pleural effusion who
 had CT placed ___ with moderate output  // evidence of pleural effusion
 reaccumulation, CT positioning     evidence of pleural effusion
 reaccumulation, CT positioning
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the outer aspect of the left
 hemithorax has been excluded from the image.  No pigtail catheter is seen at
 the left base, though it is unclear whether this could have merely been
 excluded from the image.  In any event, there is no evidence of left
 pneumothorax.
 A repeat study showing the outer most portion of the left lung should be
 obtained.
 Otherwise little change with evidence of intact sternal wires with previous
 CABG dense calcified granulomas in the right apical region.
