                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Large calcified granulomas in
 the right upper lobe as well as calcified lymph nodes within the mediastinum
 and hila bilaterally are compatible with prior granulomatous disease.  There
 is interval development of a small left pleural effusion with left basilar
 opacification.  Right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Multilevel degenerative changes are again
 seen within the imaged thoracic spine with several clips noted in the upper
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New small left pleural effusion and left basilar opacification, potentially
 reflective of atelectasis or infection.
