 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Atrial fibrillation, RVR, admitted for AMS, hypotension, C. diff
 colectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 2.3 cm above the carina.  Left jugular line is in upper SVC. 
 Feeding tube is below the diaphragm, the distal end not included in this
 study.  Bilateral moderate layering pleural effusion with bibasilar
 atelectasis is unchanged.  Minimal volume overload has slightly increased. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tube and lines are in adequate position.
 2.  Layering moderate pleural effusions are stable with bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  Minimal increase in very mild volume overload.
