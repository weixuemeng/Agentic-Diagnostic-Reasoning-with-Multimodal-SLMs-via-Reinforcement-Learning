                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cryoglobulinemia previously complicated by
 pulmonary hemorrhage, no symptoms currently  // any cpd
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain enlarged.  Prominence of the main
 pulmonary artery suggests pulmonary arterial hypertension.  There is a small
 to moderate right pleural effusion with some fluid seen tracking along the
 major fissure.  Right base opacity due to combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, but underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Central pulmonary
 vascular engorgement is seen.  Prominent calcified left lower lobe granuloma
 is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small 2 moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Right
 base opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis,
 however, underlying consolidation is not excluded.
 
 Persistent cardiomegaly.
 
 Persistent prominence of the main pulmonary artery may be due to pulmonary
 hypertension.
