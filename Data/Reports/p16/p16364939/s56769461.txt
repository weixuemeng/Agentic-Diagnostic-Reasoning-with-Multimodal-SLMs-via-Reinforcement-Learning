 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Ascites. Evaluate for pleural effusions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Calcifications in the aortic knob are
 once again re- demonstrated.  There is central pulmonary vascular predominance
 with cephalization with mild interstitial edema.  There are tiny bilateral
 pleural effusions. Previously seen increased opacities in the right base have
 improved. A calcified granuloma in the left lung is unchanged. There are
 subtle bibasilar densities which could represent atelectasis. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild
 bibasilar atelectasis.
