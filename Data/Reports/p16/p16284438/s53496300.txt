                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chest tube placed to water seal  // Please
 assess for pneumothorax      Please assess for pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at 17:18
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 10:12 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left chest tube remains in place.  The left apical pneumothorax is at
 least a stable, if not slightly smaller.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath is
 unchanged in position.  The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG
 and aortic valve replacement with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal
 contours.  The main pulmonary artery is prominent which may reflect underlying
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Lungs are hyperinflated with parenchymal
 scarring consistent with known underlying emphysema.  More rounded opacities
 at both lung bases likely correspond to known metastatic disease in this
 patient with rectal cancer.  There is patchy increasing opacity at the right
 costophrenic angle which could reflect an area of atelectasis, although
 aspiration or early pneumonia should be considered.  Blunting of both
 posterior costophrenic angles may reflect small effusions or pleural
 thickening.  No pulmonary edema.
