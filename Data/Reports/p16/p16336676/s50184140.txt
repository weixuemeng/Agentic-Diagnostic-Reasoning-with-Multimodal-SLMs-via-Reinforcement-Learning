                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough and fever  // evaluate for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable.  Multifocal, relatively diffuse ill-defined nodular opacities
 are noted in both lungs, predominantly in a perihilar and basilar
 distribution.  Small left pleural effusion is likely present.  The hila appear
 prominent bilaterally and underlying lymphadenopathy is suggested.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Ill-defined diffuse nodular opacities, most pronounced in the perihilar
 regions and lung bases bilaterally, concerning for multifocal pneumonia. 
 Small left pleural effusion.  Followup radiographs after treatment are
 recommended to ensure resolution of these findings.
