 earlier on the same day.  No focal consolidation or pleural effusion.  Stable
 appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila.  Stable bilateral
 lower lung volumes.

 1.  Newly placed right IJ catheter ends in the approximate region of the
 cavoatrial junction.
 
 2.  Mild interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion.  Otherwise, no
 significant interval change.
