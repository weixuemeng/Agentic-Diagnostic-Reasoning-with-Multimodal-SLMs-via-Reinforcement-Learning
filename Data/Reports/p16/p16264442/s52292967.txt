                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:05
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates at the junction
 of the SVC and right atrium. No pneumothorax is present. Moderate enlargement
 of the heart is again noted with coronary artery stenting. Atherosclerotic
 calcifications of the aortic knob are again present. Mediastinal contour is
 otherwise unchanged. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, perhaps
 minimally worse in the interval. Streaky opacities in the lung bases may
 reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip at the junction of the SVC
 and right atrium. No pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 bibasilar streaky opacities, likely atelectasis.
