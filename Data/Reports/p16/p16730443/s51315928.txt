                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with RUQ pain, WBC ___, ttp, equivocal US  // eval ? RLL pna,
 effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.  CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are relatively low.  Surgical chain sutures project over the
 right mid lung.  Nodular opacities project over the lungs bilaterally
 compatible with known metastatic disease although given differences in
 technique these have likely enlarged.  Ill-defined opacity also noted in the
 retrocardiac region with lack of clear delineation of the descending thoracic
 aorta, compatible with enlarged mass since prior.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.  No free intraperitoneal air.  Surgical clips project over at
 the lower neck.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent interval enlargement of the bilateral pulmonary nodules and
 retrocardiac mass compatible with patient's metastatic disease.
