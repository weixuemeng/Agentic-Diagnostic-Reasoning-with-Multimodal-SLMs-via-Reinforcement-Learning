                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with known thyroid CA, mets to lung presents with tachypnea,
 weakness  // Evaluate for PE, pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral pulmonary nodules are again compatible with patient's known
 metastatic disease.  There is a right-sided pleural effusion as seen on prior
 CT from ___ which may have slightly enlarged.  Adjacent right basilar
 opacity is also noted which could be due to atelectasis although superimposed
 infection would certainly be possible.  Appearance of the left lung has not
 changed noting the pulmonary nodules and retrocardiac mass.  Right hilar
 enlargement is better seen on prior CT.  Large hiatal hernia is again noted. 
 Surgical clips seen in the lower neck.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided pleural effusion, perhaps slightly larger from ___
 compared to prior chest CT.  Adjacent opacity could be secondary to
 atelectasis although superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Otherwise no
 change in the appearance of the bilateral pulmonary nodules and masses.
