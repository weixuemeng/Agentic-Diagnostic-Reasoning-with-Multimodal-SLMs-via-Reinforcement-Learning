 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic lung cancer  // eval for
 interval change/ptx?      eval for interval change/ptx?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is further increase in the
 degree of right pleural effusion in a patient with multiple nodular
 opacifications consistent with pulmonary metastases.  There is significant
 dilatation of the gas - stomach with gas filling the esophagus.  Nasogastric

 obstruction.
