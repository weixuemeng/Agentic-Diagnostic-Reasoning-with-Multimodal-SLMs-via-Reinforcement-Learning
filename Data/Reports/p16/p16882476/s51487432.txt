                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old man with coronary artery disease, cough and crackles.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Heart is normal size, pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable and there is no
 edema or pleural effusion.  Borderline hyperinflation raises the possibility
 of chronic obstructive lung disease.  There are no focal findings to suggest
 pneumonia.  Mild pleural thickening along the right lower lateral costal
 pleural surface is longstanding, of no active concern.  Thoracic aorta is
 heavily calcified but not aneurysmal or changed.
