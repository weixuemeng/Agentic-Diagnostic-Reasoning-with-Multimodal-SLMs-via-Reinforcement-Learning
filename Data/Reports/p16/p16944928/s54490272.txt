                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Blurry vision for 1.5 hours, suspected TIA.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged with mild enlargement of the right atrium as
 well as evidence of tortuous aorta.  Lung fields are clear.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Adjacent to the right heart border, there is a semi-oval opacity most likely
 representing part of the right atrium but given the slightly unusual contour,
 followup with a few shallow oblique views is recommended to exclude the
 possibility of other abnormality.
