                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory distress, evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors with direct comparison made to study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 3.7 cm above the carina in appropriate
 position. A right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
 
 There are unchanged bilateral, right greater than left pleural effusions as
 well as mild pulmonary edema. Volume loss in the left lung base could be due
 to atelectasis, and likely  accentuated by severe scoliosis and oblique
 positioning of the patient. The cardiac silhouette is unchanged. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent bilateral, right greater than left moderate pleural effusions
 as well as mild pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis with volume loss in the left lower lobe for further
 accentuated due to oblique patient positioning.
