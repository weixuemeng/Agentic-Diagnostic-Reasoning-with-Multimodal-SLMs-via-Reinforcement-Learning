                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Please note that the IMPRESSION of the report should read as
 follows:
 
 Slightly improved aeration of the right lung base with decreased right and
 stable left pleural effusions. Stable bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
 Pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bilateral chest tubes.  // Evaluate
 interval change in effusions, chest tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates at the level of clavicles. A right subclavian
 central venous catheter terminates in the upper SVC. Bibasilar pigtail
 catheters unchanged in position.  Moderate pleural effusions with associated
 bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis are not appreciably changed from the study
 of 1 day prior. Aeration at the right lung base is slightly improved.  Heart
 size is normal despite the projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly improved aeration at the right lung base with decreased right and
 stable left pleural effusions and bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.PNeumonia
 vs atelectl;extgasis radiogrphayically indeterminaete.
