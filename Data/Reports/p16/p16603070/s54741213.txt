                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with COP and NSIP recently biopsied.  On
 prednisone.  Evaluate for any improvement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___.
 
 There has been some improvement in the severity of peribronchial infiltration
 in some areas of the lung, particularly the right apex laterally and in both
 perihilar regions.  There are no new abnormalities.  Interstitial abnormality
 in the lower lung zones hard to assess, but certainly has not worsened.  Heart
 size normal.  No pleural effusion or evidence of central lymph node
 enlargement in most locations, although along the lateral view there is the
 possibility of adenopathy at the lower pole of one hilus.  Given recent chest
 CT scan that showed no adenopathy, I do not think this finding necessarily
 warrants further imaging.
