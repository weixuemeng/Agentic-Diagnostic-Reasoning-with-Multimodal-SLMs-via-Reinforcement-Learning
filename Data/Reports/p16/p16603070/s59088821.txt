                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a subtle field of radiodensity projecting over the right
 upper lobe between the anterior second and third ribs.  It is uncertain if
 this is sequela of previous radiation treatment, if any, or an acute
 pneumonia.  Remainder of the lungs are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  The pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe opacity which may represent sequela of radiation
 treatment or acute pneumonia.
