                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with continued cough, dyspnea and weakness after
 finishing Z-PAK for pneumonia.  Rule out infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to prior from
 ___.
 
 When compared to prior, again seen is a right upper lobe infiltrate which may
 have partially improved since prior.  There is, however, slightly more
 conspicuous opacity on the lateral view in the retrocardiac clear space and
 overlying the spine, potentially localizing to the left.  Elsewhere, the lungs
 are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous and soft
 tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Perhaps slightly improved opacity at the right lung apex
 suspicious for pneumonia.  Slightly more conspicuous opacity at the lung base
 likely on the left, potentially new infiltrate.  Continued followup is
 suggested to document resolution after treatment.
