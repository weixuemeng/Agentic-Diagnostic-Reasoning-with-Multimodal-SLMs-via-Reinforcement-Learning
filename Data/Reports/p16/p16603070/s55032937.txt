                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Interstitial lung disease.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change in
 the severe prominence of interstitial markings with areas of interspersed air
 bronchograms and traction bronchiectasis throughout both lungs.  Basal and
 peripheral location of the changes suggests the possibility of acute
 exacerbation of the fibrotic process.  Cardiac silhouette is essentially
 unchanged.
