                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. CT chest ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Ill-defined
 opacities are demonstrated within the right upper lobe, right lung base, and
 to a lesser extent the left lung base, similar in distribution when compared
 to the prior CT from ___.  No new areas of focal consolidation are
 demonstrated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple ill-defined areas of opacification within the right lung
 and left lung base.  Findings appear relatively similar when compared to the
 prior chest CT, with the findings in the right upper lobe likely reflecting
 resolving pneumonia, and findings elsewhere in the lungs suggestive of
 underlying chronic interstitial lung disease (such as cryptogenic organizing
 pneumonia or NSIP, as noted in the prior CT). No new areas of consolidation
 identified.
