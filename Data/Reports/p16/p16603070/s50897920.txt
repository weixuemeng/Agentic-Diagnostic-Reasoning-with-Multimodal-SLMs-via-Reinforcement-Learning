                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post BAL, new oxygen requirement, pleuritic chest pain.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 There is faint patchy opacity throughout much of the right lung and in the
 left mid lower zones.  The appearance is similar to ___ at 16:31 p.m. 
 There is relative sparing of the left upper zone.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax.  MInimal upper zone redistribution, but doubt overt CHF. Heart
 size is at the upper limits of normal.  The aorta is slightly unfolded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Minimal upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 2.  No pneumothorax detected.  
 
 3.  Abnormal opacities in both lungs, grossly consistent with findings on ___
 CT scan.  The differential diagnosis includes inflammatory or infectious
 etiologies.  An infiltrative process is considered less likely, but is not
 entirely excluded based on the imaging appearance.
