 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PD, and seizure presenting with AMS.  //
 Please assess for interval change in rt pleural consolidation/effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is stably enlarged.  Mild vascular congestion seen on
 most recent comparison has largely resolved.  There is improvement of right
 basilar opacity.  A nodular opacity in the left mid lung is more pronounced on
 the current examination than on the priors.  No definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Improved vascular congestion and right basilar opacity.
 2.  More prominent left mid lung nodular opacity.  Repeat films with all
 overlying external material removed is recommended.  If this abnormality
 persists, CT chest is recommended for further evaluation.
