                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with increased somnolence and ?belly pain  //
 infection?      infection?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the nasogastric tube extends at
 least to the mid body of the stomach where it crosses the lower margin of the
 image. There is sharp appearance of the hemidiaphragms and costophrenic
 angles. Although this could indicate improvement in the degree of pleural
 effusion, it may also be merely a manifestation of a more erect position of
 the patient.
 Cardiac silhouette remains prominent and there is some indistinctness of
 pulmonary vessels consistent with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
