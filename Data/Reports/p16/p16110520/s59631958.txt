                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiographs through ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 12 mm, nodular opacity in the medial aspect of right lower lung overlying the
 posterior end of 8th rib is concerning for lung nodule, however could be
 within the rib.  To differentiate between lung nodule vs rib lesion, I
 recommend shallow oblique views for further evaluation. Mild atelectasis is
 present in the left lung base.  Few tiny, well-defined, nodular opacities in
 the right upper lung are likely calcified granulomas.  There are no lung
 opacities concerning for pneumonia.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  12 mm nodular opacity in the right lower lung overlying posterior 8th rib.
 I recommend shallow oblique views for further evaluation and to
 differentiation between lung nodule vs rib lesion.
 
 2.  Multiple calcified granulomas in right upper lung.
