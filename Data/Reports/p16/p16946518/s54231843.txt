                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with intubation  // ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:   2 AP portable chest x-rays 1 labeled # 1 the other labeled # to
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 07:28
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 On chest x-ray # 1, an ET tube is present, tip lying in the proximal portion
 of the right mainstem bronchus.
 
 On chest x-ray # 2, the tip of the ET tube lies approximately 3.1 cm above the
 carina, in improved position.
 
 The previously seen NG tube is no longer visualized.  The stomach is distended
 with air.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is patchy opacity of both lung
 bases, those could represent atelectasis.  in the appropriate clinical
 setting, an infectious infiltrate or focus of aspiration could have a similar
 appearance.  Vertical linear opacity in the left suprahilar region most likely
 also represents atelectasis.
 
 Doubt CHF.  No gross effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of ET tube.  On view # 2, the ET tube is in satisfactory
 position approximately 3.1 cm above the carina.
 
 Patchy bibasilar atelectasis, slightly more pronounced than on ___. 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, the differential diagnosis could include
 an infectious infiltrate or areas of aspiration the pneumonitis.
 
 Interval removal of NG tube.  The stomach is quite distended by air on the
 current study.
