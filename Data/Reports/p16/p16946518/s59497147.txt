                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with UGIB  // eval for NGT location; aspiration
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An NG tube is present, tip lies over the right mid abdomen, possibly in the
 gastric antrum, though notably distal.  No free air seen beneath the
 diaphragms
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low, resulting in prominence of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and bronchovascular crowding.  There is upper zone redistribution,
 but doubt overt CHF.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite infiltrate.  No
 consolidation or effusion detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube tip overlying the right abdomen, possibly in the gastric antrum,
 though notably distal.
 
 Low inspiratory volumes with bibasilar atelectasis, but no definite infiltrate
 to suggest a focus of aspiration.
