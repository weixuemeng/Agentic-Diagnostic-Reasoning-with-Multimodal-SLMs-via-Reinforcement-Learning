                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with MVC  // eval for hemothorax, pneumothorax, rib
 fx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable frontal views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable views of the chest. No focal consolidation is seen. No large
 pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette
 is top-normal, likely exaggerated by AP technique. Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process. If high concern for rib fracture, dedicated
 rib series or CT is more sensitive.
