                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Question nodule versus shadow on prior chest x-ray in ___. 
 Evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  The previously reported
 possible lung nodule is not seen on these films.  However, there has been
 increase in heart size as well as increased distention of the azygous vein and
 cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature which suggests development of mild
 CHF.  There is no evidence of pneumonia.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  Opacity seen on prior study concerning for possible nodule is
 no longer seen today.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Previously reported opacity possibly representing a lung nodule is not seen
 on this study and most likely was a summation of shadows. 
 
 2. Likely interval development of mild CHF.
