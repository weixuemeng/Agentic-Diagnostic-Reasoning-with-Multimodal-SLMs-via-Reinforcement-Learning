 COMPARISON:   None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 4.6 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube courses below
 the diaphragm and out of view.  A poorly defined opacity in the right lung
 base medially may represent aspiration and/or pneumonia.  .  Left pleural
 effusion is small.  Cardiac silhouette is normal size.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A poorly defined opacity in the right lung base medially may represent
 aspiration and/or pneumonia.  Pulmonary malignancy is an additional
 consideration.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Followup chest radiograph is recommended to document
 resolution of the right lower lobe opacity to exclude the possibility of a
 nodule or mass in this region.
