                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Weight loss, persistent cough.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.  Cardiac size is top normal. 
 The aorta is tortuous as before.  Widened mediastinum is likely due to
 lymphadenopathy.  Increase in size in the right hilum is also likely due to
 lymphadenopathy.  There is a new mass in the right upper lobe measuring
 approximately 2.5 cm, spiculated, associated with new multiple bilateral lung
 nodules.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are probably tiny bilateral
 effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings are most likely due to lung malignancy with bilateral
 metastasis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Findings were discussed with Dr.
 ___ by phone on ___ at 3:30 p.m., 3 minutes after the discovery
 of the finding. CT is recomended
