                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with known head and neck cancer, now presenting
 with increased dyspnea and fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Linear opacities are identified along the
 right heart border and appear to project over the heart on the lateral
 projection, findings which could reflect a mild consolidation, either
 atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical circumstance.  No large
 pleural effusions are evident.  The patient has known pulmonary nodules due to
 head and neck cancer as seen on prior chest CT.  However, there appear to be
 new large nodules within the right lung, particularly in the right mid lung
 with a large nodule measuring 17 mm.  Findings are new compared to prior CT
 examination from ___ and are concerning for progressive metastatic
 disease.  Known nodules in the left upper lobe are not well characterized.  A
 confluent density in the left lung apex corresponds with a known neck mass in
 that region.  However, there appears to be increased mass effect upon the
 tracheal resulting in exaggerated rightward shift.  Cardiomediastinal
 structures appear within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Subtle opacity in the region of the right middle lobe, possible
 atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Increasing pulmonary nodules particularly within the right mid-lung,
 findings concerning for progressed metastatic disease.
 3.  Increased density of the left lung apex and worsening mass effect on the
 trachea, findings worrisome for enlargement of known neck mass.
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the above results to Dr. ___
 ___ at 11:17 p.m. on ___ by telephone.
