                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with seizures, evaluate for infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits.  The bilateral
 hila are unremarkable.  There may be minimal increased opacity at the right
 heart border/cardiophrenic angle, likely secondary to crowding of
 bronchovascular structures.  The lungs are otherwise clear without evidence of
 focal consolidation, nodule, or mass.  There is no evidence of pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
