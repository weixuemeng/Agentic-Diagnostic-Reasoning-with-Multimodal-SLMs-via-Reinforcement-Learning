                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of pleural effusion, pleurodesis, worsening
 of shortness of breath, recurrence?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right lower lung atelectasis has significantly improved.  Right heart border
 is still indistinct with an unusual configuration.  On the CT scan of ___, there was some loculated pleural effusion in this area. There is
 possibly residual loculation in this area on today's exam. The left lung is
 unremarkable.  The patient had prior sternotomy for an ascending aortic
 repair.  Tortuosity of the aorta is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 There is still an unusual contour of the right heart border which could
 reflect residual loculated pleural effusion given the presence of loculated
 fluid in this region on prior CT.
