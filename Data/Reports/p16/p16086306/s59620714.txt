                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pleural effusions, evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Status post sternotomy, cardiac enlargement,
 and general widened appearance of the thoracic aorta as before.  The
 previously described bilateral pleural effusions have again increased to a
 mild degree on the right but more significant on the left.  In the lateral
 location, a previous thoracocentesis accounted for the temporarily decreased
 pleural density.  When comparison is extended to the pre-thoracocentesis
 examination of ___, the amount of pleural effusion is seen to be
 unchanged.  No new pulmonary abnormalities are identified and no pneumothorax
 is seen.
