                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is increased opacification
 at the right base with meniscus formation.  This is consistent with
 reaccumulation of pleural fluid.  However, this is a difficult diagnosis
 because it could also reflect change in position with the upright patient,
 rather than the layering of fluid causing an indistinct opacification at the
 right base on the previous supine view.
 
 Left lung is unchanged.
