                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bilateral effusions, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the bilateral
 pleural effusion is unchanged.  No substantial increase or decrease.  No
 change in moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Status
 post cardiac surgery.  Secondary to the effusions, areas of atelectasis are
 seen at both lung bases.  In the normally ventilated lung areas, there is no
 evidence of pneumonia or other parenchymal change.
