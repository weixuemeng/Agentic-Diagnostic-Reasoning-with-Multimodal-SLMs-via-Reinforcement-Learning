                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with effusion, pleurodesis, chest tube placement. 
 Evaluation for effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Pleurodesis has been done with right chest tube projecting at the apex.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Increased density at right lung base could be due to
 reaccumulation of pleural fluid or increased atelectasis.  Subcutaneous air
 has decreased.  Minimal left lung base atelectasis has increased.  Patient had
 prior sternotomy for repair of ascending aorta aneurysm.  The aorta is still
 tortuous and moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Patient had recent pleurodesis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Increase in
 density at right lung base could be due to reaccumulation of pleural fluid or
 increase in atelectasis.
