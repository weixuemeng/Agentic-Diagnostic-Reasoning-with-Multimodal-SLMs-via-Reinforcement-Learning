                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate a dilated thoracic
 aorta and sternal wires and surgical clips projecting over the right
 mediastinum compatible with prior ascending aortic dissection repair.  The
 cardiac silhouette size is top normal.  Mediastinal contour is otherwise
 unchanged.  Somewhat rounded opacity projecting over the right lung base is
 likely related to prior talc pleurodesis, as seen on the previous examination.
 There is no new focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.  The visualized upper abdomen
 is unremarkable.  Moderate degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post ascending aortic dissection repair without evidence for acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
