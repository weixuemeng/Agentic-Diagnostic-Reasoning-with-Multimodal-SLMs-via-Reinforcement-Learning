                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with bilateral effusions, status post
 ascending aorta hemi-arch replacement with resuspension of his aortic valve on
 ___.  Status post left-sided thoracocentesis with ___ mL evacuated. 
 Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position and analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar study obtained two hours earlier.  During the latest
 examination interval, a left-sided thoracocentesis has been performed and the
 amount of left-sided pleural effusion has been reduced markedly resulting in
 visibility of the left-sided diaphragmatic contour with only minor blunting of
 lateral and posterior pleural sinus remaining.  No pneumothorax can be
 identified.  Lungs remain aerated as before, status post thoracotomy and
 general aortic contour dilatation as seen earlier.
