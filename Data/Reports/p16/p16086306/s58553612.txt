                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Recurrent right effusion post-pleurodesis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Tortuous and ectatic aorta is again
 visualized.  Small right effusion has decreased.  Right lower lobe opacities
 have decreased, consistent with decreasing atelectasis.  Small left effusion
 is unchanged.  Left lower lobe atelectases have improved.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Sternal wires are aligned.  Moderate-to-severe degenerative
 changes are again noted in the thoracic spine.
