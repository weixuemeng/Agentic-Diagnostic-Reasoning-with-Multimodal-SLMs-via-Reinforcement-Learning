 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pleural effusions have
 minimally decreased in extent.  They, however, remain clearly visible.  At
 both lung bases, right more than left, areas of atelectasis are seen. 
 Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Unchanged surgical material in the
 sternum and at the level of the right hilus.  The ventilated parts of the lung
 parenchyma appear normal.
