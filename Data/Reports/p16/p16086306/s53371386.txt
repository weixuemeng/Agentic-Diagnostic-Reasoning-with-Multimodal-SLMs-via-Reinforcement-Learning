                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with ascending aortic repair.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-___ ___, CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Worsening right basilar atelectasis, new right and persistent small
 left pleural effusions are present. Minimal left basilar opacity is unchanged.
 The lungs are otherwise clear.  The pulmonary vasculature remains normal.  The
 cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged, the mediastinal contours are widened.
 Median sternotomy wires remain intact.
 
 A right IJ sheath, endotracheal tube, and NG tube have been removed in the
 interim.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions, right greater than
 left.  Marked mediastinal contour abnormality is unchanged and is consistent
 with patient's history of aortic repair.
