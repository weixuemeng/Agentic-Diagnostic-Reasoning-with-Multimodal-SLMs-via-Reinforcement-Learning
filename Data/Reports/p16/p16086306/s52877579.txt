                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent pleural effusion.  Status post right thoracoscopy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP erect view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Small right pleural effusion has nearly resolved since interval placment of
 apical chest tube, responsible for extensive new subcutaneous emphysema in the
 right chest wall, but there is no pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion is
 larger. Moderate cardiomegaly and large, tortuous thoracic aorta are chronic
 and unchanged. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are unchanged in
 appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval near resolution of right pleural effusion with placement of a
 right apical chest tube; no pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema can be attributed to thoracostomy but
 should be monitored, since persistence could reflect a bronchopleural leak.
 
 3.  Stable, chronic moderate cardiomegaly and very abnormal aorta.
 
 4.  New small left pleural effusion.
