                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with recurrent right pleural effusion,
 status post thoracocentesis/pleurodesis, assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Status post sternotomy and previous bypass
 surgery with multiple surgical clips in the anterior mediastinum appear
 unchanged.  Moderate cardiac enlargement as before and unchanged appearance of
 the markedly dilated thoracic aorta unchanged.  No evidence of increased
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  The previously described right-sided pleural
 densities consistent of blunting of the lateral pleural sinus and mild
 thickening of the pleural space along the lateral view including some
 accentuated visibility of the minor fissure appear all unchanged.  As the
 appearance of both posterior pleural sinuses as identified on the lateral view
 is free, it is unlikely,that there is a major amount of free pleural effusion
 present.  No pneumothorax is present in the apical area on the frontal view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings in patient with ectatic thoracic aorta,
 status post bypass surgery and bilateral pleural scar formations, more on the
 right than left.  There is no conclusive evidence for free pleural effusion.
