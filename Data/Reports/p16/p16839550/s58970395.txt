                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and left lower extremity weakness after a
 fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided
 dual-chamber pacemaker device is re- demonstrated with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is similar when
 compared to the prior study.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, not
 substantially changed from prior.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are re-
 demonstrated, though the previously seen fluid tracking in the right minor
 fissure is less evident on the current exam.  Bibasilar airspace opacities are
 present, and may reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild congestive heart failure, not significantly changed in the interval with
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar patchy airspace opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be completely excluded.
