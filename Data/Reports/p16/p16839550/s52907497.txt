 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ CT.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  An AICD again
 seen projecting over the left chest wall with lead tips in the expected
 location of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Midline sternotomy wires
 and mediastinal clips are again noted.  When compared with a prior CT chest
 ___ ___ and multiple prior chest radiographs, the pattern of pleural
 thickening at the lung bases is unchanged accounting for the blunted CP angle.
 Overall, there is no significant change in the appearance of the lower lungs
 compared with prior CT and chest radiographs from ___.  No definite
 sign of pneumonia or CHF.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony
 structures are intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable exam from multiple prior studies with stable pleural
 thickening in the lower lungs, accounting for the vague hazy opacities.  No
 acute intrathoracic process.
