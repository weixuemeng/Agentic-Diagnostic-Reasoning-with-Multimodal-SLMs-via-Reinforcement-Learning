                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and with recent hospital admission for small bowel
 obstruction, rule out pneumonia or heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but
 unchanged from prior.  Bilateral pleural effusions have increased and fluid is
 seen tracking into the minor fissure.  Compared to prior there is a new right
 lower lung opacity that is likely ateletasis but pneumonia should not be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is some prominence of the
 interstitial vasculature.  No pneumothorax or focal consolidation is seen.  A
 left-sided pacemaker is present with wires terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  Midline sternotomy wires and CABG clips are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild vascular congestion, unchanged from prior.  Opacity within
 the right lower lung is likely atelectasis but pneumonia could be considered
 in the correct clinical setting.
