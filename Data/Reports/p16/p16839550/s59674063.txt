                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were compared to previous
 exam from ___.  When compared to prior, there has been no
 significant interval change.  Again seen is a right lung base opacity
 localizing to the lower lobe on the lateral exam.  Elsewhere, the lungs remain
 clear.  Pleural thickening versus prominent extrapleural fat seen laterally on
 the right as well as regions of calcified pleura.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.  Dual-lead pacing device
 again noted as well as postoperative changes from median sternotomy.  Osseous
 and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right basilar opacity, for which clinical correlation
 is recommended regarding possibility of infection versus atelectasis.
