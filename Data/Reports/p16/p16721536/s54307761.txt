 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Lung volumes are lower which may account for an apparent increase in the
 already large cardiac silhouette both before and after surgery. Man may also
 explain possible increase in the moderate left pleural effusion adjacent to
 the persistently collapsed left lower lobe. Vascular crowding is more
 pronounced in the left lung. It is relatively unremarkable on the right.
 Subsegmental atelectasis at the right lung base is more pronounced. There is
 no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Right jugular line ends in the upper SVC.
