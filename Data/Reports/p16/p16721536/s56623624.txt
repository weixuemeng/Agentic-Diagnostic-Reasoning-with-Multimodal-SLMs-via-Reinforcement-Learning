                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p cabg  // eval for effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 15:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 Again seen is an ET tube, approximately 4.6 cm above the carina; an NG tube,
 with tip overlying gastric fundus;  bilateral chest tubes; a mediastinal
 drain; and a Swan-Ganz catheter, with tip over the proximal right pulmonary
 artery. No pneumothorax detected.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy, with prosthetic valve. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged,  allowing for technical
 differences. Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and
 mild vascular plethora, without overt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt significant change compared with ___.  A small left
 effusion would be difficult to exclude. No right-sided effusion is identified.
