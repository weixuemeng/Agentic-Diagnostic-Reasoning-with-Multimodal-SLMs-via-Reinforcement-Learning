                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with HTN, HLD, CAD s/p CABG, MR ___/p
 annuloplasty, and HFrEF (___%), here for increased dyspnea.  // CHF
 exacerbation, volume overload?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, cardiomegaly is stable.  Apparent
 blunting of left costophrenic sulcus may be due to leftward patient rotation.
 However, repeat nonrotated radiograph would be helpful to exclude a new left
 pleural effusion or localized lung parenchymal opacification in this region.
