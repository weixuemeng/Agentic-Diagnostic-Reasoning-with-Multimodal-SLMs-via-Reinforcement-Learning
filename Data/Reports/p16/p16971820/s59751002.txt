                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:22 P.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man for high-grade SBO and bowel ischemia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 7:22 p.m.:
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has progressed to severe global pulmonary
 consolidation, exaggerated by probable new posteriorly layering pleural
 effusions, small to moderate on the left, indeterminate on the right.  Heart
 size is normal.  Endoscope ends at the subcarinal level in the midline.  ET
 tube tip at the thoracic inlet in standard placement, left subclavian infusion
 port ends in the low SVC, right subclavian line in the upper SVC.  Thin-bore
 catheter tubing curled over the cardiac silhouette, tip projecting over the
 right atrium is unclear, unless it is a pericardial catheter.  Upper enteric
 drainage tube ends in the upper stomach but would need to be advanced 10 cm to
 move all the sideports below the GE junction.  Second endoesophageal device,
 ending in the distal esophagus is either a thermometer or manometer.
 
 Heart size is normal.  No pneumothorax.
