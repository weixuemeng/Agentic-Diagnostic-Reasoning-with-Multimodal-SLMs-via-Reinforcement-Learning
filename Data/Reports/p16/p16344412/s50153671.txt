 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tracheostomy tube appears to project over the midline trachea. 
 Again seen is extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the pectoralis muscles and
 cervical regions bilaterally.  Diffuse unchanged reticulonodular interstitial
 process with a more focal airspace confluent opacity at the right apex appears
 slightly improved compared to the prior exam. There is stable
 pneumoperitoneum. The previously noted pneumothorax is not well delineated on
 this exam.  There are stable bilateral small pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Tracheostomy tube appears to project over the midline trachea. The previously
 noted pneumothorax is not well delineated on this exam.
