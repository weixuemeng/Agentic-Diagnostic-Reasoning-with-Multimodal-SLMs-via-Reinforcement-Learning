                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female transferred for evaluation of intracranial
 hemorrhage.  Evaluate NGT/ETT placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside facility portable chest radiograph ___ at 01:29
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior outside facility chest radiograph performed 2 hr earlier,
 there has been interval repositioning of the endotracheal tube, which now
 terminates 4.0 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube terminates in the distal
 stomach/proximal duodenum.
 
 Minimal left retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis given rapid
 interval improvement since the recent radiograph.  Superimposed infection
 could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is otherwise
 no focal consolidation, sizeable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Heart size appears ___, ___ be due to
 portable technique.  No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 Right lower quadrant 4 x 2 cm opacity might represent liver or adrenal or less
 likely renal finding.  Assessment with US is to be considered.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ETT terminates 4.0 cm above the carina.
 2. NGT in distal stomach/proximal duodenum.
 3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 4. Left retrocardiac atelectasis versus infection.
 Right lower quadrant 4 x 2 cm opacity might represent liver or adrenal or less
 likely renal finding.  Assessment with US is to be considered.
