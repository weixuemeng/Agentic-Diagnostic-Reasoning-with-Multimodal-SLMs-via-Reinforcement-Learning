                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with C5 injury; bilateral vertebral artery
 injury, R clavicular fracture.  // interval change     interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung
 volumes.  The left subclavian catheter is been pulled back to about the level
 of the cavoatrial junction.  Otherwise, there is little overall change in the
 appearance of the heart and lungs.  Opacification at the right base medially
 above the elevated hemidiaphragm could reflect crowding of vessels or
 atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia
 could be considered.
 Comminuted fracture of the right clavicle is again seen, as is a fusion device
 in the cervical spine.
