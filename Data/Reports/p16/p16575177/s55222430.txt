                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope with recent pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size remains borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contours are unchanged with marked tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again
 noted.  There are diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic
 aorta.  Diffuse mild to moderate interstitial abnormalities are re-
 demonstrated in both lungs, similar compared to the previous exam from ___.  No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen though
 assessment of the apices is obscured due to the patient's chin and neck soft
 tissues projecting over this region.  Compression deformity of a mid thoracic
 vertebral body is age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacity in the right lung base may reflect atelectasis but it is
 nonspecific.  Otherwise, little interval change compared to the previous exam
 with diffuse mild to moderate interstitial abnormality which may be chronic.
