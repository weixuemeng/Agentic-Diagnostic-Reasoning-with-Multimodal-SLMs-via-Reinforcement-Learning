                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with new onset of shivering and shaking with
 fever.  Recent pneumonia, on levofloxacin and recent pelvic fracture. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  There is slightly increased
 interstitial marking seen throughout the lungs, the chronicity of which is
 uncertain given lack of prior.  There is a more focal region of opacity
 projecting over the left mid lung.  Its etiology is uncertain and it could be
 due to confluence of shadows including the scapula.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic calcifications seen in
 the aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs are of
 uncertain chronicity, potentially chronic due to chronic underlying process or
 mild interstitial edema.  More focal region of opacity in the left mid lung
 could be due to confluence of shadows, although lung opacity is also possible.
 Consider PA and lateral to better characterize these findings, especially
 given this somewhat limited exam due to rotation and portable technique.
