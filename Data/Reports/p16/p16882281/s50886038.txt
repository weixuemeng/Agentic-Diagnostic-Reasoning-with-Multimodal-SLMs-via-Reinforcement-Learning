                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with questionable pneumonia versus
 pleural effusion, lateral and PA chest examination advised by interpreter of
 previous portable chest examination obtained 4 hours earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is compared with the next preceding portable chest
 examination obtained five hours earlier during the same day. Mild cardiac
 enlargement as before.  Thoracic aorta of normal dimension but calcium
 deposits are seen in the wall, mostly at the level of the arch.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  Similar as suspected on the preceding portable
 chest examination, there are bilateral scattered patchy, sometimes
 confluenting infiltrates in the lung bases.  The lateral view discloses the
 predominant postero-inferior location in the posterior dependent portion of
 the lower lobes.  Minor pleural effusion cannot be excluded but major
 effusions are not present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral scattered patchy pneumonic infiltrates consistent with
 multifocal pneumonitis.  Followup examination is recommended.
