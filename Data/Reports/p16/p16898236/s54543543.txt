                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and hyponatremia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart appears normal in size. 
 Patchy calcification is noted along the aortic arch.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged allowing for differences in technique.  In
 addition to bilateral hilar fullness and upper zone redistribution of the
 pulmonary vascularity, there is a mild interstitial abnormality suggesting
 fluid overload or mild vascular congestion.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
