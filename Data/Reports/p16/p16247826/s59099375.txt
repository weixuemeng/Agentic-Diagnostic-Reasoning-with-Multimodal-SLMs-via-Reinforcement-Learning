                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke with swallowing difficulties and possible aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower
 lung volumes.  There is increased opacification in the mid and lower lung on
 the right.  Although this could represent asymmetric edema or atelectasis, in
 view of the clinical situation the possibility of aspiration pneumonia should
 be seriously considered.  Less prominent and more reticular changes are seen
 on the left.  Again this could represent merely atelectasis or another focus
 of consolidation.  
 
 Nasogastric tube extends at least to the mid body of the stomach where it
 crosses the lower margin of the image.
