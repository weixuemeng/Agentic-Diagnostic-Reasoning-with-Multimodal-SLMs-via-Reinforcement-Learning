 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, dyspnea  // evaluate for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___ and
 CT trachea dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded and clear.  Heart size is normal.  Bilateral hilar
 prominence appear similar to prior, and again may reflect prominent vessels. 
 Previous described streaky opacity in the left mid lung is resolved.  The
 costophrenic angles are not well evaluated on the lateral view due to
 technique.  No pneumothorax.  Chronic deformity of the left humaral head is
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Bilateral hilar prominence, unchanged, likely due to prominent vascular
 structures.
