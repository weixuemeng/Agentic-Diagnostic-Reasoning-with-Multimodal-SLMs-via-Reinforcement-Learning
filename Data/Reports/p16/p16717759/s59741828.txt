                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Cystic
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Glioblastoma,radiation therapy, mechanical
 fall, left rib pain  // Glioblastoma,radiation therapy, mechanical fall, left
 rib pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The hila and pleura are
 unremarkable.  No focal consolidations, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax are
 seen.  Left humeral head replacement and associated hardware are seen.
 
 If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is clinically warranted,  the
 location of any referable focal findings  should be clearly marked and imaged
 with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT scanning.  Given patient's
 history of shoulder repair all follow-up dedicated shoulder views are
 recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of left rib fracture within the limitations of plain film
 radiography.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend dedicated plain film shoulder views for further
 evaluation.
