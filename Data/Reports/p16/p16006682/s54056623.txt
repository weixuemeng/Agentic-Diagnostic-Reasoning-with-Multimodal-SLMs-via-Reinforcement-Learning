                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Myeloma, new cough and wheezing.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are essentially clear except for
 bibasilar linear opacities most likely reflecting areas of atelectasis but
 more pronounced than on the prior study.  It might potentially reflect
 infectious process.  Lateral view demonstrates compression fractures at the
 multiple levels, better appreciated on the CT of the thoracic spine.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
