                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  AML with bibasilar crackles, hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, skeletal survey
 ___, chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is stable appearance of a right subclavian port with tip
 terminating in the upper SVC.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia. Pulmonary vasculature is within normal
 limits.  Linear atelectasis is present at the left lung base.
 
 Again seen are multiple rounded opacities in the right mid and lower lung zone
 that appear, when examining multiple prior studies, to maintain a close
 relationship to ribs and likely represent old healed rib fractures.  In
 retrospect, these rib lesions were present on the skeletal survey from ___.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Linear atelectasis at the left lung base. No pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
