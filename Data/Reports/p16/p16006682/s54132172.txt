                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma, status post autologous stem cell transplant
 with neutropenia and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is a right subclavian line which appears to reside in
 the more centrally overall with tip terminating in the mid-to-low SVC.  A new
 sharp turn in this catheter is present.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Round densities
 overlying the right lateral chest represent old rib fractures. Slight
 increased opacity at the left lung base is present. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. New left basilar opacity, which may represent atelectasis or pneumonia in
 the correct clinical setting.
 2. Right subclavian line remains in acceptable position but with new acute
 angle. No action is needed if the line is functioning appropriately.
