                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation.  Evaluation for endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable supine view of the chest demonstrates relatively
 low lung volumes.  Theendotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.0 cm above
 the level of the carina, and could be retracted aproximately 1 cm.  A
 nasogastric tube is also seen coursing below the level of diaphragm and out of
 view.  No focal consolidations, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not significantly changed
 since the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 2 cm above the level of the carina and could
 be retracted by 1 cm.
 2.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
