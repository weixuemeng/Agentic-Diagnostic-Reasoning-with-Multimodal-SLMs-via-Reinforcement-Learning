                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cerebral infarct.  Evaluate position of orogastric tube.
 
 CHEST:  The tip of the orogastric tube lies in the subdiaphragmatic position
 and is likely to be satisfactory, though the tip is not seen.
 
 On the previous chest x-ray, the endotracheal tube was somewhat low and
 remains in the same position, and lies between 1.5 and 2 cm from the carinal
 angle and should be withdrawn approximately 1-1.5 cm to better position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Orogastric tube, position satisfactory.  Endotracheal tube
 remains somewhat low.
