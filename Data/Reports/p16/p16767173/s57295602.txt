                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath, new hypoxia, ___%
 saturation on room air.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Heart remains stably enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are difficult to
 assess given patient rotation on the current study.  Small bibasilar layering
 pleural effusions with associated patchy airspace disease, likely reflecting
 compressive atelectasis.  In addition, there is increasing perihilar fullness
 and slightly more prominent interstitial markings suggestive of mild perihilar
 and interstitial edema.  No pneumothorax.  Patient's mandible obscures the
 lung apices.
