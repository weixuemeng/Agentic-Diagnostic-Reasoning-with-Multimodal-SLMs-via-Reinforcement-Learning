                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with with history of congestive heart failure, now
 with cough and subjective fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild interstitial prominence.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta
 is tortuous.  There is fullness along the right paratracheal stripe.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interstitial prominence, which could be secondary to mild edema or
 inflammation/viral infection.  
 
 2.  Fullness along the right paratracheal stripe, which could represent
 lymphadenopathy, although commonly this appearance is associated with
 tortuosity of the great vessels.  In the setting of possible infection, this
 could be reactive, however followup chest radiograph is recommended to see
 whether the contour convexity persists. 
 
 Findings and recommendations were discussed with ___ ___ by ___
 ___ by telephone at 09:15 on ___ at the time of initial review
 of the study.
