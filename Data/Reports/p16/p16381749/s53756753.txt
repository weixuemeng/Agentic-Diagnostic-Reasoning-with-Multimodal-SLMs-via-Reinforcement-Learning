                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hemoptysis, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears mild to moderately enlarged with a somewhat
 globular configuration.  Mediastinal contour is similar.  The hila bilaterally
 are prominent, but this is unchanged from the previous examination.  There is
 mild pulmonary vascular engorgement without frank pulmonary edema.  Dense
 retrocardiac opacity is new from the prior study.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  While this could
 be due to cardiomyopathy, the somewhat globular configuration raises concern
 for a possible pericardial effusion and correlation with echocardiogram is
 suggested.
 2. Pulmonary vascular engorgement.
 3. Dense retrocardiac opacity concerning for pneumonia in the correct clinical
 setting.
