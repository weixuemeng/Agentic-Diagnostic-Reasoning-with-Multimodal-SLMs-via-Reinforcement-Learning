                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with pneumothorax.  Assess for pneumothorax, following
 chest tube repositioning.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Two chest radiographs from the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates small right pneumothorax,
 significantly decreased in size from exam obtained one hour prior.  The right
 lung demonstrates improved aeration.  Ill-defined opacities in the right lung
 base likely represent atelectasis.  Left lung is well expanded without pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 Heart size is normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 In comparison to study obtained one hour prior, there is significant interval
 improvement in right pneumothorax, which is now small.
