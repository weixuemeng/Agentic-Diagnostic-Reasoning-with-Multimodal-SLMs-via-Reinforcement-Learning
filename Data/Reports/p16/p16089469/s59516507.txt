 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 18:11
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right hemothorax and multiple rib
 fractures, now with increasing air leak, question interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 14:06.
 
 Single portable upright chest film, ___ at 18:11 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right chest tube remains in place with its tip at the apex.  There is
 persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with patchy opacity at the
 right base which either reflects loculated pleural fluid within the horizontal
 fissure or could represent an evolving pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  The left lung remains grossly clear.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.
