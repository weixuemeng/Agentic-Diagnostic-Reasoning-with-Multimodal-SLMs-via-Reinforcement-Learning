                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of right rib fractures and pneumothorax. 
 Assess for pneumothorax following chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable view of the chest demonstrates interval removal of
 right-sided chest tube.  Large right pneumothorax is unchanged.  Heterogeneous
 opacity in the right lung base likely represents atelectasis, stable.  Right
 costophrenic angle is not included in this study.  Left lung remains well
 expanded without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter projects over mid SVC. 
 Fixation hardware for several right sided fractured ribs are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent large right pneumothorax following right chest tube removal.
