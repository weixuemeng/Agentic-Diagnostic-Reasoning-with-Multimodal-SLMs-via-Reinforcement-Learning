                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 19:49
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hemothorax and tracheal tube placement,
 status post bronch and chest tube placement.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 18:11.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 19:49 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which has its tip 7 cm above
 the carina.  Advancement several centimeters would be advised.  Nasogastric
 tube has also been placed and is seen coursing below the diaphragm.  The right
 chest tube remains unchanged in position.
 
 2.  There continues to be hazy opacity at the right base and right mid lung,
 likely representing layering of fluid within the pleural cavity with some
 associated atelectasis.  Bibasilar air bronchograms are seen likely reflecting
 atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Linear
 opacities at the left base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  No pneumothorax.  A wet reading of this study was provided to ___,
 the trauma nurse, ___ ___. ___ on ___ at 21:25.
