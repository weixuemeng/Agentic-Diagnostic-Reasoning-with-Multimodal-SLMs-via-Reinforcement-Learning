                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with multiple right rib fractures and
 right hemothorax after fall.  Status post orthopedic repairs of right seventh,
 eighth and ninth ribs.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is normal, no configurational abnormality is
 identified.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  There are three well-aligned rib fractures bridged by metallic
 plates and multiple fixation screws.  This concerns the lateral portions of
 ___ 7, 8 and 9 on the right side.  The alignment is anatomical.  The
 previously described remaining pleural density has markedly regressed and only
 a mild degree of blunting of the right pleural sinus is present.  As there is
 no increased density in the posterior pleural sinuses on the lateral view,
 remaining pleural effusion can be excluded.  No remaining pneumothorax in the
 right apical area which had already been regressed to minimal size on the next
 preceding study.
