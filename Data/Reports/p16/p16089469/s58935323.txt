 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Rib fractures, pulmonary contusion, assessment for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The right-sided rib fractures are barely visible.  However, the
 resulting atelectasis, elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and small right
 pleural effusion are unchanged.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  No changes in
 appearance of the normal cardiac silhouette and of the left lung parenchyma.
