                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right chest tube placement for hemothorax in patient with multiple
 rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right chest tube is in place and there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There are lower lung volumes.  Opacification at the right base
 silhouetting the hemidiaphragm most likely reflects layering of pleural
 effusions that has a different appearance because this is a supine AP view
 rather than an erect PA view.  Bibasilar atelectatic changes are apparent.
