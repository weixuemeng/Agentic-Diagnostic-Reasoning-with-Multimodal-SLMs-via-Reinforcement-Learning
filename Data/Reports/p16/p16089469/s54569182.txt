                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right-sided rib pain after a fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Screw and plate fixation of three right-sided rib fractures (7, 8
 and 9) appear unchanged.  No newly displaced fracture is identified although a
 persistent non-displaced lucency is seen along the right eighth rib.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  As compared to the prior examination, a right-sided
 effusion appears decreased, though a small effusion may persist.  Elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm appears stable.  No focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia is seen.  Patchy scarring is unchanged in the right mid lung.  The
 heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of screw and plate fixation of right-sided rib
 fractures, including persistent unhealed lucency through the right eighth rib
 without displacement.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Decreased right pleural
 effusion although a small persistent effusion is suspected.
