                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post chest tube placement on waterseal
 yesterday with concern for pneumothorax, here to assess for interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable erect AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since ___ despite the presence of  right apical chest
 drainage tube, a moderate to large right pneumothorax has grown, accounting
 for increased right lower lobe atelectasis and mild leftward deviation of the
 mediastinum, but no depression of the right hemidiagphragm.    A right
 internal jugular central venous catheter still ends in the mid-to-low SVC. 
 There is no appreciable pleural effusion, and no pneumonia.  Heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Surgical fixation plates
 and screws are intact spanning right ribs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarging moderate to large right pneumothorax sufficient to
 shift mediastinum contralaterally, but not to displace the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 Findings were telphoned by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ in the SICU at 9:28
 a.m. on ___.
