                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female presenting for evaluation of left lower
 rib/left upper quadrant pain after being punched 2 days ago.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT abdomen/ pelvis ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no focal consolidation.  Streaky bibasilar opacities most likely
 represent atelectasis, as seen on the recent CT abdomen/pelvis performed on
 the same date.  Small left pleural effusion.  No pleural effusion on the
 right.  No pneumothorax.  Heart is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pneumothorax.
 2. Small left pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis.
 3. Mild cardiomegaly.
 4.  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen,
 conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or
 characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to
 the chest wall is clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal
 findings  should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail
 radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
