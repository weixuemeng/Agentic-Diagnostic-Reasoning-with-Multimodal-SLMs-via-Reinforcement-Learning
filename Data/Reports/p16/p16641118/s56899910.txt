                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of sickle cell disease with pain
 bilateral ribs
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC.  Mild cardiomegaly
 is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities are seen within the left lung
 base, potentially atelectasis, and not substantially changed from the prior
 exam.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.  H-shaped vertebra are compatible with a history of sickle cell
 disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left basilar opacity is likely atelectasis, similar to that seen on the
 prior radiograph.
