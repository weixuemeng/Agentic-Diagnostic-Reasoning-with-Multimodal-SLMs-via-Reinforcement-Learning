                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lung
 volumes are low, accentuating the bronchovascular structures.  This may
 account for an apparent new interstitial abnormality in the lungs,
 superimposed upon chronic upper lobe predominant emphysema.  No confluent
 areas of consolidation are observed, and there are no pleural effusions or
 acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable new diffuse interstitial abnormality, possibly due
 to crowding of normal bronchovascular structures related to low lung volumes. 
 Repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory level would be helpful to exclude
 a true interstitial process such as atypical pneumonia or interstitial edema.
