                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Attempted self extubation, evaluation for endotracheal tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The tip of the endotracheal tube currently projects 2.7 cm above the
 carina.  The other monitoring and support devices are constant.  The lung
 volumes continue to be low, with bilateral basal areas of opacities with
 symmetrical distribution.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  No larger pleural
 effusions.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
