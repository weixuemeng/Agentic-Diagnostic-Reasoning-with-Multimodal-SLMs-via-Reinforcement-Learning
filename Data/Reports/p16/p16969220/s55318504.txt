 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are well expanded and clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are normal.  No displaced rib fracture is identified, although the
 inferior most left lower costal margin is not imaged.

 although the inferior most left lower costal margin is not completely imaged. 
 If clinically desired, dedicated rib series with a BB marker at site of
