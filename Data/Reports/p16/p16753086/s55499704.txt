                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ as well as scout view for more
 recent PET-CT performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the
 carina. A right subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the right
 atrium.  An orogastric tube courses into the stomach; its tip not visualized. 
 The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 within normal limits.  Patchy opacity at the left lung base suggests minor
 atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute process.
