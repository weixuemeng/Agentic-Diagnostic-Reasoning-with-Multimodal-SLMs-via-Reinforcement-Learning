                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with rash and neuropathy, concerning for
 sarcoidosis.  Evaluate for lymphadenopathy.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  However, there is no focal consolidation, and
 no effusion or pneumothorax.  Minimal left basilar opacities are likely
 atelectasis.  Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is some
 prominence of the left hilum, likely reflecting arterial structures, given the
 lack of adenopathy seen on the lateral view.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or edema. 
 Degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine, without acute osseous
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No convincing evidence of thoracic lymphadenopathy.
