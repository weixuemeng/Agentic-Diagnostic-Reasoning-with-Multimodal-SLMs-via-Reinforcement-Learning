 There are persistent low lung volumes.  There has been minimal improvement of
 opacities in the right perihilar region and right mid lung consistent with
 postoperative changes.  The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  There
 is no pleural effusion.  There is a small right pneumothorax, better seen in
 the lateral view.  A right chest tube remains in place.  Right subcutaneous
 emphysema has increased. Left lower atelectasis.  no new opacities.
