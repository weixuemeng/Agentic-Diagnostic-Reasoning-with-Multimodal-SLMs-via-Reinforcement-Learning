                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man on chemotherapy for lymphomatoid granulomatosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___, read in conjunction with
 a chest CT on ___:
 
 Right upper lobe lung nodule reported as new on ___ chest CT can be seen
 on ___ chest radiograph, projecting over the second rib, and has
 subsequently involuted.  Also resolved since ___ is the mass-like lesion in
 the right middle lobe in the region of prior surgery.  The scattered
 peribronchial ground-glass abnormalities in the lung seen on ___ might not
 be readily apparent on conventional chest radiographs, but they certainly have
 not worsened.  Overall, there are no radiographic findings to suggest
 intrathoracic infection, although of course, CT scanning would be more
 sensitive in their detection.  Heart size is normal.  There is no appreciable
 pleural effusion.
