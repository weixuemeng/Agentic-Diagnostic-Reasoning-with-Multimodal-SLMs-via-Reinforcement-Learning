                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a somewhat
 better inspiration.  Increasing opacification at the right base medially with
 silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm is worrisome for a right middle lobe
 consolidation.  The left lung is relatively clear and there is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
