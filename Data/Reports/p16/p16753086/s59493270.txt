                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with right-sided thoracotomy related to right
 middle lobectomy, check interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding portable AP chest examination of ___.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Heart size and mediastinal structures are unchanged.  As before, there is a
 diffuse density occupying the right-sided cardio-diaphragmatic angle in this
 patient status post recent right middle lobectomy.  In addition, a round
 density with a diameter of about 2-3 cm is seen, similar as before.  This
 density matches the previously identified (chest CT of ___) density
 and the finding appears to be stable.  There is no evidence of new pulmonary
 parenchymal abnormalities, and the pleural spaces and the lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses remain free.  The previously identified minimal
 apical pneumothorax on the right side cannot be identified anymore.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  No new acute abnormalities.  Previously
 described densities and status post right middle lobectomy unchanged.
