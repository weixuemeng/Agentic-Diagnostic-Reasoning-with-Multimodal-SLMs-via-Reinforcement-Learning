                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post right middle lobe biopsy.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier.
 
 Small right pneumothorax has improved.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Right IJ catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction.  Right middle
 lobe mass and right lower lobe nodule are better seen on prior CT performed
 seven hours earlier.  If any, there is a small right pleural effusion.
