                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypotension after a biopsy of a right lower
 lobe mass.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Subsequent chest CT performed two hours after this exam and CT
 chest without contrast on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: AP upright chest radiohgraph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Poor lung volumes account for vascular crowding.  There are no
 focal opacities in the left lung.  A rounded consolidation abutting the right
 hemidiaphragm is noted in the right lower lung region which is unchanged
 compared with prior CT and corresponds to known lung mass.  There is no
 evidence of abdominal free air or pleural effusion.  A subsequent chest CT
 demonstrated the presence of pneumothorax, which is poorly seen on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe mass unchanged from prior examination. Right
 pneumothorax is better seen on subsequent CT.
