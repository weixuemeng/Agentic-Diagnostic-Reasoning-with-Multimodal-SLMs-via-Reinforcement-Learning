 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain, intermittent weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy
 opacities are noted at the lung bases.  Small right pleural effusion is noted
 with blunting of the posterior costophrenic sulcus on the lateral view.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.

 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities at the lung bases, potentially
 atelectasis but infection cannot be completely excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.  Small right pleural effusion.
