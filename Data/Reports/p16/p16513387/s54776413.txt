                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with intermittent chest pain
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Wispy opacity abutting the left
 heart border is most likely atelectasis, less likely pneumonia. Otherwise the
 lungs are clear.  No edema, effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Wispy opacity abutting the left heart border is most compatible with
 atelectasis, less likely early pneumonia. Please correlate with exam.
