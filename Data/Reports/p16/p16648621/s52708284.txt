                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bed-bound patient with worsening wheezing and wet-sounding lungs.
 Evaluate for interval change in pulmonary edema versus infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.  CT
 torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post midline sternotomy and CABG.  There is
 pulmonary vascular congestion, without frank interstitial pulmonary edema. 
 Heterogeneous right lower lung opacities are likely compressive atelectasis,
 although infection is not excluded.  Minimal left retrocardiac atelectasis is
 slightly decreased.  A moderate layering right pleural effusion is thought
 likely, slightly decreased in size.  There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is not significantly changed.  Bulging of the hilar contours was
 seen to be marked lymphadenopathy on CT from ___.  There is no
 change in the hilar contours to suggest that the degree of lymphadenopathy has
 increased.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Probable moderate right pleural effusion, slightly smaller than on ___.
 
 2.  Unchanged right lower lung heterogeneous opacities, possibly atelectasis
 versus infection.  Further evaluation with a lateral radiograph is
 recommended.
 
 3.  Pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 11:51 p.m.
 via telephone on the day of the study.
