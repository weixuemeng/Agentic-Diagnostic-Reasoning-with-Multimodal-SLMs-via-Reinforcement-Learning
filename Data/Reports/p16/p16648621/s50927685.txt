                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Inability to swallow or handled secretions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 is unchanged as is tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Diffuse thoracic aortic
 calcifications are again demonstrated.  There is perihilar haziness with
 vascular indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary edema, similar when
 compared to the prior study.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally
 is compatible with the presence of small bilateral pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  Retrocardiac opacity likely is reflective of
 atelectasis.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions and
 retrocardiac atelectasis.
