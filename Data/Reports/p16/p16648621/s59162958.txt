                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy.  There is continued elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, increased since the prior study and was likely a subpulmonic
 effusion.  Underlying infectious process is not excluded.  There is prominence
 of the pulmonary vasculature bilaterally concerning for fluid overload. 
 Asymmetric right pulmonary opacity could represent asymmetric edema and
 pleural effusion however, early infectious process is not excluded.  The
 lateral view is suboptimal due to patient motion and overlying soft tissue. 
 Degenerative change is seen in the right shoulder joint and the right
 acromioclavicular joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Right basilar opacity with perceived elevated
 right hemidiaphragm is likely due to a subpulmonic pleural effusion. 
 Additional right base opacity is concerning for a possible superimposed
 infectious process.  However, prominence of the bilateral pulmonary
 vasculature is concerning for fluid overload.  Cardiac silhouette remains
 enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.
