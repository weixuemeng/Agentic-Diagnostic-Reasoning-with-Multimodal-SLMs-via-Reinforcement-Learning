                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with end-stage renal
 disease, history of mechanical valve replacement with concern for pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance.  Minimal interstitial
 edema cannot be excluded.  Right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Right basal
 opacity appears to be unchanged.  It might reflect the combination of
 atelectasis and pleural effusion, although infectious process remains a
 possibility.
