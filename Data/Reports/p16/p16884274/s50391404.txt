 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with obesity and CHF pw hypotension and concern
 for sepsis of unclear etiology  // Assess for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric
 tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube projects
 over the middle parts of the stomach.  The lung volumes remain low and a
 pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis is slightly more extensive than on the
 previous image.  Minimally increasing diameters of pulmonary vessels might
 reflect pulmonary edema.  No larger pleural effusions.
