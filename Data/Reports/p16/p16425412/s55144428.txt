                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays dated ___
 
 There is hyperinflation suggesting COPD.  Compared to ___ and allowing for
 technical differences and lower inspiratory volumes, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, with slight cardiac enlargement, is probably unchanged. 
 Atelectasis and/or scarring at both lung bases is unchanged.  More diffuse
 parenchymal scarring is likely present.  There is a curvilinear line at the
 right lung apex.  The appearance raises the question of a pneumothorax, but
 there are lung markings noted in the apex beyond this and, given this, this
 most likely represents artifact due to a skinfold.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Probable right apical skin fold artifact. Small ppneumothorac is considered
 much less likely. If clinically indicated, an additional frontal radiograph
 obtained at end expiration could help to further assess for right-sided
 pneumothorax.
 
 2) Otherwise, I doubt significant change compared with ___.  No evidence
 of CHF.  No new pneumonic infiltrate or effusion is identified.
