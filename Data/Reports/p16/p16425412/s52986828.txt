                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  COPD and cough for one year, worse, feels weak.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patchy left
 basilar opacity raises concern for pneumonia.  There is also subtle right
 basilar opacity to a lesser degree and right base infection or aspiration is
 not excluded.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Minimal biapical pleural thickening is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable, as are the hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar opacity raises concern for pneumonia.  Subtle
 right base opacity to a lesser extent could be a second site of infection or
 aspiration.
