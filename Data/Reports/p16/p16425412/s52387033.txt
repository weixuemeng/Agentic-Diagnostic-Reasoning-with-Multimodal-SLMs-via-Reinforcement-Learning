                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p renal transplant, aspergillosis on lifelong
 vori presenting with 2 days cough  // acute consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Small right upper lobe
 nodular opacity at level of second anterior rib is similar compared to earlier
 radiographs. Minimal bibasilar opacities are improved compared to prior
 radiographs. Mild elevation of left hemidiaphragm is unchanged. No pleural
 effusion or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute pneumonia, but CT would be more sensitive for detecting
 early signs of infection, especially considering the presence of chronic chest
 radiograph abnormalities in this patient.
