                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears borderline enlarged, unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic
 knob.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Bronchial wall thickening and
 peribronchial opacities involving the lower lobes is re- demonstrated
 compatible with bronchiectasis and airways inflammation.  Compared to the
 previous study, and there may be a slightly worse patchy opacities in both
 lower lobes.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic bilateral lower lobe bronchiectasis with slight interval worsening of
 patchy opacities in both lower lobes which may suggest worsening chronic
 airways inflammation or infection.
