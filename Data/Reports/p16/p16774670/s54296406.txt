                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube placement.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 2:57 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 nasogastric tube.  The tip of the tube ends in the stomach, but the sidehole
 is still positioned in the distal parts of the esophagus.  The endotracheal
 tube has been minimally advanced.  Its tip is now 5.3 cm above the carina. 
 There is increasing right basal opacity, likely caused by progressive
 infection or aspiration.  The other monitoring and support devices are
 constant in appearance.
