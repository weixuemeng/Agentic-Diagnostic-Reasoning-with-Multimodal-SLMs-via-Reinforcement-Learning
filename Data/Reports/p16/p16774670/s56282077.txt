                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever, tachypnea, and nausea and vomiting.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right-sided Port-A-Cath is in place with its tip at the
 cavoatrial junction.  The heart size is within normal limits, and the
 mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs show right apical
 opacity in a well-demarcated pattern, likely reflecting post-radiation changes
 as seen on prior CT.  However, there are no other areas of consolidation. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Post-radiation changes of the right apex but no new consolidation
 to suggest pneumonia.
