                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 small right pleural effusion as well as right basilar opacity.  Patchy left
 base opacity is also seen.  Esophageal stent is similar in appearance in
 position as compared to the prior study.  A Port-A-Cath is again seen,
 terminating in the low SVC.  The aorta remains tortuous.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion.  Right basilar opacities and
 scattered left mid-to-lower lung opacities could be due to pneumonia due to
 infection and/or aspiration.  There appears to be air-fluid level in the
 region of the distal esophagus.
