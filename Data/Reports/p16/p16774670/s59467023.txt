                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent Dobhoff tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi upright chest radiograph.  Endotracheal tube terminates just
 beyond the clavicular heads, somewhat obscured by the EKG lead wires
 approximately 5.6 cm above the carina, and should not be withdrawn further. 
 Enteric feeding tube terminates in the upper stomach with tip curled
 backwards/superiorly pointing towards the GE junction.  
 
 Multifocal parenchymal opacities most pronounced in the mid and lower right
 lung and left lower lobe are slightly more conspicuous than on the previous
 examination which in the setting of known multifocal pneumonia may be related
 to a combination of hypoventilation and increased conspicuity in the context
 of increased mild pulmonary edema.  Heart and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  The right subclavian Port-A-Cath terminates in the right
 atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Dobbhoff tube terminates in the upper stomach with tip curled superiorly
 and could be advanced 5-7 cm.  
 
 2.  Increased conspicuity of parenchymal opacities in the context of increased
 mild pulmonary edema.
