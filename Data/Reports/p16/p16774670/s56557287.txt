 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Stent, followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the esophageal stent is in
 a more cranial position than before.  The stent still appears to be correctly
 positioned.  The pre-existing opacities in the right lung and at the bases of
 the left lung have substantially decreased in extent and severity.  On today's
 examination, a peribronchial pattern of chronic-appearing changes persists. 
 No pleural effusions.  Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.  The
 lateral radiograph shows an air-fluid level around the esophagus.
