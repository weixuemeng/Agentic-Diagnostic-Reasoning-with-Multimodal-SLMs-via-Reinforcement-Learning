                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after esophagectomy due to
 esophageal cancer.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with comparison to PET-CT from
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contour is distorted with slight
 widening due to neoesophagus position.  There is evidence of right chest tube
 and NG tube in place.  The NG tube tip is just at the level of the hiatus. 
 The right chest tube tip is projecting at the level of the carina.  The right
 Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.  Upper left
 mediastinal drain is present.  Subcutaneous air within the right chest wall is
 seen.  Bibasilar consolidations, most likely reflect areas of atelectasis. 
 Pneumoperitoneum is present, related to prior surgery.
