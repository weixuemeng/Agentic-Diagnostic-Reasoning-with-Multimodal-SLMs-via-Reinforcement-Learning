                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Feeding tube coils in the region of the thoracoabdominal junction,
 with distal tip directed cephalad in the lower portion of the neoesophagus. 
 At the time of this dictation, the tube has been repositioned as documented on
 subsequently dictated chest radiographs.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable.  Persistent pulmonary vascular engorgement accompanied by
 asymmetrically distributed combined alveolar interstitial pattern, most likely
 due to pulmonary edema.  This appears somewhat asymmetric involving the right
 lung to a greater degree than the left, and it is uncertain whether this
 represents asymmetrical pulmonary edema or a secondary process such as
 infection is present.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are also
 demonstrated.
