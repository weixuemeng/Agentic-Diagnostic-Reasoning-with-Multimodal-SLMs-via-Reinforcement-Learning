                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 317 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sepsis from multifocal pneumonia and
 increasing oxygen requirement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 317 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A right subclavian Port-A-Cath remains in place with its tip in the
 proximal right atrium, unchanged.  There is increasing consolidation within
 both lower lobes and throughout the right upper and mid lung.  These findings
 are concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  In addition, there are subtle
 developing opacities in the left upper lobe.  No large pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  Sclerosis involving the right coracoid process is consistent with
 known metastatic disease.
