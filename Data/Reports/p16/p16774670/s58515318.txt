                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recent nasogastric tube placement,
 check position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 751.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Two portable supine views of the chest were acquired sequentially with the
 first image demonstrating a nasogastric tube just at the level of the
 diaphragm and on the subsequent image, the tube has been advanced and now
 projects over the stomach.  The right subclavian port-a-cath and endotracheal
 tube are unchanged in position.  There continue to be bibasilar patchy
 opacities as well as more subtle opacities in the right upper and mid lung and
 left upper lung.  These findings are not significantly changed and are
 concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  There is likely a small left effusion
 given that the costophrenic angle now appears blunted.  No pneumothorax. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Sclerosis of the right
 coracoid process consistent with known metastasis.
