                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size but demonstrates left ventricular
 configuration.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified, without change.  Recently
 described left lower lobe abnormality has rapidly improved with small residual
 opacity remaining.  Additional right retrocardiac opacity has slightly
 improved as well.  Bilateral pleural effusions are small and similar to the
 recent radiograph.  Bones are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Rapidly improving basilar opacities favor atelectasis or aspiration over
 infectious pneumonia.
 
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
