                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated assess line placement.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained.  Endotracheal tube
 terminates in mid trachea.  Right internal jugular transvenous pacing wire is
 looped in the right pulmonary artery can be withdrawn approximately 16 cm for
 more optimal positioning within the right ventricle.  Diffuse haze over the
 right hemithorax likely reflects layering pleural effusion.  Increased
 pulmonary vascular congestion is also seen without focal consolidation.  The
 heart is modestly enlarged with normal mediastinal contours.  There is no
 pneumothorax. At least 1 right rib fracture is suggested.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Venous pacing lead projects over the main pulmonary artery and could be
 withdrawn approximately 16 cm.  
 
 2.  Likely layering right pleural effusion without pneumothorax.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  
 
 3.  At least 1 right-sided rib fracture.
