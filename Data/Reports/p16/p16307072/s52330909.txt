                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post AVR, CABG, question effusion.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, which accentuates the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and vascular markings.  The patient is status post sternotomy and
 extensive hardware along the anterior midline chest wall.  The heart is not
 enlarged.  There is mild upper zone redistribution, suggesting mild fluid
 overload.  There are small bilateral effusions posteriorly and there appears
 to be some volume loss in the lower lobes.  There is also atelectasis in the
 right mid zone.  
 
 Compared with ___, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed.  Otherwise, I
 doubt gross interval change.
