                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and
 right-sided Pleurx catheter for recurrent effusion, now with shortness of
 breath, evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided chest tube remains in place, though the tip has now
 moved inferiorly into the costophrenic sulcus.  A large right-sided effusion
 is not significantly changed compared with ___.  Minimal aerated right lung
 is similar in appearance, as is chronic collapse of the right upper lobe.  A
 moderate-to-large sized left pleural effusion has increased in the interim,
 with adjacent atelectasis of the basal segments of the left lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Only a small amount of residual aerated lung is present in the
 right chest.  On the left, an effusion has increased in size, resulting in
 collapse of the basal segments of the left lower lobe.
