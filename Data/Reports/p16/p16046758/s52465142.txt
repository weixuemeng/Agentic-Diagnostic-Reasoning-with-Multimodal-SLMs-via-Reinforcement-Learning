                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pleural effusion, status post
 left-sided Pleurx catheter placement today.  Prior right-sided Pleurx remains.
 Evaluate for possible pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study ___ ___.  Advanced right-sided pleural effusion with only small
 remaining aerated lung portion remains unchanged.  The same holds for the
 right-sided Pleurx catheter.  On the left side, pleurocentesis has been
 performed successfully, and the moderately sized left-sided pleural effusion
 seen on the previous examination has been removed.  The diaphragmatic contour
 on the left side is now detectable and one sees only a linear plate
 atelectasis in the adjacent lung area on the left lung base.  No new
 parenchymal infiltrates are seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax on
 either side.
