                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of lung cancer status post
 right bronchial stent on ___, with new shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again visualized is a similar appearance of right upper lobe,
 middle, and lower lobe opacities consistent with patient's history of known
 cavitary focus at the right upper lobe with loculated fluid as well as
 post-radiation changes at the right hilum.  A right mainstem bronchus stent is
 now visualized, with the proximal end of the stent within the trachea at the
 level of the carina and the more distal portion within the right mainstem
 bronchus.  Bibasilar opacities are noted and likely representative of
 bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 Multiple mediastinal and brachial tumor deposits are better delineated on
 dedicated CT chest from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable appearance of the right lung consistent with patient's history of
 cavitary focus at the right apex with loculated fluid as well as
 post-radiation changes in the right lung and hilar tissues.
 2.  Right mainstem bronchus stent is now visualized, with the most proximal
 end of the stent within the trachea at the level of the carina and the more
 distal end in the right mainstem bronchus, may be more proximal in position
 than desired.
 3.  Multiple known mediastinal and pericardial tumor deposits are better
 delineated on dedicated chest CT from ___.
