                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer,
 bilateral pleural effusions, bilateral Pleurx catheters, assess for interval
 changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison with prior study is difficult due to changes in
 obliquity.  Bilateral Pleurx catheters are unchanged.  Post-surgical and
 post-radiation changes are again noted in the right apex, but the apical
 cavity seen previously is no longer visualized.  Mild pulmonary edema seen
 previously is improved.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Resolution of pulmonary edema seen previously on the left.
