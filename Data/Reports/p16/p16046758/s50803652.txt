                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is improved aeration in the
 right lung.  However, much of the differences in appearance may simply be the
 upright technique, with substantial right pleural effusion extending along the
 right lateral chest wall to the apical region.  Displacement of midline
 structures to the right again seen.  Increasing opacification at the left base
 is consistent with pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis.  Most of the left
 lung is essentially clear.
