                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pulmonary effusion, status post
 thoracocentesis on the right, evaluate effusion and look for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable
 chest examination obtained eight hours earlier during the same day.  During
 the interval, a right-sided thoracocentesis has been performed and the right
 hemithorax becomes partially translucent again.  One can now identify a
 distorted pattern of the pulmonary vasculature in the right hemithorax
 suggestive of a mass in the right upper lobe area and elevation of the
 right-sided hemidiaphragm.  Quite obvious there is some degree of mediastinal
 shift towards the right side suggestive of major atelectatic and obstructive
 component in the process.  A preceding torso CT dated ___ revealed
 chronic post-surgical changes with associated volume loss as well as radiation
 fibrosis in the right upper lung.  The present findings on the portable chest
 examination match these findings grossly.
