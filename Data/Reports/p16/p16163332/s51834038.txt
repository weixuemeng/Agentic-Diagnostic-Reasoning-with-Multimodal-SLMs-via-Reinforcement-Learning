                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.
 
 There are bibasilar parenchymal opacities identified.  Given low lung volumes,
 however, these could be due to atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits, as are the osseous and
 soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities which could be due to atelectasis given low
 lung volumes, however, possibility of infection should also be considered in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
