 Comparison is made with prior studies including ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Transvenous pacer leads terminate in the
 standard position in the right atrium and right ventricle.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated consistent with emphysema.  Small pleural effusions have
 decreased from prior study ___.  Chronic right upper lobe peribronchial
 opacities are grossly unchanged.  Peribronchial opacities in the lower lobes
 bilaterally have improved.  There are no new lung abnormalities.  There is no
 evident pneumothorax.  There is no evidence of pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  Biapical scarring is stable and longstanding.  Mid
 thoracic compression deformities are again noted.
