                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypotension, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph was obtained.  A dual-lead
 pacer is in unchanged position with lead tips extending to the right atrium
 and right ventricle.  Retrocardiac opacity may indicate a left pleural
 effusion and left basilar consolidation.  The lungs are hyperlucent, which
 could indicate underlying emphysema.  The right lung is clear.  Patient is
 rotated to the left.  Atherosclerotic calcification along the thoracic aorta
 noted.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lung base opacity likely effusion and consolidation. 
 Overall, no significant change from prior exam.
