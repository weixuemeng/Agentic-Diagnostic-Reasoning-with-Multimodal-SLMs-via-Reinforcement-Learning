                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Productive cough and malaise.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  Slight scarring is similar to each lung apex.  There is
 perhaps a trace pleural effusion or scarring at the left lung base noting
 pleural thickening.  A new small right-sided pleural effusion is noted.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated.  There is background coarsening of lung markings that
 is similar to improved without definite focal consolidation.  The coarse
 appearance of the lung architecture probably reflects emphysema.  Mid thoracic
 compression deformities appear unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Emphysema.  Very small pleural effusions.  No definite evidence
 for pneumonia.
