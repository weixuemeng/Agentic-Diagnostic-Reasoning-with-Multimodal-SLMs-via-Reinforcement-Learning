                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Tachypneic, COPD.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There is moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly.  Transvenous pacemaker leads are in
 standard position, in the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is no
 pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are better seen in prior CT.  Increased opacity in the right upper
 lung is worrisome for aspiration, as it does opacities in the left lower lobe.
 Patient has known emphysema.
