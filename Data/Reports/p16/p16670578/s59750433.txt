                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with COPD, CHF, rapid decline over the last
 month, crackles at left lung field and right base.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ to ___, CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are new.  A retrocardiac opacity shadows over the supine on
 the lateral projection.  No new nodule or pneumothorax is present.  Cardiac
 contour is unchanged.  Aortic arch calcifications are stable.  Dual-chamber
 pacing lead project over the right atrium and right ventricle.  Mid thoracic
 vertebral plana is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased retrocardiac opacity most likely represents atelectasis, but
 consolidation cannot be excluded.
 2.  Small bibasilar effusions.
