                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Weakness.  Evaluate for infectious process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 There is cardiomegaly in this patient with status post sternotomy.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions as well as peribronchial cuffing suggestive of congestive
 changes are noted.  There is no definitive finding to suggest an acute
 pneumonic process.  The visualized osseous structures appear grossly normal. 
 I noted double right heart border, suggestive of mitral valve disease.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Findings are consistent with congestive change.  No definitive pneumonia.
