                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Wispy opacities projecting over the posterior lower lung, possibly left lower
 lobe are seen which may be due to atelectasis however, consolidation due to
 infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  The very
 inferior/posterior costophrenic angles are not fully included on the lateral
 view however, no large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Wispy opacities seen in the posterior lung base, possibly the left lung base,
 best seen on the lateral view.  While findings may relate to atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation due to infectious process is not excluded.
