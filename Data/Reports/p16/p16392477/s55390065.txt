 INDICATION:  Vertigo for two days.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes without
 pleural effusion, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax.  The hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is top normal.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.  Left cardiac border is obscured, most
 likely due to overlying soft tissues.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Pulmonary vascular congestion most commonly reflects cardiac decompensation.
 No pulmonary edema.
