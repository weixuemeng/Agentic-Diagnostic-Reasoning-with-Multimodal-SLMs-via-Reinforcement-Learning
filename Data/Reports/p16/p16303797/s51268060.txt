 Very low lung volume with patchy areas of subsegmental atelectasis and
 crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  No acute focal consolidation,
 pneumothorax or significant effusion.  Given for differences in technique, the
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable, with widening of the superior
 mediastinum.

 Endotracheal tube is in good position.  Very low lung volumes.
 
 Given differences in technique, the cardiomediastinal contours are stable,
 with widening of the superior mediastinum, could be due to fat deposition
 and/or adenopathy.
