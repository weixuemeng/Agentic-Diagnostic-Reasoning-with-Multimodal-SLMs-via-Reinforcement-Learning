                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with chemo and diarrhea  // infectious workup
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Correlation made to chest CT from ___ and chest x-ray
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes seen on the current exam.  There is a moderate left and small
 right pleural effusion, these are likely increased since prior CT.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is suggestion of
 superimposed vascular congestion with possible mild edema.  Right chest wall
 port is again noted.  Cardiac silhouette is grossly unchanged.  Multiple
 sclerotic foci are identified in the osseous structures including the proximal
 left humerus and likely of the scapula
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate left and small right pleural effusion, likely increased since prior
 CT.  Suspected superimposed vascular congestion with mild edema.  Underlying
 infection, particularly on the left, would be difficult to exclude.
