                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with abdominal pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the SVC/right atrial junction,
 unchanged.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  There has been interval development of a small left pleural
 effusion with patchy left lower lobe opacity, potentially compressive
 atelectasis, though infection is not excluded.  The right lung is grossly
 clear.  No pneumothorax is present.  There is no subdiaphragmatic free air. 
 Clips from prior cholecystectomy are noted in the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.  Known osseous metastatic disease is better seen on the previous CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe opacity, likely atelectasis,
 though infection is not excluded.  No subdiaphragmatic free air.
