                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with gastric CA presenting with fatigue and weakness
 // c/f PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates within the proximal right atrium.  The
 lungs are grossly clear without lobar consolidation, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Numerous dense osseous metastases are again
 visualized, including lesions seen anteriorly to the heart and projecting over
 the left upper lung, all of which are more discretely visualized on the
 patient's recent chest CT.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Known osseous metastatic disease is better
 evaluated by CT examination.
