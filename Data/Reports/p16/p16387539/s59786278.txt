 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p R MCA stroke after Dobhoff placement

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the prior radiograph from earlier the same date, a feeding tube

 of this radiograph.  With the exception of slight improved aeration at both
 lung bases, there is otherwise no relevant change since recent study.
