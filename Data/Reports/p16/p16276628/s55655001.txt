                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man intubated.  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal supine views of the chest were obtained portably for a
 total of six images. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  The
 endotracheal tube ends 7 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube follows the
 expected course ending below the diaphragm, although the tip is not
 visualized.  Pulmonary vasculature is indistinct, suggesting pulmonary edema.
 A left basilar opacity is probably a small left pleural effusion. No large
 pneumothorax or right effusion.  No displaced rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube ends 7 cm above the carina and could be advanced for
 more optimal position. 
 2.  Small left pleural effusion. 
 
 Preliminary findings discussed with Dr. ___ (ED) by phone at 3:04
 p.m., ___.
