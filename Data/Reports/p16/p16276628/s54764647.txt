                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with C6-7 spinal cord injury, assess lung fields.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-erect chest radiograph is obtained.  There is
 interval placement of cervical spinal fusion hardware.  Endotracheal tube ends
 2.2 cm above the carina and is unchanged.  Right IJ line terminates in the
 lower SVC.  The tip of NG tube is not visualized beyond mid esophagus.  Left
 pleural effusion has increased in size.  Mild pulmonary edema is stable.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate left pleural effusion has increased.
 2.  Tip of NG tube is not visualized beyond mid esophagus, which could be due
 to technical factors, but correlate with any history of withdrawal or repeat
 radiograph if confirmation of tip position is needed.
 3.  Stable mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis.
