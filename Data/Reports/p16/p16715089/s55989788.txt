                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath:  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are new interstitial opacities and vascular congestion, most
 consistent with mild pulmonary edema, although an atypical infection is a
 consideration.  A more focal consolidation at the medial right base may be
 related to the underlying abnormality, although focal atelectasis or
 developing consolidation is difficult to exclude.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart
 size is at the upper limits of normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New intersitial abnormality with a more focal opacity at the
 right base.  The etiology could be mild pulmonary edema with a slight
 asymmetric component or an atypical infection.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended.
