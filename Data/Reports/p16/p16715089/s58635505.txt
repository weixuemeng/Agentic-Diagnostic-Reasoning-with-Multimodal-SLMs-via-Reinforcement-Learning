                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  The patient is currently listed is EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob is calcified.  Perihilar
 haziness and vascular indistinctness is compatible with mild pulmonary edema. 
 More focal patchy opacity in the right lung base may reflect asymmetric
 pulmonary edema but an area of infection or aspiration is not excluded.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Contrast material is noted within
 the colon.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.  More focal patchy opacity in the right lung base may
 reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, but infection or aspiration is not
 excluded.  Continued followup after diuresis is recommended.
