                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary edema.  // Eval for volume overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP Chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild to moderate pulmonary edema. Diffuse hazy opacities at the lung
 bases bilaterally could reflect atelectasis. Evaluation of the cardiac
 silhouette is somewhat limited due to overlying opacities. However, there is
 probable mild cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax or focal consolidation identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggestive of heart failure which could be secondary to volume
 overload, among other causes.
