                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post MVC.  Evaluate ET tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube
 is within the stomach.  A left carotid endarterectomy stent is noted.
 
 There is no pneumothorax or left pleural effusion.  The right costophrenic
 angle is not imaged.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unremarkable. 
 Left retrocardiac opacity is better seen on the subsequent CT likely due to
 aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION: Satisfactory endotracheal tube position.
