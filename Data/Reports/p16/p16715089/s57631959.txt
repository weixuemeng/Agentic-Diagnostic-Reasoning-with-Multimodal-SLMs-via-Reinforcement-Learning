                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF p/w hypoxia, now s/p lasix  // evaluate
 for interval improvement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Evaluation of heart size is
 limited to the low lung volumes, AP projection, and bilateral airspace
 opacities. There is again seen a calcified thoracic aorta.
 
 There are again seen areas of diffuse bilateral airspace opacities. In
 particular, the right lower lobe appears better aerated, with improved
 visualization of right hemidiaphragm and right heart border. The left upper
 lobe is worse, and has developed more confluent areas of consolidation. This
 may reflect redistribution of pulmonary edema, or possibly overlying secondary
 process involving left upper lobe such aspiration or pneumonia.
 
 There is no pneumothorax or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved aeration of right lower lobe and worsening of consolidation involving
 left upper lobe, suggesting either redistribution of pulmonary edema due to
 change in patient positioning or overlying secondary process involving the
 left upper lobe such as pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis.
