                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough, nausea, and vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiograph is compared to prior radiograph dated
 ___. Relative to prior study, cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable. Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and opacity in the left lung
 base persists from prior examination though less conspicuous. Lungs appear
 hyperexpanded and diaphragms flattened suggestive of emphysematous changes. 
 There is a probable small left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. 
 There is possible minimal interstitial edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Relative to prior radiograph dated ___, there persists opacification
 at the left lung base, though less conspicuous and better aerated.  Developing
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Lungs are otherwise mildly hyperinflated to
 suggest emphysematous changes.
