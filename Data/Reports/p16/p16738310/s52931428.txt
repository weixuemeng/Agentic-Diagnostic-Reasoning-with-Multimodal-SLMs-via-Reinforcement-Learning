                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cholecystitis now with fever and
 increased oxygen requirements, here to evaluate for pulmonary pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs show decreased inspiratory
 lung volumes from ___.  There is increased opacification at the bilateral
 lung bases with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm on the left greater than the
 right consistent with small bilateral pleural effusions, better assessed on
 the corresponding lateral radiograph with underlying atelectasis.  However, in
 the correct clinical context, superimposed pneumonia should also be
 considered.  No pneumothorax is present.  The cardiac silhouette is
 incompletely assessed but overall unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with underlying atelectasis
 increased from ___.  In the correct clinical context, superimposed
 pneumonia should also be considered.
