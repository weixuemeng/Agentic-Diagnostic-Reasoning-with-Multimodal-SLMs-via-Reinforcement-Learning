 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:54 AM
  
  
  Right chest wall port catheter terminates at least in the lower SVC, however
  the inferior aspect of the catheter is obscured by the neoesophagus containing
  dense barium.  A radiopaque object is seen in the midline of the upper
  mediastinum, terminating at the level of the aortic arch, not definitely
  within the esophagus.  If this is a nasogastric tube, it should be removed and
  replaced.  Barium is seen within loops of small bowel and contrast is seen
  within the renal collecting systems from recent CT scan.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with esophageal cancer s/p MIE, now with n/v  //
 Eval NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA
 
 COMPARISON:   Chest CT dated ___ and chest radiograph dated ___ at 12:04
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lines and Tubes: There is a right-sided port with tip terminating at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Enteric tube terminates in the upper mediastinum, likely
 within the proximal new esophagus.
 
 Lungs: Well inflated with right lower lobe linear opacities likely
 atelectasis.  The right costophrenic angle has not been included on this
 radiograph.
 
 Pleura: No pneumothorax.  No left pleural effusion.  Right costophrenic angle
 has been excluded.
 
 Mediastinum: No cardiomegaly.  There is retained barium within the neo-
 esophagus projecting over the right.  Barium is noted to trickle into the
 bowel loops in the upper abdomen.  Partially visualized is contrast within
 bilateral renal collecting systems from the recent CT with intravenous
 contrast.
 
 Bony thorax: No significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Newly placed enteric tube tip projects over the upper mediastinum, likely
 terminates in the proximal neo- esophagus, and may be advanced distally.
 
 Note:  There is a subsequent radiograph dated ___ at 04:44 that
 demonstrates advancement of the enteric tube with the tip terminating in the
 mid neo esophagus.
