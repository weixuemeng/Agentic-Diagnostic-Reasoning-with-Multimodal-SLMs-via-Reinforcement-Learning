 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded.  A right chest wall port catheter tip terminates
 in the distal SVC.  Subtle opacity in the right lower lobe only seen on the
 frontal projection may represent atelectasis however early infection is also
 possible.  There is no  pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but unchanged since prior studies.
 The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. Right acromioclavicular arthropathy
 is again noted.  Otherwise bones are unchanged.

 Subtle right lower lobe opacity may represent atelectasis however early
 pneumonia is also possible.  Stable cardiomegaly.
