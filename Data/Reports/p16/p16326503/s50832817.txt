                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia or
 aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right Port-A-Cath ends in the approximate region of the cavoatrial
 junction, unchanged.  Focal opacity in the right lateral lung base is slightly
 less conspicuous on today's exam compared to ___.  A small right pleural
 effusion is persistent.  Ill-defined opacities in the periphery of the left
 lung suggests chronic multifocal aspiration, similar to the prior exam.  No
 pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size.  Distended neoesophagus is overall
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight improvement in peripheral right basilar opacity and persistent poorly
 defined peripheral left lung opacities, most likely due to multifocal
 aspiration/ aspiration pneumonia.
