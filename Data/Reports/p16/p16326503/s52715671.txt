                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aspiration events a couple of days ago with
 productive cough  // pna?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___ min best midnight
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, there is new hazy opacity at the right lung base. 
 Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle could be very slightly more
 pronounced than on the prior film.  Minimal blunting of left costophrenic
 angle is unchanged.  Left base atelectasis is also unchanged.  No CHF.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours, which apparently include changes related to
 esophagectomy are grossly unchanged.  Right-sided indwelling catheter again
 noted.  No pneumothorax detected.  With slight blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle which is slightly more
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly hazy opacity at the right lung base which is new compared with the
 prior study.  Based on this image, it is difficult to determine whether this
 is caused by layering pleural fluid or whether there is a component of focal
 parenchymal opacity to suggest pulmonary infiltrate or aspiration pneumonitis.
 Layering pleural fluid is considered more likely.
