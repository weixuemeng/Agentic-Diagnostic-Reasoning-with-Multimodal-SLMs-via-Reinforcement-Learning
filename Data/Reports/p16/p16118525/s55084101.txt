                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with temperature of 102; rule out pneumonia or
 atelectasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a left upper lobe 7 mm opacity.  The remaining of the lungs are
 unremarkable.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  There is no evidence of pneumonia or atelectasis.
 2.  7 mm left upper lobe nodularity is of indeterminate localization and
 etiology.  A standard PA and lateral chest radiography is suggested.
