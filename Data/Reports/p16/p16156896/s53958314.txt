                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with fall and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 8:09 a.m. from___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is no
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Blunting of the left posterior
 costophrenic sulcus may represent a tiny pleural effusion or scarring. 
 Prominent diffuse interstitial markings suggest underlying chronic lung
 disease.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  Degenerative changes seen in the shoulders
 bilaterally.  No displaced rib fracture is identified. A wedge compression
 deformity in the lower thoracic/upper lumbar spine is of unknown chronicity. 
 Aortic calcifications are better seen on the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. No acute intrathoracic process.
 2. Wedge compression deformity in the lower thoracic/upper lumbar spine of
 unknown chronicity. Correlate with exam.
