 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute onset shortness of breath, wheezing
 and cough productive of sputum  // Pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there are new right lateral rib
 fractures.  The old pre-existing healed rib fractures are constant in
 appearance.  The lung volumes have decreased. There is no convincing evidence
 for the presence of a pneumothorax.  Minimal atelectasis at the lung bases. 
 No cardiomegaly.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumonia.
