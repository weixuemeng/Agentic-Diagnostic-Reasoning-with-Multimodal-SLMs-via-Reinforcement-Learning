                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with shortness of breath, decreased oxygen
 saturation and diffuse rhonchi on exam. (Has known right rib fractures from
 unknown trauma)  // Developing pneumonia? Aspiration?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previously seen infrahilar peribronchial opacities appear slightly more
 prominent, either due to low lung volumes, possibly from splinting due to the
 new right-sided rib fractures, or due to incipient pneumonia. If there is no
 resolution in ___ weeks, would recommend CT for further evaluation. There is
 no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Slightly more prominent peribronchial opacities, either due to low lung
 volumes or possibly incipient pneumonia. If there is no resolution within 1- 2
 weeks, would recommend CT for further evaluation.
