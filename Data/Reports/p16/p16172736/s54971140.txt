 // high oxygen requirement?      high oxygen requirement?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is more
 prominent and there is further engorgement of pulmonary vessels, consistent
 with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  The left hemidiaphragm is obscured
 consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion.  Similar
 but less prominent changes are seen at the right base.  Suggestion of an area
 of increased opacification in the left mid lung, though this could primarily
 be related to the overlying scapula.
