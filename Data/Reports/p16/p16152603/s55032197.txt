                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post right lower lobectomy with postoperative
 bleeding, evaluate given recent surgery.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to most recent chest x-ray from ___, there has been
 interval removal of left IJ central venous catheter.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are stable and within normal limits.  The right hilum is somewhat
 obscured, however the left hilum is within normal limits.  Lateralization of
 the apex of the right hemidiaphragm suggests a small right subpulmonic pleural
 effusion, not appreciably changed in comparison to ___.  There
 appears to be fluid tracking into the right minor fissure.  Opacity involving
 the right lower lung likely represents secondary relaxation atelectasis of the
 right middle lobe, and appears improved in comparison to ___. 
 Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or
 focal lung consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent small right subpulmonic pleural effusion with adjacent right
 middle lobe relaxation atelectasis, mildly improved in comparison to ___.
 2. No pneumothorax.
