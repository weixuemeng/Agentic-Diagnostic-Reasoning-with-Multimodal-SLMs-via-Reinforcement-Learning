                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, history of aortic valve replacement and thoracic
 aneurysm.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The
 patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.  There
 is massive dilatation of the entire thoracic aorta, compatible with known
 thoracic aortic dissection and aneurysmal dilatation as seen on the prior CTA.
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal and the lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  The
 lungs appear mildly hyperinflated with relative lucency at the lung apices,
 compatible with known paraseptal emphysema.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 are seen.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged massive dilatation of the entire thoracic aorta
 compatible with known aneurysm and Type A dissection.  No radiographic
 evidence for pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
