                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman intubated, w/prior RLL mucus plugging (improved
 on ___ am CXR), but now with worsening hypoxia in past ___ min  // please
 assess for mucus plugging
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:33
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, no definite change is detected.
 
 Again seen are patchy opacities at both lung bases, possibly minimally worse
 at the left lung with base laterally.  Allowing for this, no new areas of
 opacity are identified.
 
 Mild vascular plethora appears slightly improved.
 
 Possible small pleural effusions, not significantly changed.
 
 Right IJ line, tip over distal SVC , again noted.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Slight improvement in vascular plethora.
 2. Possible minimal increased opacity at the lateral edge of the previously
 seen left base patchy opacity.
 3. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 4. Right base patchy opacity remains present.
