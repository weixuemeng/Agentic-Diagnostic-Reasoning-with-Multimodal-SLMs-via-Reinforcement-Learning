                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman intubated w/recurrent mucus plugging  // assess
 position of ETT, any worsening RLL consoldiaiton?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 06:47
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.4 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm to overlie the expected site of
 the gastric fundus.  Right IJ central line tip overlies the distal SVC.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged, allowing for technical
 differences.  The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated compared to the left. 
 There is mild vascular plethora and slight blurring, which is probably not
 significantly changed allowing for technique.  There is subsegmental
 atelectasis at the left and right bases, similar to the prior study.  Probable
 small left effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Appearance is overall similar to the prior study, with mild vascular plethora,
 bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis, and small left pleural effusion.  No
 evidence for interval worsening of the right lower lobe opacity.
