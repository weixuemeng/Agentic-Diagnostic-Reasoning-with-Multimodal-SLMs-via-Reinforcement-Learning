 INDICATION:  History: ___M with afib on coumadin w/ acute change in gait.  //
 acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiomediastinal silhouette, however mild
 cardiomegaly has slightly increased in size compared to the prior exam from ___. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion otherwise the hilar and
 mediastinal contours are normal. There is a retrocardiac opacity with
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  Median sternotomy wires and mitral
 valve replacement are unchanged in appearance. Calcification is noted in the
 descending aorta. Degenerative changes are seen in the acromioclavicular
 joints bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of left hemidiaphragm may be
 secondary to atelectasis, however left lower lobe pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.
 
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
