                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___ with possible fall, dizziness, evaluate for pneumonia and rib
 fractures..
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___
 TECHNIQUE
 PA and lateral view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low which accentuates the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is top normal in size.   There is a retrocardiac
 opacity with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  The right lung is grossly
 clear. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Median sternotomy
 wire and mitral valve replacement are unchanged in appearance. Calcification
 is noted in the descending aorta. Degenerative changes are noted about the
 acromioclavicular joints bilaterally. There is no definite rib fracture
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm could
 represent atelectasis or left lower lobe pneumonia in the correct clinical
 setting.
