 Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy or obvious pulmonary nodule is detected.  Incidental note is
 made of eventration of the right hemidiaphragm.  Mild degenerative changes of
 the thoracic spine are noted.

 Equivocal mild cardiomegaly.  No acute pulmonary process identified.  No
 radiographic evidence of sarcoidosis detected.

 lymphadenopathy or pulmonary nodules.
