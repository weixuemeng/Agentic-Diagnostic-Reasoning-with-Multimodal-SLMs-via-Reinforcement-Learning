                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Feeling not well, fatigue.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.  Chest radiograph ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged with a left ventricular
 predominance.  The aorta is tortuous and mildly calcified, unchanged. 
 Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries is stable, compatible with underlying
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Minimal streaky opacity in the retrocardiac
 region likely reflects atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.  No large
 pleural effusion is present.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary vascular congestion
 is visualized.  Right humeral head prosthesis is noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal retrocardiac streaky opacity likely reflecting atelectasis but
 infection is not excluded.
