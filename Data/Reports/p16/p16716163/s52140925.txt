                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Head trauma with intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal
 tube tip lies approximately 5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube extends
 to the distal stomach. No vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  The area
 of subtle opacity projecting over the right upper lung is difficult to
 demonstrate on the current study.
