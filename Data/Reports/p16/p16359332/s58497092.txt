 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP semi- upright and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Elevated right hemidiaphragm again noted. The heart is markedly enlarged with
 splaying of the carinal suggesting left atrial enlargement. Given lack of
 prior imaging studies, difficult to assess the the of the cardiac enlargement
 and clinical correlation for possibility of pericardial effusion advised. No
 large effusion or pneumothorax. No convincing signs of pneumonia or edema. The
 mediastinum appears well-defined and mildly prominent likely reflecting a
 ectatic vasculature. The bony structures are diffusely demineralized with high
 riding humeral heads noted bilaterally.

 Marked cardiomegaly. Please correlate clinically for chronicity and
 possibility of pericardial effusion. No evidence of pneumonia.
