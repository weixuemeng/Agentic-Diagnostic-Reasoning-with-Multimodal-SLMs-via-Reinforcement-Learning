                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever and aspiration  // worsening pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube terminates in the mid trachea.  A nasogastric tube courses into
 the stomach, distal tip not visualized.  A right PICC line terminates in the
 upper right atrium.  Bilateral airspace opacities have increased on the left
 and at the right base.  Small layering pleural effusion and basilar
 subsegmental atelectasis are stable.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 magnified by the projection but stable.  Gaseous distention of the stomach has
 increased despite the presence of a nasogastric tube.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased bilateral airspace opacities may be due to worsening pulmonary
 edema, or new aspiration/infection.  Increased gaseous distention of the
 stomach may increase the risk of aspiration.
 
 
 Stable small left pleural effusions with bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 16:03 into the Department of Radiology critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
