 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with concern for infection  // opacity
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral parenchymal opacities,
 notably on the left, have moderately increased, emphasize inter suspicion for
 pneumonia.  In addition, there is an increase in diameter of the vascular
 structures and an increase in interstitial markings, likely reflecting a
 component of pulmonary edema.  Bilateral blunting of the costophrenic sinuses,
 likely reflecting pleural effusion.  The monitoring and support devices are in
 constant position.
