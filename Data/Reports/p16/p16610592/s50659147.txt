 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes with
 increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding.

 There are likely unchanged bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is
 identified. A right PICC again terminates within the upper right atrium.  The
 patient has been extubated, with mild narrowing of the superior trachea.

 1. Mild narrowing of the superior trachea. Further evaluation with dedicated
 soft tissue neck radiographs is recommended.
 2. Lower lung volumes, with persistent bilateral opacities consistent with
 pulmonary edema. Likely unchanged bilateral pleural effusions.
