                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with paroxysmal Afib, recent pneumonia, recent cardioversion,
 now returns with Afib  // evaluate for interval change, pneumonia, CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 Chest radiograph dated ___.
 CTA chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Although increased interstitial markings have been present on remote
 radiographs, they have also mildly increased since recent prior suggesting
 component of superimposed interstitial edema.  Bilateral parenchymal opacities
 are more conspicuous, especially in the right mid lung. There are bilateral
 pleural effusions, trace on the right, mild on the left.
 
 Right shoulder arthroplasty is partially imaged.  Right deviation of the
 trachea is unchanged and presumably due to goiter as seen on chest CT dated ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased interstitial markings likely due to interstitial edema,
 potentially superimposed on a chronic interstitial process.
 2. Bilateral, right greater than left parenchymal opacities, concerning for
 superimposed infection.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat radiograph after treatment to document resolution.
