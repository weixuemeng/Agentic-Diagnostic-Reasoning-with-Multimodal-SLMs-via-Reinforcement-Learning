                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, recent pneumonia diagnosis
 // Assess for evolving infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Rightward tracheal
 deviation at the thoracic inlet due to a left-sided masses compatible with
 known thyroid goiter, unchanged.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 interstitial pulmonary edema appear slightly worse in the interval. 
 Ill-defined perihilar opacities are are not substantially changed in the
 interval.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are also similar in size.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Patient is status post right shoulder
 arthroplasty.  Multiple remote bilateral rib fractures are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema, slightly worse in the interval with persistent small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 2. Perihilar ill-defined opacities bilaterally are unchanged.  As noted
 previously, these could reflect multifocal pneumonia or be associated with
 underlying chronic rib fractures and continued imaging followup after
 treatment is again recommended.
