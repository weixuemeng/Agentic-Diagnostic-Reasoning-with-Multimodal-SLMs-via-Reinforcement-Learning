                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with URI symptoms x5-6 days and SOB
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lungs appear lucent and
 hyperinflated consistent with COPD.  There are small bilateral effusions with
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion and likely mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  There are subtle nodular foci within the right mid lung which are
 indeterminate and recommend followup post diuresis to exclude underlying
 lesion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Right humeral head
 prosthesis noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild edema and small pleural effusions with areas of nodular opacity in the
 right mid to lower lung for which post diuresis films would be helpful to
 exclude underlying lesion.
