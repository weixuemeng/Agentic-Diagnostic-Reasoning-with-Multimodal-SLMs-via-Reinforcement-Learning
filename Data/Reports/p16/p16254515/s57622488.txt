                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with ___'s and dyspnea, recent
 nasal congestion, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  No typical configurational
 abnormality is identified.  Thoracic aorta is moderately widened and shows
 calcium deposits in the wall, mostly at the level of the arch.  No local
 contour abnormalities are identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  The diaphragms are relatively low positioned and flattened, a
 finding which in conjunction with the irregular distribution of the pulmonary
 peripheral vasculature is indicative of COPD.  Acute parenchymal infiltrates,
 however, cannot be identified.  Also, the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.  There is evidence of at least
 two rib deformities in the right hemithorax related to the fourth, fifth and
 sixth ribs in the posterior lateral circumference and most likely representing
 old healed rib fractures.  The lateral chest view discloses an accentuated
 kyphotic curvature in the thoracic spine with moderate degree of degenerative
 changes, but no conclusive evidence of any vertebral body compression
 fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings in comparison with previous chest
 examinations of ___ and ___.  There is no evidence of
 acute pulmonary infiltrates or acute pulmonary congestion.
