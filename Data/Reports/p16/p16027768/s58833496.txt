 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and chronic obstructive asthma, assess for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are mildly
 hyperexpanded but clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 heart is normal in size with normal mediastinal and hilar contours. Rounded
 posteromedial opacities in both bases may reflect Bochdalek type herniae or
 diaphragmatic eventration.
