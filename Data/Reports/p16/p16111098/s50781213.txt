                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Asbestos exposure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again, the vague opacification overlying a portion of the right lung
 most likely represents a pleural plaque in view of the clinical history.  No
 evidence of calcification of the diaphragmatic pleura.
 
 No pneumonia or vascular congestion.
