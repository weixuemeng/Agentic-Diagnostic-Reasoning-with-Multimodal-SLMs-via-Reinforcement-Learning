                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New hypoxemia.  Evaluate for consolidation or effusion.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low.  There is evidence of left lower lobe atelectasis
 and a small pleural effusion seen in the posterior costophrenic angle on the
 lateral view.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis and a small posterior pleural effusion.  If
 hypoxemia persists, pulmonary embolism should be considered as a possible
 etiology.
