   ET tube 5.7 cm above the carina, but is still likely within the thoracic
  inlet on this lordotic film.  The Dobbhoff tube is again noted to be directed
  cephalad within the stomach.  Opacities at the left lung base again are
  thought to reflect atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hepatic encephalopathy with intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of an endotracheal tube.  The tip lies above the clavicles,
 approximately 5.7 cm above the carina.  There are lower lung volumes with a
 mildly elevated left hemidiaphragm.  Atelectatic changes at the left base are
 seen.
 
 The Dobbhoff tube again extends to the upper stomach, with the tube coiling on
 itself so the metallic tip lies just beneath the left hemidiaphragm.
