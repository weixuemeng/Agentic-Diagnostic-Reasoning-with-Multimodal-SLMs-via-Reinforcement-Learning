                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with HCV cirrhosis with altered mental status, evaluation
 for interval changes, infectious causes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient has been extubated.  Dobbhoff tube still curves in the stomach. 
 Minimal cardiac congestion is unchanged.  Small new left lung base opacity is
 nonspecific, could either be small pleural effusion or atelectasis, but
 superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Known hiatal hernia.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Unchanged mild cardiac congestion.
 2.  New very small opacification of the left lung base is nonspecific, could
 reflect atelectasis and small pleural effusion.  Aspiration or infection
 cannot be excluded in appropriate clinical setting.
