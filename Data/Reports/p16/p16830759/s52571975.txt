 terminates 3.4 cm above the carina, likely due to chin positioning. A right IJ
 central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC, unchanged in position.
 There has been interval improvement of pulmonary vascular congestion. The
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Retrocardiac opacity and mild right base
 atelectasis have slightly improved. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Enteric tube coils within the expected location of the cervical
