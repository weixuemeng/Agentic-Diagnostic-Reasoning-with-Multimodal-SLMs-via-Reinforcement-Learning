  Lung volumes are low.  Left lower lobe opacities are presumably atelectasis
  and are unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pre-operative possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes.  Increased opacifications at the left base with blunting of the
 costophrenic angles could well represent post-operative atelectasis and small
 pleural effusions.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  The enteric tube remains in
 place.
