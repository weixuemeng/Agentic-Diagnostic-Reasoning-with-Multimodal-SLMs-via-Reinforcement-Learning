                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, unclear baseline on Coumadin. Evaluate for an
 acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: The lung volumes are low.  There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  The cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged.  There is prominence of the right paratracheal stripe.
 
 IMPRESSION: Prominence the right paratracheal stripe may be vascular in
 etiology, although, lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded.  A nonemergent CT
 would provide better characterization.
