                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Metastatic breast cancer, rule out pulmonary mets or
 pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT from ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal shift to the left is unchanged, most likely
 due to the presence of pleural effusion.  No appreciable change in the
 appearance of the left hemithorax is noted.  Bilateral breast prostheses are
 noted.  No definitive new pulmonary nodules are seen within the limitations of
 the sensitivity of chest radiograph.
