 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress, evaluation for pneumothorax or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Moderate cardiomegaly, left retrocardiac atelectasis.  No overt
 pulmonary edema.  The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be
 excluded, given the blunting of the left costophrenic sinus.  No evidence of
 pneumonia, no interval appearance of new parenchymal changes.  The right PICC
 line and the nasogastric tube are constant in position.
