 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. The hila are slightly less
 prominent as compared to the prior study, suggesting improving vascular
 congestion.  There is a new opacification in the left upper lobe, which may
 represent atelectasis or aspiration. The cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The endotracheal tube
 and 2.4 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 2.  Endotracheal tube ends 2.4 cm from the carina.
 3.  New opacification in the left upper lobe may represent atelectasis or
 aspiration.
