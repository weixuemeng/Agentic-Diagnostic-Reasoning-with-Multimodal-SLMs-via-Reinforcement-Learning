 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:24 PM
  NG tube below the diaphragm, at least within the stomach, though tip
  incompletely imaged.  Large bore left subclavian catheter in the right atrium
  - unchanged.  VP shunt in unchanged position.  Bibasilar consolidations
  persist though with improved aeration of the right lung base.  Stable mild
  cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax. ___ p_________________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure disorder, aphasia, status post stroke, new NG tube
 placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.  
 
 Compared with ___, an NG tube has been placed.  The tip extends beneath
 the diaphragm off the film.   Again seen is a dual-lumen catheter overlying
 the right atrium.  An additional catheter coursing vertically across the right
 chest could represent a VP shunt.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Asymmetric hazy opacity over
 the left lung may represent either pleural fluid or atelectasis.  There is
 increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  The right lung is grossly clear, except for minimal
 atelectasis at the right base.  No gross right effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  NG tube tip extends beneath diaphragm, off film.
