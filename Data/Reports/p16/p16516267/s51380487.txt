                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 238 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with polycystic kidneys, status post
 transplant and with seizure disorder, presents with difficult to control
 seizures, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 239 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3 cm above the
 carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 not identified.  A portion of the right sided ventriculoperitoneal shunt is
 visualized.  A right subclavian PICC line remains in place with its tip in the
 proximal SVC.
 
 2.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given marked patient
 rotation to the right on the current examination.  There now appear to be some
 streaky linear opacities at the medial left lung base, which could reflect
 atelectasis, although aspiration or early pneumonia should also be considered.
 No evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
