 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of seizure has VP shunt,
 status post renal transplant on ___, now with febrile neutropenia, viral
 urinary tract infection and CMV viremia, now with repeat fever spike. 
 Evaluate for evidence of consolidation - aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in

 similar study of ___.  Previously described left internal
 jugular approach wide-bore dialysis catheter remains in unchanged position
 terminating within the right atrium.  Unchanged is also the position of the VP
 shunt.  No pneumothorax has developed.  Previously described bilateral basal
 densities persist and are indicative of pleural effusions, more marked on the
 right than the left.  There is no evidence of new discrete pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates in comparison with the previous portable chest
 examination.
