                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Right-sided chest pain and subjective fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged, unchanged since the prior study.  Lung volumes are
 low, but lungs are clear.  Prominence of the main pulmonary artery that might
 potentially reflect pulmonary hypertension is re-demonstrated.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
