                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent prolonged hospitalization for ARDS
 now with persistent O2 requirement  // eval lung parenchyma     eval lung
 parenchyma
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  There are diffuse areas of reticulonodular and alveolar
 opacification throughout both lungs.  In view of the clinical history, this
 could well represent a recurrence of ARDS.
 The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no evidence of
 pleural effusion, findings that make pulmonary edema a much less likely.
