                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with endocarditis, acute SOB, crackles on L side,
 new oxygen requirement  // r/o pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright view.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal and stable.  Increasing
 hilar fullness and increasing bilateral opacities suggest pulmonary vascular
 congestion and increasing pulmonary edema.  A more confluent area of opacity
 at the left base may represent atelectasis or infection in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Multiple
 granulomas are stable in the right lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.  Confluent area of opacity at the base of the left lung
 could represent infection in the appropriate setting.
