                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with new right IJ placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable semi-erect frontal view of the chest was
 obtained.  An endotracheal tube is approximately 3 cm above the carina.  The
 enteric tube is within the stomach.  A right central venous (IJ) catheter
 terminates in the right atrium.  Prominent streaky opacifications in the left
 and right bases could reflect atelectasis or aspiration.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear.  There is no large pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Appropriate placement of all support devices.
 2.  Increased density at both bases may reflect atelectasis or aspiration.
