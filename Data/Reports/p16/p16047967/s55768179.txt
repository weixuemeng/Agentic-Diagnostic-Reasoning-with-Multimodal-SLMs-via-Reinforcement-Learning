                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypertension.  Question cardiomegaly.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Low lung volumes are again noted with crowding of
 the pulmonary vascular markings.  There is no evidence of confluent
 consolidation or effusion.  The cardiac silhouette appears slightly enlarged,
 but this is likely accentuated due to low inspiratory effort.  This is
 unchanged from prior exam.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Prominent
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated due to low lung volumes.
