                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizures status post intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is slightly low lying measuring approximately 2.9 cm
 from the carina.  An orogastric tube tip is within the stomach as is the side
 port.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  No pulmonary edema is seen.  Streaky bibasilar airspace
 opacities could reflect atelectasis but aspiration cannot be excluded.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality
 seen. Cervical spinal fusion hardware is partially imaged. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.9 cm from the carina, slightly
 low lying, and an orogastric tube is within the stomach.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities could reflect atelectasis or aspiration.
