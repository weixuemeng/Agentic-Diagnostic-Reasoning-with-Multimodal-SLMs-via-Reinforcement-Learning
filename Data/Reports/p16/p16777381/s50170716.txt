                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 402
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CAD, CHF, and COPD with recent ischemic
 colitis, now post-op with intermittent tachyarrhythmia, question sepsis,
 assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is to patient's prior study of ___ at 904.
 
 A portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 402 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The patient is markedly rotated on the current examination.  The
 endotracheal tube has its tip 4.4 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is
 seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  A right
 internal jugular central line is unchanged in position with its tip in the
 proximal to mid SVC.  
 
 2. There is worsening bilateral airspace process, likely pulmonary edema with
 increasing consolidation at the left base likely reflecting compressive
 atelectasis in the setting of a pleural effusion.  A smaller right effusion is
 also likely evident.  A right-sided dual-lead pacer remains in place with its
 leads terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right
 ventricle respectively.  No pneumothorax appreciated.  Heart remains enlarged.
