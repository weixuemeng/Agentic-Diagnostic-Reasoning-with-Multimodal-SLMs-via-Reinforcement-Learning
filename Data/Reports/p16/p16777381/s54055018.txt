                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with coronary artery disease, congestive
 cardiac failure and pacemaker status post subtotal colectomy with ileostomy
 with resolving sepsis.  Evaluate nasogastric tube which has been pulled back.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 03:31.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A right-sided dual-lead pacemaker device is
 noted with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle in appropriate
 position. Right IJ catheter is looped in the right IJ, unchanged from the
 prior radiograph but with tip in the expected region of the upper SVC. 
 Nasogastric tube is noted to pass below the diaphragm with side port within
 the expected region of the stomach.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild pulmonary
 edema has improved since most recent prior examination.   Stable left lower
 lobe opacity may represent pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. 
 Minimal opacification in the right lower lobe is unchanged from the prior
 examination.
