                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, history of cancer, DVT, evaluate for
 pneumonia or fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___ and
 recent CT chest on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is no focal
 consolidation, vascular congestion or pneumothorax.  Hazy opacity over the
 left lower lung laterally.  In addition, there is a somewhat 1.9 cm more focal
 rounded opacity over the left lower lung on the frontal view only, that was
 not seen on prior chest radiographs or recent chest CT.  The cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are normal. Old right rib fractures noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:   Nodular opacity projecting over the left lower lung measuring
 1.9 cm that was not seen on prior chest radiographs or recent chest CT.  This
 may represent a loculated pleural fluid given recent pleural effusions and
 hazy opacity over the left lower lung laterally, however, pulmonary nodule
 cannot be ruled out.  Oblique views or non-emergent CT can be done to further
 evaluate this area.
