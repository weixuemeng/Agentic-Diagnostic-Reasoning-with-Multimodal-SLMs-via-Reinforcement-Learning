                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-through with
 multiple clips re- demonstrated in the mediastinum.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath
 tip terminates within the SVC.  The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Streaky opacity in the left
 lower lobe appears slightly worse when compared to the previous radiograph,
 and could reflect an area of atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded.  Right lung is clear.  There is a trace right pleural effusion.  No
 pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated.  No pneumothorax is present. 
 Old right-sided rib deformities are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky left lower lobe opacity could reflect atelectasis but infection or
 aspiration cannot excluded, and findings appear slightly worse compared to the
 previous chest radiograph.  Trace right pleural effusion.
