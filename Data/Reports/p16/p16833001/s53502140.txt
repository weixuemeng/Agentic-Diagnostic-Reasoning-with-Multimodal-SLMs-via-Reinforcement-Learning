                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with male syncope.  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal lateral views of the chest.  Linear opacity at the left lung base is
 compatible with scarring.  Additional retrocardiac opacity seen and could be
 due to atelectasis or scarring as well.  The lungs are otherwise clear of
 consolidation or effusion.  Surgical clips again noted in the mediastinum. 
 Posttraumatic changes seen along the right chest wall.  Hypertrophic changes
 noted in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Left lung base opacities in part
 due to scarring and likely atelectasis, noting superimposd infection is not
 completely excluded.
