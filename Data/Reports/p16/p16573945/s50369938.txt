                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in
 the body of the right atrium.  Lung volumes are slightly improved compared to
 the prior study.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for this
 factor.  Improved aeration is present at both lung bases with residual
 bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis remaining, predominantly in the
 retrocardiac regions.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are also
 demonstrated, left greater than right.
