                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous chest
 x-ray from ___.  Linear opacity in the right mid lung is suggestive
 of scarring.  Increased interstitial markings are seen throughout the lungs
 including the left upper lung and lung bases.  Increased density in
 retrocardiac region is compatible with moderate hiatal hernia.  No large
 effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.  Dense
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the arch.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of right mid lung scarring.  Increased
 interstitial markings particularly at the bases, potentially due to chronic
 lung disease; however, component of active inflammation is also possible.
