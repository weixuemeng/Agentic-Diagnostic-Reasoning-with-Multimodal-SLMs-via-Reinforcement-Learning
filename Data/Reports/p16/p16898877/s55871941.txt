                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:57 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a right foot infection.  Preop.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging:
 
 Heart size is top normal, lungs are clear.  Fullness in the mediastinum just
 above the level of the carina could be due to vascular engorgement,
 mediastinal fat deposition, or even lymph node enlargement.  Any prior chest
 radiographs would be helpful to review to see if this is a new finding
 warranting further investigation.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion. 
 Hardware denotes prior cervical spine surgery and fixation.
