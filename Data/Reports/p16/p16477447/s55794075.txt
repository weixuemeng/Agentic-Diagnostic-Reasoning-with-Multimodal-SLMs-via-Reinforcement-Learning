                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of metastatic cancer with
 pleuritic chest pain for the past one to two weeks.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  A left-sided
 Port-A-Cath is again seen, terminating at the distal SVC/cavoatrial junction. 
 In the interval since the prior study, there has been development of left base
 opacity seen to represent combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis on
 subsequent CT along with worsening metastatic disease.  At the lateral left
 lung base, there is a rounded 2.3 x 1.7 cm opacity concerning for additional
 pulmonary metastasis.  Minimal right base opacity most likely represents
 atelectasis.  There are multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, better assessed
 on CT.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left base opacity corresponds to moderate left pleural effusion with
 overlying atelectasis seen on subsequent chest CT.  Rounded opacity at the
 lateral left base is worrisome for worsening metastasis.  Bilateral pulmonary
 nodules, better assessed on CT.
