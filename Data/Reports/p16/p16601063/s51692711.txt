                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

 requirement  // pls eval for infiltrate, opacity      pls eval for infiltrate,
 opacity
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes have improved and earlier mild interstitial edema has resolved. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Widening of the mediastinum at
 the level of the aortic arch is stable, could be a function of supine
 positioning, mediastinal fat deposition and low lung volumes.  When feasible,
 up right conventional chest radiographic view should be obtained. Read if
 clinical history and findings are consistent with mediastinal injury, I would
 recommend chest CTA to look for vascular injury causing hematoma.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___ by telephone on
 ___ at 2:12 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
