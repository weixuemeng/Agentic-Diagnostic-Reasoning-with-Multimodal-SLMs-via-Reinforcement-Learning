 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is demonstrated, slightly more
 pronounced than on the prior study.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Streaky atelectasis is noted
 in the retrocardiac region.  Small left pleural effusion is noted.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are mild degenerative changes in the
