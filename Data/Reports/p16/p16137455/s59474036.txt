                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Dyspnea in a patient with HIV.
 
 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there is interval development of bilateral perihilar
 opacities with interstitial nature, with perihilar and basal predominance,
 with evidence of Kerley B lines.  There is also interval development of new
 small bilateral pleural effusion including the fissural fluid.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged including mild cardiomegaly.  Note is
 made of the prominence of the azygos vein, new.  Overall, described findings
 are most likely consistent with interval development of pulmonary edema. 
 Pneumonia is less likely but cannot be excluded.  Evaluation of the patient
 after diuresis to exclude the possibility of underlying infectious process,
 for example such as pneumocystis pneumonia is recommended.
