                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of hypoxia, wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy.  There is right greater than left perihilar
 opacity and right base patchy opacity.  Given reported history of fever and
 hypoxia, findings are worrisome for multifocal infectious process, possibly
 superimposed on mild edema, although given clinical history, this is felt much
 less likely.  There is minimal lingular and linear atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. 
 The mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral right greater than left pulmonary airspace opacities
 concerning for multifocal infectious process.  In a patient with HIV, PCP
 would not be excluded and in the differential depending on CD4 count;
 recommend correlation with CD4 count.
