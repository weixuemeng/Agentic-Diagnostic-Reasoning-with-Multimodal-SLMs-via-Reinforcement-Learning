                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiographs were obtained.  The central pulmonary
 vasculature is slightly more pronounced compared with the prior exam in ___.
 Linear opacities at the right base are most compatible with atelectasis.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is no new consolidation, effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A rim calcified lesion in the right upper quadrant is
 compatible with previously seen calcified liver cyst.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature is
 compatible with pulmonary venous hypertension.  No overt pulmonary edema or
 other acute cardiopulmonary process.
