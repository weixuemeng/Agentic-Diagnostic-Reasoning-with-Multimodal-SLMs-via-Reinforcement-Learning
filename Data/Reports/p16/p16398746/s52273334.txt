  The patient is status post median sternotomy with wires intact.  Lung volumes
  are low.  An opacity at the right lung base is consistent with platelike
  atelectasis, however superimposed infection can't cannot be excluded. 
  Platelike atelectasis in the left mid lung is unchanged.  There is no
  pneumothorax.  No evidence of free intraperitoneal air.  Rounded calcific
  density projecting over the liver is unchanged from CT abdomen ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HIV and acute onset of severe abdominal
 pain.  // Please evaluate for perforation.      Please evaluate for
 perforation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, there again are low lung volumes that
 accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  The area of increased
 opacification at the right base is slightly more prominent.  Although this
 could merely represent dense atelectatic changes, in the appropriate clinical
 setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
 No definite evidence of pneumoperitoneum, though this cannot be excluded in
 the absence of an upright view or CT.  The calcified lesion in the liver is
 unchanged.
