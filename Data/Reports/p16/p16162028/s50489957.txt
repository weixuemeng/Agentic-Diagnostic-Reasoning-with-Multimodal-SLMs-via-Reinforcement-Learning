                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall and mid scapular pain, question fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The exam is limited due the patient's body habitus as well as
 language barrier.
 
 The limited exams demonstrate cardiomegaly and increased vasculature
 bilaterally, particularly on the left, worrisome for asymmetric pulmonary
 edema.  Consolidation is difficult to rule out.  There is no large pleural
 effusion.  In the very limited views of the film, there is an acute-appearing
 at least fifth but also likely ___-___ right posterior rib fractures without
 visaulized pneumothorax.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Acute right posterior fifth and potentially ___- 7th rib fractures without
 underlying pneumothorax.
 2.  Limited evaluation of the lungs demonstrates probable asymmetric left
 greater than right pulmonary edema without pleural effusion.
 3.  Cardiomegaly.
