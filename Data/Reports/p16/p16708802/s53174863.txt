 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Tachypnea, diminished breath sounds, rule out pleural effusion.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of a large right pleural effusion.  The effusion occupies about one half of
 the right hemithorax.  There is unchanged evidence of substantial atelectasis
 of lower lung areas on the right.  The left hemithorax appears unremarkable. 
 PICC line on the right and nasogastric tube is in unchanged position.
