 CHEST AP 
 
 The size of the right effusion present on the prior chest x-ray is diminished
 and a pigtail catheter is seen at the right lung base laterally.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Some mild opacity is seen overlying the right
 upper lung.  This could be caused a small amount of pleural fluid. 
 Infiltrates seems unlikely given the prior chest x-ray.
