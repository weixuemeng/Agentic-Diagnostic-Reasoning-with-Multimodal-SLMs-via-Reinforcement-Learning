                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with ethanol cirrhosis complicated by recurrent
 hepatic hydrothorax.  Now reaccumulated effusion and dyspnea.  Evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient was examined in upright position using PA and lateral chest
 view projections.  Patient is mildly tilted towards the left on the frontal
 view.  One observes now a total white out of the right hemithorax with only
 mild degree of mediastinal shift towards the left.  Considering patient's
 clinical history and radiographic evidence of several large right-sided
 pleural effusions treated with successful thoracocentesis (___
 ___ and ___) this most likely represents reaccumulation of the pleural effusion.
 The apparently massive pleural effusion obscures partially the central airways
 and the possibility of a centrally located right main bronchus narrowing or
 occlusion just distal to the carina cannot be excluded completely but is less
 likely the cause of the complete right-sided pulmonary white out.  The left
 hemithorax does not show any evidence of acute infiltrates or pulmonary
 vascular congestive pattern.  Heart size and configuration appears unaltered.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Massive new right-sided pleural effusion resulting in total white
 out.  Situation was discussed with Dr. ___ ___ page 5:30 p.m.
