                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation of new onset.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is patchy opacification
 in the right infrahilar region.  Differential considerations include a focus
 of bronchopneumonia versus atelectasis, which could also be considered
 depending on clinical circumstances.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear. 
 There is no evidence for congestive heart failure.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy new right infrahilar opacity, for which a subtle
 bronchopneumonia or possibly atelectasis could be considered in the right
 lower lobe.
