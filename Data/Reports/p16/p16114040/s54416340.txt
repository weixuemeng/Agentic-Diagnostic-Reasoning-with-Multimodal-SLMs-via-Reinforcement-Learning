                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after right lower lobe
 wedge surgery.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to prior
 study obtained the day before.
 
 Right lung continues to be partially atelectatic with moderate-to-large right
 pneumothorax.  Chest tubes are in unchanged position.  Epidural catheter is in
 place.  Right mediastinal shift is redemonstrated.  Left pleural effusion
 appears to be slightly more pronounced on the current study as compared to
 prior examination.
