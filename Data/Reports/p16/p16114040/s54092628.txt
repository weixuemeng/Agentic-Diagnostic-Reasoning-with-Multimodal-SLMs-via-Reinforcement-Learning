 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post right lower lobe wedge resection, evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, one of the two right-sided
 chest tubes has been removed.  The presence of a small apical pneumothorax
 cannot be excluded on the basis of imaging.  There is unchanged evidence of
 post-procedure pleural thickening as well as atelectasis at the right lung
 bases.  Minimally decreasing extent of the cervical and lateral soft tissue
 air collection.
 
 Unchanged unremarkable morphology of the left lung.
