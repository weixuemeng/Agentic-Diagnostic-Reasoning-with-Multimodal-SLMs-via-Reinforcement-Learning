                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were provided for review. There is
 calcification of the thoracic aorta. The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar
 contours are stable.  There is increased right pleural effusion with
 opacification of the right lung base.  While this opacification may represent
 pleural effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation or malignancy
 cannot be excluded. The left lung is unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased right pleural effusion with opacification of the right base, which
 may represent a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.  However,
 underlying consolidation or progression of malignancy cannot be excluded.
