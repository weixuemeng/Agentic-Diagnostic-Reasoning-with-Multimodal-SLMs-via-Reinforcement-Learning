                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 948 
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post right lower lobe wedge resection, assess
 for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 948 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left lung remains clear.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  A right basilar chest tube remains in place, and there continues to
 be some right lateral pleural thickening, subcutaneous emphysema of the right
 lateral chest wall soft tissues, chain sutures at the right lung base and the
 right mid lung, surgical clips at the right base and a streaky opacity in the
 right upper lobe which likely represents post-surgical or post-inflammatory
 change.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Clips in the right upper quadrant
 are consistent with cholecystectomy.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  There
 is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Probable small right effusion.
