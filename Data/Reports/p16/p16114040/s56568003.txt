 right lateral pleural thickening and right basilar pleural thickening could be
 post-operative or represent some pleural fluid.  However, the appearance is
 stable.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The left lung remains well inflated and
 clear.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Clips in the right upper
