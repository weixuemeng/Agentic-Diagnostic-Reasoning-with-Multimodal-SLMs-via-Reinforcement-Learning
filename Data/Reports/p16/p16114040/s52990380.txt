                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath, cough, found to
 have a PE, now on Lovenox, now with rhonchorous breath sounds, wheezing on
 exam with continued shortness of breath, assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  Suture material in
 the right mid and upper lung, as well as projecting over the right hemithorax,
 are again noted.  There is a right sixth rib partial resection again seen. 
 The left lung is clear, with possible minimal subsegmental left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  There is right pleural effusion, which is overall unchanged in
 distribution and size.  There is extensive scarring in the right lung, which
 is not significantly changed from prior exam.  Please note, given the extent
 of underlying distortion and scarring, a subtle pneumonia would be impossible
 to exclude.  The overall cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable. 
 No acute bony abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chronic changes in the right lung including scarring and
 distortion with postoperative change.  Old right pleural effusion.  Given the
 degree of underlying chronic abnormality, the possibility of a superimposed
 acute pneumonic process is impossible to exclude on the basis of this
 radiograph.
