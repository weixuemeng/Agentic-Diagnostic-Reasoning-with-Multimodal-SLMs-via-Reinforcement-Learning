                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post right lower lobe wedge resection and one chest
 tube removal.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There is new right subcutaneous emphysema.  Small right pleural effusion has
 decreased.  Two right chest tubes remain in place, one in the apex and one in
 the base.  The left lung is grossly clear.  Cardiac size is normal.  The
 cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the right.  Multifocal opacities in the
 periphery of the right lung are likely atelectases.  Surgical clips project in
 the right hemithorax.
