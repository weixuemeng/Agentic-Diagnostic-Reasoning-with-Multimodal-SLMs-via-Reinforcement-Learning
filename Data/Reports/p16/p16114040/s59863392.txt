                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, history of lung cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post right partial lung resection with multiple chain
 sutures and clips demonstrated in the right hemithorax.  Evidence of
 right-sided volume loss is again demonstrated with rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures.  Persistent nodular pleural thickening is seen within
 the right hemithorax, most pronounced along the lateral and apical regions
 with peripheral opacities along the right mid lung field appearing relatively
 unchanged from the prior exams, and compatible with recurrent disease. 
 Widened right paratracheal stripe is compatible with underlying mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are
 relatively unchanged with diffuse calcification of the thoracic aorta.  The
 left lung is grossly clear.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is seen.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Postsurgical changes of the right rib cage are again
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change from the prior study with nodular pleural
 thickening within the right hemithorax and opacification in the periphery of
 the right mid lung field compatible with recurrent disease.  Unchanged
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  No new areas of focal consolidation identified.
