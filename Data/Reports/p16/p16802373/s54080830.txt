                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with suspected pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Assessment of the lung
 parenchyma demonstrates no obvious consolidations, but on the lateral view
 posterior-inferior to the projection of the hilus there is an opacity that
 might potentially reflect small area of consolidation not appreciated on the
 PA examination.  Given the patient's history, diagnosis of pneumonia would be
 appropriate, and re-assessment in four weeks after completion of antibiotic
 therapy is recommended.
 
 Bilateral cervical ribs are noted, small.
 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
