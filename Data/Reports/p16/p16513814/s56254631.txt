                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and dyspnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation, or pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is blunting of
 the posterior left costophrenic angle suggestive of a small effusion.  Trachea
 is deviated anteriorly at the thoracic inlet.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Possible small left pleural effusion.
 2.  Anterior deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet, which could be
 due to thyroid enlargement.  Thyroid ultrasound is suggested on a non-emergent
 basis.
