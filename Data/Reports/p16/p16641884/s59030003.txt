                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post bypass surgery and
 left-sided cardiac endarterectomy.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Postoperative heart size and position of
 sternotomy sutures unchanged.  The same holds for the previously described
 bilateral chest tubes advanced from below.  No pneumothorax has developed. 
 The accessible portions of the lung vasculature do not demonstrate any
 pulmonary congestive pattern or edema.  Also, the lateral pleural sinuses
 remain rather free.  Noted, however, is the appearance of a new density on the
 right base abutting the minor fissure which is slightly depressed.  This
 suggests that the patient has developed a pneumonic infiltrate, probably in
 the right middle lobe area.  No other new abnormalities are seen.  The
 previously identified right-sided PICC line remains in unchanged position.  A
 previously remaining right internal jugular sheath has been removed.
 
 ___ was paged.
