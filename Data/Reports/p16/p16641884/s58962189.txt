                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Wheezing, to look for effusion, consolidation, edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were read in comparison with prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 pulmonary vascular congestion, small right pleural effusion and ill-defined
 opacity in the right lung base are new since ___ and suggest new
 mildly severe pulmonary edema.  The opacity in the right lung base could be
 either a component of existing pulmonary edema or could be a sequela of
 aspiration.  Heart size is normal.  Aorta is mildly tortuous.  Hilar contours
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mildly severe pulmonary edema and small right pleural effusion
 are new.  Ill-defined right lower lung opacity could be a part of coexisting
 edema or may be a sequela of aspiration.
