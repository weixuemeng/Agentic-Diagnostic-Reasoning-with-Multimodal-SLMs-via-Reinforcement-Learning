                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of coronary artery disease,
 status post bypass surgery in ___, end-stage renal disease on
 hemodialysis with tunneled catheter since ___.  Status post right
 radiocephalic AV fistula placement on ___.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm
 status post EVAR repair on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting position using
 AP frontal and left lateral views.  There is status post sternotomy,
 apparently related to previous bypass surgery.  The heart size remains within
 normal limits.  The thoracic aorta is mildly widened and elongated, but no
 local contour abnormalities are identified.  A wide caliber double-lumen
 catheter has been introduced via the left internal jugular vein and advanced
 so to terminate in the mid portion of the right atrium.  This HD line is also
 well demonstrated on the lateral view in its course through the SVC.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There is no evidence of any acute
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate.  No pneumothorax in the apical area and
 lateral pleural sinuses are free.  On the lateral view, a small amount of
 pleural effusion or pleural scar formation exists in the posterior pleural
 sinus on the left side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or acute
 infiltrates.  When comparison is made with the next preceding chest
 examination transferred from ___ dated ___, improvement of the at that time existing pulmonary vascular congestion
 is remarkable.  The lungs are now completely clear and not congested.
