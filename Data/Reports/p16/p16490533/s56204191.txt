                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:56
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypoxia, assess for change in pulmonary
 edema.
 
 Comparison to ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 4:57 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There continues to be a diffuse bilateral airspace process with more
 consolidative components in both lower lobes.  Overall, however, there is
 improving aeration, suggesting that there has been some interval improvement
 in the severe pulmonary edema.  Alternatively, this could represent an
 infection superimposed on underlying interstitial lung disease.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  There is likely a small layering left effusion. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given
 differences in positioning.  No pneumothorax is seen.
