                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:06 P.M., ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new nasogastric tube.  Assess position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Two AP images of the chest compared to ___.
 
 The image performed last shows a nasogastric tube previously in the mid
 esophagus advanced to the upper abdomen.  Judging from the low position of the
 moderately distended stomach on ___, the nasogastric tube needs to be
 advanced another 10 cm so that all the side ports are in the stomach.  Severe
 pulmonary edema has worsened.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal
 vascular engorgement are unchanged.  Pleural effusions are presumed, but not
 large.  Right PICC line ends low in the SVC.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings by telephone at the time of
 dictation..
