 COMPARISONS: ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is again mild to moderately enlarged.  There is a similar patchy
 opacity in the left lower lobe which does not appear changed.  Streaky right
 middle lobe opacification suggests minor atelectasis or scarring.  Similarly,
 right lateral rib deformities with pleural thickening, also probably chronic,
 appear similar as well.  Post-traumatic findings involving the right clavicle
 are likewise stable.
