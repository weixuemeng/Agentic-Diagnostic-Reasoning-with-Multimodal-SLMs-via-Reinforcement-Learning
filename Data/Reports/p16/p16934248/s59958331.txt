                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.  Question fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There are ill-defined, right greater than left,
 increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs.  There is no definite
 large confluent consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits and unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires again noted.  Probably
 post-traumatic changes at the lateral right clavicle are again seen in
 addition to old posterior right sixth rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings in the lungs bilaterally,
 asymmetrically more so on the right than on the left.  These findings could be
 related to either pulmonary edema versus atypical infection.  Clinical
 correlation suggested.
