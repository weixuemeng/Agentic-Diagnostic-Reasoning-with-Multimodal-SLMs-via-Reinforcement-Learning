                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and CT.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Worsening respiratory distress.  Assess for interval
 change.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again seen.  Diffuse airspace
 opacity is seen within the lungs, marginally worse compared with prior. 
 Findings are concerning for fluid pneumonia or possibly pulmonary edema. 
 Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged.  Bony structures
 appear grossly intact with old deformity of the right mid clavicle again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight worsening in diffuse pulmonary airspace opacity concerning
 for infection and/or edema.  Close followup advised.
