  Increased interstitial prominence on the right has improved.  Interstitial
  prominence and hazy opacification persists on the left, predominantly in the
  middle and lower lung zones.  This could be due to an atypical infection;
  alternatively, it could be due to asymmetric edema.  No focal consolidation is
  identified.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
  silhouette is unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, esophageal dysmotility.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is slightly
 rotated.  The left lung appears slightly denser than on the right.  This could
 in part be due to a technical artifact, in part, however, there could be a
 truly increase in lung density.  Early pneumonia or pulmonary edema could be
 possible explanations.
 
 In turn, the right lung is increased in transparency, likely reflecting
 improved ventilation.
 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged right clavicular changes
 and healed right rib fractures.  The sternal wires are in constant position.
