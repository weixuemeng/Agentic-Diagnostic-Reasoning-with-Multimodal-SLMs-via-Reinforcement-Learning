                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with newly placed NGT  // NGT position
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 17:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An NG tube is present.  The tip extends beneath the diaphragm and overlies the
 left upper/ mid abdomen.  The sideport overlies the expected site of the
 proximal stomach, distal to the GE junction.  Surgical clips are noted over
 the mid abdomen.Irregular opacity previously seen in the mid abdomen  is no
 longer visualized.  No free air is seen beneath the diaphragms.  No air-filled
 dilated loops of bowel are seen in the visualized portion of the abdomen.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, raising the question of background COPD.  The
 heart is not enlarged.  There is no CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion.  Near
 complete interval clearing of previously seen left base platelike atelectasis
 is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. NG tube tip and side-port extend beyond the GE junction and overlie the
 stomach.
 2. No acute pulmonary process identified.
