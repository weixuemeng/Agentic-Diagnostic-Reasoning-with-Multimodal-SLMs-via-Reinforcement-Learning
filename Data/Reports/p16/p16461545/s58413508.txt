                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // eval for pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings.  Given this, somewhat linear right base opacity is felt to more
 likely represent atelectasis rather than consolidation.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Cardiac
 silhouette size is top-normal, likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
