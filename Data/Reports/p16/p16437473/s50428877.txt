                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:   ___F with hypoxia. Evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, accentuating the pulmonary vasculature and cardiac
 contour. Heterogeneous opacity in the right middle lobe could represent
 atelectasis or focus of developing infection.  Blunting of the costophrenic
 angles bilaterally likely indicate small pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Heterogeneous right middle lobe opacity could represent atelectasis or
 developing infection.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
