                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with ___ syndrome presents with dyspnea. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Left lower lobe and middle lobe opacities appear to
 have essentially resolved.  Residual opacity near the left costophrenic angle
 is minimal in could be atelectasis and/or residual from prior in infection.  A
 right subpulmonic pleural effusion is small.  A left pleural effusion if
 present is trace.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.  No new focal consolidations.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No new focal consolidations.  Very minimal residual opacity near the left
 costophrenic angle may be atelectasis and/or sequelae of recent infection.
 
 2.  Small subpulmonic right pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Possible trace left pleural effusion.
