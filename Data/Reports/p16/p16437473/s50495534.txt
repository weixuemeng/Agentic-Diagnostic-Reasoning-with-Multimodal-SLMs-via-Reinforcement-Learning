                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, thyroid ___ at.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is normal.  Streaky opacities are demonstrated within both lower lobes, more
 so on the left.  While prior exams did demonstrate bibasilar opacities, the
 opacity within the left lung base appears to have progressed.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky bibasilar opacities, slightly progressed on the left.  Findings may
 reflect left lower lobe atelectasis or infection superimposed upon chronic
 bibasilar scarring.
