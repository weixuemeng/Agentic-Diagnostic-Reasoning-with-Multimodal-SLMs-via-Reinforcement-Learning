                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with wolfram syndrome, multiple pneumonias
 presenting with  // ?pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacity at the left lung base peripherally is worrisome for infectious
 process.  Question nodular opacity in the right lower lung zone medially,
 possibly superimposed shadows.  Previous right middle lobe opacity seen on
 radiograph dated ___ has resolved.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Upper lung zones appear clear.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no air under
 the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lung base opacity is worrisome for early infectious process. 
 Nodular opacity projecting over the right middle lobe likely reflects
 superimposed vascular structures.  Previous right middle lobe pneumonia has
 resolved.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are small.
