                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with hypoxia and recent pneumonia.  Assess for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.  Patchy
 bibasilar opacities persist and are not significantly changed from prior
 study.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema is seen.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 In comparison to ___ exam, there is no significant change in bibasilar
 patchy opacities, which likely represent atelectasis, aspiration, or infection
 in the appropriate clinical setting, although the lack of any change perhaps
 makes chronic findings more likely.
