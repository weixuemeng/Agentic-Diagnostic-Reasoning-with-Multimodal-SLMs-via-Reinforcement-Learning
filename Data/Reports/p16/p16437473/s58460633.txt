                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with increased weakness.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Similarly to the prior chest radiograph, lung volumes are low, causing
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  The previously described right
 middle lobe heterogeneous opacity has improved.  Mild basilar streaky
 opacifications are likely due to atelectasis.  No new focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  Mild blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles are
 consistent with small pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes, causing crowding of bronchovascular structures. 
 Previously described right middle lobe opacity has improved.
 
 2.  No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Likely bibasilar streaky
 atelectasis.
 
 3.  Small bilateral effusions.
