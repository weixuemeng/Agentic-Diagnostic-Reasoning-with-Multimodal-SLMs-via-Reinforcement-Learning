                                 FINAL REPORT
 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this day, there is little change. 
 Continued prominence of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta
 but no vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  Specifically, no evidence of
 acute focal pneumonia or substantial atelectatic change.  Cardiac silhouette
 is at the upper limits of normal in size or slightly enlarged and there is
 mild tortuosity of the aorta.  No vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
 
 No convincing evidence of acute pneumonia.
