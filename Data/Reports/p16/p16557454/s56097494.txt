                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multifocal pneumonia.  Evaluation for resolution.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, ___ - ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  The most noticeable
 consolidation in the right upper lobe has resolved.  Previously described
 opacities in the lower lobes are less conspicuous and there is no correlate on
 the lateral view, making residual pneumonia unlikely.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolved right upper lobe pneumonia.
