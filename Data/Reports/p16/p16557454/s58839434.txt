                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Myotonic dystrophy, presenting with chest pain and
 bibasilar crackles.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Subtle left basilar opacity is seen, not seen on the lateral view
 could be due to atelectasis; however, an early mild infectious process is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle patchy left basilar opacity could be due to atelectasis,
 although in the appropriate clinical setting, consolidation is not excluded.
