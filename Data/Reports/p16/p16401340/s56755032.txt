                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Left shoulder radiographs of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A linear opacity in the left suprahilar region is new compared to
 shoulder radiographs of ___ and is associated with a subtle slight
 increase in opacity of the adjacent left hilum.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear.  Heart size and mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no acute
 pleural or skeletal abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific linear opacity in left juxtahilar region which may
 reflect an area of focal atelectasis or scarring.  Considering slight increase
 in opacity of adjacent left hilum, followup radiographs may be helpful in four
 to six weeks to assess for resolution and to exclude the possibility of an
 obstructive process in this region.  
 
 Findings entered into radiology communications dashboard on the date of the
