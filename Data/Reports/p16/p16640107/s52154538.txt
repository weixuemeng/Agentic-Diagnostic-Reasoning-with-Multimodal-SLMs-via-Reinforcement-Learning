                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  There is subtle increased
 opacity in the right mid lung, which was not present on prior.  Elsewhere,
 lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette within normal limits.  The
 trachea is again deviated to the right at the thoracic inlet with increased
 soft tissue density suggesting left thyroid enlargement.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Faint opacity projecting over the right mid lung, new from prior,
 could represent a pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.  Otherwise,
 unchanged appearance with probable left-sided thyroid enlargement and
 rightward deviation of the trachea.
