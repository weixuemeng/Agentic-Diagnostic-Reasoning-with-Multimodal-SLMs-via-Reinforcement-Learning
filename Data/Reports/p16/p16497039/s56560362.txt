                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MI with fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung
 volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  There may be
 minimal elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Left basilar opacification is
 consistent with combination of pleural effusion and volume loss in the left
 lower lobe.  There may be mild atelectatic changes of the right base as well.
 
 The right PICC line extends to the cavoatrial junction or upper portion of the
 right atrium.
 
 Of incidental note again are severe degenerative changes in the right
 shoulder.
