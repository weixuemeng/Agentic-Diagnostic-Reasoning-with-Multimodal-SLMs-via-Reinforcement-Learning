                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with polytrauma, a new NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same day earlier exam at 10:46 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube with tip 3.8
 cm from the carina.  A left subclavian approach central venous catheter has
 tip in the mid SVC.  A left basal approach chest catheter is similar in
 position.  A new enteric tube has tip terminating in the proximal stomach and
 side port likely in the region of GE junction, with moderate air distention of
 the stomach, consistent with ineffective decompression.  The tube should be
 advanced by approximately 10 cm.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is little
 changed since preceding exam.  Lung volumes are low, with similar appearance
 of perihilar vascular prominence.  Retrocardiac opacity is compatible with
 atelectasis.  Moderate air distension of the stomach is similar as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of feeding tube with tip in the proximal
 stomach, which should be advanced by at least 10 cm to achieve effective
 gastric decompression.  Otherwise, no relevant change since preceding exam
 several hours ago.
 
 Findings reported to Dr. ___ at 4:30 pm on ___ via phone by Dr. ___.
