                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, here to evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right PICC is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in
 the low SVC.  The inspiratory lung volumes remain low and slightly decreased
 from the most recent prior study.  Bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural
 effusions are unchanged.  No pneumothorax is detected, although irregular
 vertically oriented linear densities project over the right hemithorax, which
 likely represent material external to the patient.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is stable.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but
 unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits with mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and calcification of the aortic arch.  The
 left hilus appears prominent, which is unchanged from the prior study.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.  Moderate to severe degenerative
 change is noted in the right shoulder joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Stable appearance of the chest with mild vascular congestion and small
 bilateral pleural effusions on the left greater than the right with underlying
 atelectasis.
 3.  Right shoulder osteoarthritis.
