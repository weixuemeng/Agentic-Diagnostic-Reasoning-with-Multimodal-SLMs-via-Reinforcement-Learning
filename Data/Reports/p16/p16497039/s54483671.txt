                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Newly
 developed patchy and linear right lower lobe opacities, most likely due to
 atelectasis.  Worsening left retrocardiac opacity could be due to either
 atelectasis or infectious consolidation, and is accompanied by a moderate,
 layering left pleural effusion.
