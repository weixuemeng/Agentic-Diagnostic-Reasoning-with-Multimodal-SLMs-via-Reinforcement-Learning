                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Trauma with endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 7:26 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube remains in place with the tip projecting 5 cm
 cranial to the carina.  There has been interval increase in size of the
 cardiac silhouette as well as distention of the mediastinal vasculature,
 compatible with congestion without interstitial edema.  Lung volumes are low
 with associated bibasilar atelectasis.  A left PICC remains in place with the
 tip projecting over the upper SVC.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Central pulmonary vascular congestion, without frank edema. 
 Endotracheal tube and left PICC are appropriately placed.
