                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Slight increase in opacity projecting over the lung bases is likely due to
 overlying soft tissue.  There is subtle increased opacity at the right lung
 base which could be due to early consolidation versus atelectasis.  The left
 lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle streaky opacity at the right lung base may represent atelectasis
 however, consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
