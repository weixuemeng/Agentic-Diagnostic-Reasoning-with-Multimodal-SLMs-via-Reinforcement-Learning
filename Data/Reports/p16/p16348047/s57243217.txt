                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  There is no confluent consolidation or
 effusion.  Interstitial markings do appear more conspicuous on the current
 exam.  This could be in part due to technique and low lung volumes however
 underlying interstitial abnormality is also possible.  There is mild to
 moderate cardiomegaly.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased interstitial markings in the lungs which could be in part attributed
 to technique although additional considerations include interstitial edema,
 chronic underlying lung disease or atypical infection.
