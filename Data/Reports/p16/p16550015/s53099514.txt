                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The
 lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  On this
 study, there is patchy retrocardiac opacity, streaky in nature, similar to
 earlier lateral radiographs.  Streaky opacities in the lingula also suggest
 atelectasis.  The patient is status post open reduction and internal fixation
 of the proximal humerus.  The bones appear demineralized.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left posterior opacities suggesting minor atelectasis.
