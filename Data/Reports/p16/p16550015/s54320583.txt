                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside institution chest x-ray from ___ and two-view
 chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Low lung volumes seen on the
 current exam.  Linear right basilar opacity laterally obscuring the
 costophrenic angle may be due to atelectasis.  Superiorly, the lungs are
 clear.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but likely accentuated due to low
 lung volumes and not definitely changed from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:   Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to
 atelectasis given low lung volumes.  Dedicated two-view chest x-ray may offer
 additional detail
