                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Study is limited by body habitus.  Lung volumes are low,
 accentuating the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vasculature.  Given low lung
 volumes, heart size is only mildly enlarged. Previous mild pulmonary edema and
 mediastinal venous engorgement have resolved, although pulmonary vascular
 congestion persists.  Lungs are otherwise clear. Thoracic aorta is mildly
 tortuous.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Plate-like atelectasis at the
 right lung base persists. Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild heart failure improved since ___. Mild atelectasis.
