                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:53 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with fever.  Desaturating after attempted LP. 
 Possible aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Greater opacification in the left upper lung could be pneumonia.  An artifact
 is introduced by RPO positioning, and I strongly urged conventional chest
 radiographs if at all feasible to see if there really is pneumonia in the left
 lung.  The right pulmonary artery is chronically large, but more dilated today
 than before.  This is sometimes a sign of pulmonary embolism which should be
 considered, given the clinical history provided.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 underestimated because of the rotation.
 
 A left internal jugular line ends at the origin of the SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 2:15 when the findings were recognized.
