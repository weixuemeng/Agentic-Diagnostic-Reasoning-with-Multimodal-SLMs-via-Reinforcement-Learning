                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough, prior SBO, diffuse abdominal pain,
 question evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently AP and lateral chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs are provided.  Again seen is a
 moderate right pleural effusion, unchanged in appearance since the prior exam.
 Overlying opacity is likely due to atelectasis.  There are coarsened
 interstitial markings bilaterally, predominantly in apices which may be
 related to scarring from prior radiation.  The cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged.  Bones are demineralized.  Old healed rib fractures are seen in the
 right seventh posterior rib and the left sixth posterior ribs.  There is
 scoliosis of the spine.  No free air below the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate right pleural effusion, unchanged since the prior exam. 
 Overlying opacities likely atelectasis.
 2.  Mild prominence of interstitial markings predominantly in the apices,
 which may be due scarring from prior radiation.
