                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Small bowel obstruction.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  Associated with
 recent contrast administration is an asymmetric pyelogram with relatively
 little opacification in the left renal collecting system but persistent
 opacification of the right renal collecting system, which appears mildly
 dilated.  There is a moderate pleural effusion on the right with associated
 opacity that could probably be attributed to associated compressive
 atelectasis, although not entirely specific.  Patchy left basilar opacity is
 also noted.  There is no free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Appropriate positioning of nasogastric tube.
 
 2.  Moderate right-sided pleural effusion with associated parenchymal opacity
 in the right lower lobe, probably atelectasis, although not entirely specific.
 
 3.  Persistent opacification of a mild to moderately dilated right renal
 collecting system, compared to the left.  This appearance may relate to a
 prominent extrarenal pelvis or potentially a low-grade form of ureteropelvic
 junction obstruction could be considered.
