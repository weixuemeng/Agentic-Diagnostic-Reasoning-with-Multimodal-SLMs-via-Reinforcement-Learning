                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 tortuous and diffusely calcified.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  More focal
 opacity in the left lung base could reflect atelectasis but infection is not
 excluded.  Probable trace bilateral pleural effusions are present.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.  Multiple clips are
 noted within the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with probable trace bilateral pleural effusions.
 More focal opacity in the left lung base could reflect atelectasis but
 infection cannot be excluded.
