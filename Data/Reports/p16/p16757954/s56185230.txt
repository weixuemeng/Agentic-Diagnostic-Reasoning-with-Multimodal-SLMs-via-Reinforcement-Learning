                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hematemesis or hemoptysis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Large hiatal hernia is
 present.  Heart size is normal.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is
 present.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Hyperinflation of lungs
 with flattening of the diaphragms and increased AP diameter of the thorax is
 compatible with underlying COPD.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities are
 nonspecific, and could reflect atelectasis.  Infection and aspiration are not
 excluded.  Previously noted left perihilar abnormality has resolved.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  No pleural effusion is identified.  Diffuse demineralization
 of the osseous structures is noted with multilevel degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities are nonspecific, and could reflect
 atelectasis or infection.  Aspiration is also not excluded.
 
 2. Large hiatal hernia.
 
 3. COPD.
