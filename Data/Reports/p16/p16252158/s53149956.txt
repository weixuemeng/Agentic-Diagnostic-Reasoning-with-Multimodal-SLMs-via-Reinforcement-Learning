                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough, hypothermia and hypoglycemia. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Exam is limited due to portable technique.  Given
 differences in positioning, noting lordosis on the current exam, there has
 been no significant interval change.  There is no definite confluent
 consolidation.  Mild cardiomegaly is also likely accentuated for the reasons
 stated above.  Dense mitral annular calcifications are noted.  Osseous
 structures are grossly unremarkable.  There is mild left lateral deviation of
 the trachea just proximal to the thoracic inlet, raising the possibility of
 underlying thyroid enlargement.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Probable mild cardiomegaly without definite acute cardiopulmonary process
 given positioning and technique.
 2.  Possible mild left tracheal deviation, just above the thoracic inlet,
 raising possibility of right-sided thyroid enlargement.  Ultrasound could
 further characterize if desired.
