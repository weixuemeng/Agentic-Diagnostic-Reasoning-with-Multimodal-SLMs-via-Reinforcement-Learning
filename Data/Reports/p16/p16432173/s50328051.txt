                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with possible clinical stroke.  Evaluate for
 pulmonary infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is slightly rotated during this examination.  Lung volumes are
 slightly lower compared to ___.   New bibasilar opacities may
 represent atelectasis in the setting of lower lung volumes, but aspiration or
 infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  An oblong
 opacity in the right midlung could reflect linear atelectasis or fissural
 fluid.  Pulmonary edema is mild and more pronounced on the left.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  No pneumothorax.  Heart
 size remains moderately enlarged.  Median sternotomy wires are intact. 
 Multiple surgical clips are noted along the mediastinum.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis or aspiration/infection.
 2. Mild asymmetrical pulmonary edema.
 3. Left greater than right pleural effusions.
