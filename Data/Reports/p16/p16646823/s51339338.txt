                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Focal mediastinal contour abnormalities in
 the aorticopulmonary and lower right paratracheal region are accompanied by
 bilateral hilar enlargement with lobulation and associated opacity in the
 inferior hilar window on the lateral view.  Together, these findings are
 concerning for mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.  Lungs are
 clear, and there are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.  Within
 the imaged portion of the abdomen, there is apparent splenic enlargement with
 medial displacement of the gastric bubble.  Hepatic contour also appears
 prominent, but these contours are not optimally evaluated on a chest
 radiograph exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Findings suggestive of mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph node
 enlargement.  Lymphadenopathy is not a common manifestation of malaria, which
 more commonly presents with pulmonary findings of ARDS or eosinophilic
 pneumonia. In the absence of older radiographs for comparison, consider chest
 CT with contrast for confirmation and further characterization of this
 finding.  Findings communicated to the physician covering for Dr. ___ by
 telephone on ___ at 11:38 a.m. at the time of discovery.
 
 2. Apparent splenomegaly, which may be related to history of malaria.
