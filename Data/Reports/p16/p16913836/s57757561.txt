                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with L lobar hemorrhage. Pleural effusions.  //
 Interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 04:33
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube present, tip approximately 0.1 cm above the carina.  NG tube present,
 tip and side-port beneath diaphragm, with tip extending beyond film.  Right IJ
 central line tip overlies the proximal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar, possibly slightly decreased in
 size.  Retrocardiac density is significantly improved, with negligible
 residua.  Minimal subsegmental atelectasis at both bases noted.  Hazy opacity
 at the right costophrenic angle could reflect a small right effusion.  Minimal
 blunting left costophrenic angle remains present, improved compared with
 previously seen left effusion.
 
 Rounded opacity overlying the left lung base is noted, question nipple shadow.
 (Review of chest x-ray from ___, suggests that this represents a
 nipple shadow).  Attention to this area on followup films is requested.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Significant interval improvement in retrocardiac opacity, with minimal
 residual subsegmental atelectasis the left lung base.  Left pleural effusion
 has also decreased in size.
 
 Right base atelectasis has improved.  Small residual right pleural effusion is
 noted.
 
 Probable nipple shadow left lung base.  Please see comment above.
