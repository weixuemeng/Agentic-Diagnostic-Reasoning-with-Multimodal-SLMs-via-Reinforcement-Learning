 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:40 PM
  The endotracheal tube ends 3.5 cm above the level of the carina.  Two enteric
  catheters course below the level of the diaphragm and out of the field of view
  inferiorly.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the mid
  SVC.  Dense left retrocardiac atelectasis is not significantly changed.  A
  small left pleural effusion is likely present, unchanged.  No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient with respiratory failure.  Difficult to
 passing suction, assess tube kinks in the ET tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 ET tube is straighter with no kinks and is in the standard position with tip
 3.5 cm above the carina.  The enteric tubes are outside the field of view
 below the diaphragm.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  Left lower
 lobe atelectasis has increased.  Small left effusion is probably unchanged. 
 Right lower lobe atelectasis is stable.  Mild vascular congestion is stable. 
 There is no evident pneumothorax.  There are low lung volumes.  Cardiac size
 is top normal.
