 HISTORY:  Diabetic ketoacidosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  Assessment of the lungs is somewhat limited due to motion.  Allowing
 for this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slightly limited assessment of the lung bases due to patient motion. 
 Otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary process.
