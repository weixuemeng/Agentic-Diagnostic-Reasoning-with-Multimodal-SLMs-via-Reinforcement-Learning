 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard
 position.  Slight decrease in width of cardiomediastinal contours accompanied
 by improving pulmonary vascular congestion.  Improving aeration at the lung
 bases with residual patchy and linear atelectasis.
 Bilateral layering pleural effusions appear slightly smaller, but positional
 differences could potentially contribute to this apparent change.
