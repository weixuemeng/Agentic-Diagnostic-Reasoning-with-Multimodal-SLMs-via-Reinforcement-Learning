 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  There is massive cardiomegaly
 as seen on prior.  There is no focal consolidation worrisome for infection. 
 The trachea is deviated to the right at the thoracic inlet with increased soft
 tissue density in the midline and just to the left which is likely due to
 thyroid enlargement.  This appearance is similar compared to prior.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities.

 process.
