  1. Retrocardiac atelectasis without definite pneumonia. 2. Persistent severe
  cardiomegaly 3. Mild mediastinal widening likely related to patient
  positioning and low lung volumes. 4. Stable rightward tracheal deviation is
  likely due to enlarged thyroid.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with AMS assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal semi upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is severe cardiomegaly, unchanged in appearance since previous
 examination.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity is most consistent with
 atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Mild mediastinal widening is
 likely related to semi upright positioning and low lung volumes.  The trachea
 is again noted to be deviated rightward with associated soft tissue likely due
 to an enlarged thyroid.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Retrocardiac atelectasis without definite pneumonia.
 2. Persistent severe cardiomegaly
 3. Mild mediastinal widening likely related to patient positioning and low
 lung volumes.
 4. Stable rightward tracheal deviation is likely due to enlarged thyroid.
