                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are no new areas of consolidation in the lungs to suggest the
 presence of pneumonia.  Again demonstrated is a large left superior
 mediastinal mass with associated marked rightward tracheal displacement and
 tracheal narrowing, with coronal dimension of the trachea of approximately 5
 mm above the thoracic inlet level.  As compared to the prior radiograph, the
 extent of displacement and severity of narrowing has slightly worsened. 
 Cardiac silhouette remains markedly enlarged, though pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  Aorta is tortuous and calcified.  Focal linear scar in left mid lung
 is unchanged.  No pleural effusion or acute skeletal finding.  Calcifications
 in the left supraclavicular region are again demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Large thyroid mass displacing and narrowing the trachea as described.
