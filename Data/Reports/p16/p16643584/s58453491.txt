  1.  New right basilar opacity with volume loss and pleural effusion. 
  Parenchymal opacification may be explained by atelectasis associated with the
  presence of an effusion, although an infectious etiology cannot be entirely
  excluded.  
  
  2.  Small nodular focus projecting over the left upper lung.  A lung nodule
  cannot be excluded.  When clinically appropriate, short-term repeat PA and
  lateral radiographs are recommended to see whether the nodular focus is
  persistently demonstrated or chest CT evaluation could be considered.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Back pain and weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is new mild rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures, probably due to atelectasis in the right lower lobe
 with a small-to-moderate new right-sided pleural effusion.  Projecting over
 the left upper lung is a small nodular focus that is not perceptible on the
 prior study.  Possibly it reflects a prior healed fracture involving the
 posterolateral course of the left sixth rib, but the healed fracture was
 already there and otherwise unchanged, so the possibility of a pulmonary
 nodule projecting over the same area should be considered and excluded.  There
 is no evidence for pleural effusion on the left.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Bony demineralization with mild degenerative changes are noted along the
 thoracic spine.  It is difficult to compare an upper lumbar compression
 deformity at L1 with the prior study, although it can be discerned.
