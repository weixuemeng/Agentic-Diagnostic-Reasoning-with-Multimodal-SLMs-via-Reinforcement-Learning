                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with past medical history of COPD and recently
 diagnosed metastatic small cell lung cancer.  Hypoxemia after aspiration of
 thin liquids.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to chest radiographs and CT on ___:
 
 There has been no change in extensive malignancy in the left upper lobe and
 infiltrate in the mediastinum and left hilus.  On the right a focal
 well-defined 4 cm wide lesion with a suggestion of central cavitation has
 grown appreciably more radiodense on the conventional radiograph.  Chest CT
 showed that this was a necrotic mass and this raises the possibility of
 hemorrhage into that lesion.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Very small left
 pleural effusion is slightly larger.  I discussed these findings and their
 clinical implications with ___, by telephone at 12 noon.
