                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic SCLC here with pancytopenia,
 refractory thrombocytopenia, with worsening lung exam including crackles  //
 eval for intrathoracic process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CT obtained the same day.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right mid lung nodule or mass corresponds to known neoplastic deposit. 
 Mediastinal widening appears to be minimally improved since the prior study.
 Left apical mass is re- demonstrated.  Lower lungs are clear with no evidence
 of new consolidation to suggest interval development of infectious process.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. Overall the findings appear to
 be related to known metastatic lung cancer with no evidence of infectious
 process abuts correlation with chest CT is to be considered
