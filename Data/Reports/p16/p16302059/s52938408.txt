                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year -old man with fevers and cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to prior exam, there is improved inspiratory effort and improved
 lung volumes.  Allowing for changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are stable, possibly with mild cardiomegaly.  A right-sided PICC
 line terminates at the mid to low SVC.  The bilateral hila are unremarkable. 
 Retrocardiac opacity likely represents basilar atelectasis. The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 There is a persistent small right pleural effusion.  There is no left pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes.  Persistent small right pleural effusion with basilar
 atelectasis.  No focal lung consolidation.
 2. Right PICC line terminating in the mid to low SVC.
