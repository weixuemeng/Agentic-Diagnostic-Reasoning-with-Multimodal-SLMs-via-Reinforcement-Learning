 COMPARISON:  No comparison
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung volumes are low. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No
 pleural effusions.
 
 The density of the lung parenchyma is slightly increased at the level of the
 right upper lobe bases and of the right lower lobe basis. These areas of

 the frontal and the lateral radiograph. In the appropriate clinical setting,
 these changes could reflect pneumonia.
