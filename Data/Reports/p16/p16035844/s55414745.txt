                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Heart failure and altered mental status, here to evaluate for
 interval change.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, ___ and ___.  
 
 Technique:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are decreased from the most recent prior study.  There is
 increased opacification of the bilateral lung bases reflecting increased
 bilateral pleural effusions and underlying atelectasis.  Increased opacities
 extending cranially for the left lung apex is compatible with fluid in the
 fissure.  Increased opacities in the right lung apex most likely represent
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, which is worsening from ___.  Pulmonary
 vascular congestion is again noted.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The cardio
 mediastinal silhouette is incompletely evaluated but likely unchanged with
 severe cardiomegaly and calcification of the aortic knob.  A left pectoral
 pacemaker is unchanged with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased size of bilateral pleural effusions and worsening underlying
 bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of decreased lung volumes from ___. 
 
 2.  Worsening asymmetric pulmonary edema predominantly in the right lung apex.
 
 3.  Pulmonary vascular congestion.
