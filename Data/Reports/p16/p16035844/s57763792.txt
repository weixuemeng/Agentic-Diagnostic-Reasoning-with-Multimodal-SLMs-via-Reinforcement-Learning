                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 4:07 P.M. ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with congestive heart failure after diuresis. 
 Possible pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe pulmonary edema has not improved, accompanied by at least small
 bilateral pleural effusions and moderate to severe cardiomegaly.  Transvenous
 right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads follow
 their expected courses.  There is no pneumothorax.  Given the severity of
 pulmonary edema, concurrent pneumonia would not be appreciated, but need not
 be invoked to explain the radiographic findings.
