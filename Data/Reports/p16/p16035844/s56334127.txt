  Compared to the radiograph from 3 days ago, there is persistent severe
  pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.  The density of the airspace
  opacities in the bilateral upper lobes has increased, perhaps suggesting
  worsening consolidation.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, acute oxygen desaturation, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the
 pre-existing diffuse and severe parenchymal opacities are overall unchanged. 
 The opacities are predominating in both lung apices and at the bases of the
 right lung.  There is unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  The presence of
 pleural effusions is likely.  No new parenchymal opacities.  Lung volumes
 remain low.  The left pectoral pacemaker is in unchanged position.
