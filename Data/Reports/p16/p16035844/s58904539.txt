                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker device has leads terminating in the right
 atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The lung volumes are low.  The heart
 appears mild-to-moderately enlarged.  Allowing for differences in technique,
 the mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Perihilar fullness and a
 mild-to-moderate interstitial abnormality are very similar to the prior
 examination, so there has been no acute change but findings suggest
 mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  What is new on this study is a
 patchy new left basilar opacity, but not specific.  Pneumonia could be
 considered, but the location and context are typical for atelectasis.  Small
 pleural effusions appear new.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar findings suggesting mild-to-moderate interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  New small bilateral pleural effusions and left basilar
 density, atelectasis versus pneumonia.
