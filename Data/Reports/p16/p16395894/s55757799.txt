                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with central line
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ at 02:49
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC.
 No pneumothorax is present. The heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous
 and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable. No pulmonary vascular congestion is
 demonstrated. Patchy opacity is noted within the left lower lobe concerning
 for aspiration or pneumonia. Streaky atelectasis is also noted in the right
 lung base. No additional focal consolidation is present. No large pleural
 effusion is demonstrated.  Clips in the upper neck indicate prior
 thyroidectomy. Superior subluxation of the right humerus with respect to the
 glenoid is noted with extensive degenerative changes and narrowing of the
 acromiohumeral interval suggestive of rotator cuff disease. Rounded ossific
 densities in the region of the left shoulder likely reflect loose bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the mid SVC. No
 pneumothorax.
 2. Left lower lobe aspiration or pneumonia.
