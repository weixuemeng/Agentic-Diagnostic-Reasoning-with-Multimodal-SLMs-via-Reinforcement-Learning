                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with mechanical fall on ___ with shortness
 of breath and chest pain admitted at outside hospital with known pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16:45.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  When compared to recent exam from earlier
 the same day, there has been no significant interval change given differences
 in projection.  Small to moderate right-sided pleural effusion is seen with
 air-fluid level at the right lung base compatible with presumably seen
 hematopneumothorax.  Pneumothorax is seen along the chest wall laterally was
 summoned loculation superolaterally and relatively larger component at the
 base posteriorly.  The left lung is notable for apical scarring. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits without shift to suggest
 tension.  No displaced fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small to moderate right-sided pneumothorax with loculations superolaterally
 and larger component at the base posteriorly as well.  Air-fluid level
 compatible with hemato or hydropneumothorax.
