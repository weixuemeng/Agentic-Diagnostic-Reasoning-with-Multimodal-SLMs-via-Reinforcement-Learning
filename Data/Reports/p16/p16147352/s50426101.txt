 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 A ___-year-old man with right pneumothorax and effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 A moderate-sized right hydropneumothorax is unchanged in overall volume, with
 slight increase in the component of pleural fluid dependent in the right lower
 chest.  Left apical pleural thickening is probably scarring.  Heart size
 normal.  Lungs hyperinflated, with mild interstitial abnormality that is
 probably chronic, but no evidence of acute cardiac decompensation or
 pneumonia.
