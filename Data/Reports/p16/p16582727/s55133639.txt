                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 11:15
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with history of pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 11:20 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There has been interval appearance of a moderate-sized left pneumothorax. 
 There is some shift of the mediastinum and flattening of the diaphragm to
 suggest a component of tension. Results were discussed at 2:03pm, 2 minutes
 after the time of discovery by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___.   The right
 lung continues to be diffusely abnormal with parenchymal opacities and
 distortion as well as some associated pleural thickening.  The left apex also
 demonstrates some post-inflammatory changes with associated distortion but
 this is also stable.  Lungs are overall hyperinflated consistent with
 underlying emphysema.  Overall cardiac contour cannot be assessed given the
 mediastinal shift and diffuse abnormality in the right lung.  There continues
 to be some subcutaneous air within the lateral chest wall tissues on the left.
