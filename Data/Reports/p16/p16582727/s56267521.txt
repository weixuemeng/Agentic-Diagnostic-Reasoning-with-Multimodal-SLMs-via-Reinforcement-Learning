                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with spontaneous
 pneumothorax, followup.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier.
 
 The current radiograph demonstrates the left pigtail catheter being in place. 
 Currently, no evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Widespread parenchymal
 opacities are demonstrated, unchanged when compared to prior studies.
