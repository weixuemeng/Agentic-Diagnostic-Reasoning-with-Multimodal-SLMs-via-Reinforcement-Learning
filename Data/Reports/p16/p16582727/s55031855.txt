                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 8 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old presented with tension pneumothorax found to
 have TB, now presenting with recurrent tension pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 8 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The left pleural pigtail catheter remains in place.  No definite left
 apical pneumothorax is seen.  There continued to be parenchymal opacity and
 distortion in the left upper lung and throughout the right lung.  The lungs
 are also hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema.  Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contour is difficult to assess given the diffuse process
 within the right hemithorax.  Some air is still seen within the lateral chest
 wall soft tissues on the left consistent with subcutaneous emphysema.
