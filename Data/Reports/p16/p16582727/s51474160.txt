                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with active TB and recurrent pneumothoraces.
 Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior studies including radiograph
 of the chest from ___ and CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates unchanged
 small left apical pneumothorax with no evidence of increased mediastinal
 shift.  Otherwise, the right lung is similar in appearance and there is no
 other relevant change.  Subcutaneous emphysema along the left lateral chest
 wall is likely due to previous chest tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable small left apical pneumothorax.
