                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of left pneumothorax, status post chest tube placement,
 evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 10:54 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the left pigtail catheter
 in the pleural space has been slightly advanced.  There is no substantial
 change in the dimension of the left pneumothorax, that is best seen in the
 apicolateral aspects of the left hemithorax.  Small air inclusions at the site
 of catheter insertion.  Minimal flattening of the left hemidiaphragm.  The
 appearance of the heart and the right lung are constant.
