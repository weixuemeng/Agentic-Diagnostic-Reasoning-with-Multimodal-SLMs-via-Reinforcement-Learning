                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumothorax status post chest tube
 placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of the left pleural pigtail catheter with marked
 decrease in size of a pneumothorax with possibly a tiny residual left apical
 component.  The mediastinum is now normally positioned.  There is an increased
 amount of subcutaneous emphysema within the lateral left chest wall tissues. 
 The left apical patchy opacity with associated distortion and the appearance
 of the entire right lung with patchy opacity and parenchymal distortion is
 stable.  Lungs remain hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable but somewhat
 difficult to assess due to diffuse abnormality in the right hemithorax.
