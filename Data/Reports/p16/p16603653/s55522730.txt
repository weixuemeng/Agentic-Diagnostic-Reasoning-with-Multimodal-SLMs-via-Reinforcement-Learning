 INDICATION:  ___F with abd pain, history of gastritis  // air under diaphragm
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi portable erect view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes account for bibasal atelectasis. In addition there is a
 right-sided pleural effusion along with additional opacities which could
 represent atelectasis but in the correct clinical setting pneumonia cannot be
 ruled out. The left lung appears relatively clear. The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged.  No pneumothorax. Chronic bilateral shoulder abnormalities are not
 fully evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right pleural effusion with additional basilar opacities which likely
 represent atelectasis. Pneumonia in the correct clinical setting cannot be
 ruled out.
