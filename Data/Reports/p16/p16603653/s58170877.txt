                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible syncope.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison made with chest radiographs from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest.  Lungs well expanded and clear.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.  There is a large diaphragmatic hernia, which
 contains at least stomach and probably bowel, as bowel was seen in this
 location on prior CT.  Degenerative changes are seen in the humeral heads
 bilaterally. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2.  Large diaphragmatic hernia containing stomach and probably bowel, as bowel
 was seen in this location on prior CT.  This puts the patient at risk for
 complicatiosn of bowel herniation.
