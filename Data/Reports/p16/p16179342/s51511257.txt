 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with influenza, dCHF, no consolidation on CXR.
 now with afib w/ rvr to ___0s.  // eval for interval change, pulmonary
 edema, new consolidation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of right atrium and right
 ventricle. Cardiomegaly is substantial, unchanged. Interstitial opacities in
 the perihilar and lower lobes are concerning for mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  Two-view right basal consolidation has slightly increased in the
 interim most likely due to progression of the edema but underlying infection
 is a possibility and assessment after diuresis is recommended
