                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post arch aneurysm repair, line position, status post change
 over wire.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with earlier the same day (7:27 a.m.), the right IJ sheath has been
 converted to a right IJ central line, with tip over distal most SVC.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
