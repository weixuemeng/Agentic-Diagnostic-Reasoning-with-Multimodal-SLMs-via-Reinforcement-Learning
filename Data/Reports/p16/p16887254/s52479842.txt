                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post aortic arch repair, left
 diaphragm plication, persistent cough and wheezing.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  Chest findings are grossly unaltered demonstrating
 status post sternotomy and prominent vascular structures in the aortic arch
 area with multiple surgical metallic clips apparently status post surgical
 repair.  A previously described cardiomegaly persists with prominence of the
 left ventricular contour.  Although the previously described mostly left-sided
 pleural densities in the form of thickening around the apex and along the
 lateral chest wall again noted but the general impression is that they have
 reduced in size and now represent more scar formations rather than remaining
 pleural effusion.  The right-sided hemithorax has not undergone any
 significant interval change and the previously described minor loculated
 pleural thickenings in the apical area, surgical clips in the right axilla and
 mild blunting of the lateral pleural sinus remains unchanged.  No new
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are seen and the pulmonary vasculature in
 the right hemithorax does not indicate any significant pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
