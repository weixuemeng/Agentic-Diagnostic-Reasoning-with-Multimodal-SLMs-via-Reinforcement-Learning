                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post aortic arch aneurysm repair.  Assess
 for interval change in pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is persistent opacification of
 the left lung base with volume loss, findings consistent with chronic
 atelectasis. Prior mild pulmonary vascular congestion has decreased in the
 interval.  A previously described relative area of ___ within the
 right upper lung has resolved and likely reflected asymmetric pulmonary edema.
 A curvilinear new opacity within the left mid lung, corresponds to pleural
 fluid layering in the fissure.  Overall, aeration of the right lung base
 appears improved.  Postoperative enlargement of the mediastinal contours
 appears slightly decreased from prior examination.  The heart size remains
 large.  Median sternotomy wires appear intact.  Surgical clips are again
 visualized in the region of the aortic arch and in the left axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Overall decreased pulmonary edema and likely smaller bilateral pleural
 effusions.
