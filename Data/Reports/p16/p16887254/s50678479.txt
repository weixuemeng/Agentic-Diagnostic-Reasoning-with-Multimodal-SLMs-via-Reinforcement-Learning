 PORTABLE PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post aneurysm repair with increasing

 Comparison to prior study dated ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest dated ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right internal jugular central line has its tip near the cavoatrial junction. 
 There is an increasing left pleural effusion, which may be somewhat loculated.
 Increasing consolidation in the left lung is seen, likely reflecting
 compressive atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
 Right lung has slightly lower volumes with streaky linear opacities at the
 base suggestive of atelectasis.  There is also some patchy opacity in the
 right upper lung with elevation of the minor fissures suggestive of partial
 right upper lobe atelectasis.  No overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax. 
 Persistent widening of the superior mediastinum in this patient status post
 aortic aneurysm repair.  Multiple surgical clips again identified status post
 median sternotomy.
