                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Arch aneurysm repair, question hypoxia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy, with an enlarged mediastinal silhouette
 including enlarged aortic arch.  The appearance is similar to ___ at 7:50
 a.m.  The Swan-Ganz catheter has been exchanged for a right IJ sheath with tip
 over proximalmost SVC.  ET and NG tubes have been removed.  A mediastinal
 drain and two left-sided chest tubes remain present.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  
 
 Compared with the earlier film, there is increased opacity in the left mid and
 lower zones, likely representing a combination of pleural fluid and collapse
 and/or consolidation.  There is upper zone redistribution, with fluid along
 the minor fissure.  On the left side, there is also mild vascular blurring. 
 There is atelectasis at the right lung base, but no right-sided consolidation
 or gross effusion.  Clips noted along the upper right chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but unchanged.
 
 2.  Increased opacity at the left base consistent with a combination of
 pleural fluid and collapse and/or consolidation, worse compared with ___.
 
 3.  Possible asymmetric interstitial edema accounting for increased vascular
 blurring on the left.
 
 4.  No pneumothorax detected.
