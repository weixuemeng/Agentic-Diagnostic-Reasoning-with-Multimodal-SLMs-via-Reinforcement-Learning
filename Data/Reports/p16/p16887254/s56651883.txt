                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with left-sided effusion, atelectasis,
 question increasing.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest dated ___ at ___ is submitted.
 On the frontal projection, the left costophrenic angle is not entirely
 included.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC near the
 cavoatrial junction.  The left pleural effusion, which likely has a loculated
 component, is stable since the previous study.  There is persistent airspace
 consolidation in the left mid and lower lung, likely representing compressive
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  In addition, patchy
 opacity at the right base is again seen, is suggestive of atelectasis.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Status post median sternotomy, persistent
 widening of the superior mediastinum in this patient status post aortic
 aneurysm repair.  Multiple surgical clips are seen overlying the aortic knob
 as well as overlying the right axillary region.  There is interval improvement
 in aeration in the right upper lung.  No pneumothorax is seen.
