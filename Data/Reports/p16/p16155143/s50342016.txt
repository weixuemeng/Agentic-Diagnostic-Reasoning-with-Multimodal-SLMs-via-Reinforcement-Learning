                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with +tob hx, fever.  // PNA? Surg: ___
 (CRPP L hip)
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Lungs are hyperinflated, in keeping
 with COPD.  Pulmonary vascular engorgement is again demonstrated, but upper
 and mid lung interstitial opacities have slightly improved, likely due to
 improved interstitial edema.  There remain, however, coarse interstitial
 opacities at the bases, in the patient is known to have fibrotic abnormalities
 in this region on prior CT.  It is uncertain whether this represents interval
 progressive fibrosis or a superimposed acute process such as edema or
 infection.  If the diagnosis is in doubt clinically, high-resolution chest CT
 may be helpful if warranted clinically.
