 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): ___ ___ ___ 7:41 AM
  
  1.  Satisfactory ET tube positioning without pneumothorax.
  2.  Findings suggest a large right hilar pulmonary mass causing post
  obstructive atelectasis.  Supervening infection and or aspiration cannot be
  excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Recommend correlation with prior
  imaging once available.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post epilepticus.  Question ET tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube terminating
 approximately 4 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube courses inferiorly out
 of view, into the stomach.  The heart is normal in size.  There is a large
 right hilar mass measuring at least 6.5 x 5.3 cm with plate like perifissural
 opacity in the right upper lobe, suggestive of post obstructive volume loss. 
 Alternatively, supervening infection and or aspiration cannot be excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  Trace left basilar atelectasis is present. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No displaced osseous injury is
 evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 2.  Findings suggest a large right hilar pulmonary mass causing post
 obstructive atelectasis.  Supervening infection and or aspiration cannot be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Recommend correlation with prior
