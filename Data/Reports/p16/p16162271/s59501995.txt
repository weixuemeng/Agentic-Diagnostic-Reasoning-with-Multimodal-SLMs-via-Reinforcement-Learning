                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer, pain in left upper
 chest with palpation and point tenderness above nipple line.  Rule out rib
 lesion or fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___ and CT torso on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  The right hilar mass is again
 seen with a confluent opacity above the minor fissure which is elevated
 slightly, this likely represents post-obstructive atelectasis or pneumonia. 
 The right paratracheal area is also full, likely from metastasis.  The left
 lung is clear.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.
 No definite rib lesions are seen on this radiograph.  However, on prior CT
 torso, a possible T4 anterior rib lesion on the left may represent metastasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right hilar mass and post-obstructive atelectasis or pneumonia is
 again seen.  No definite evidence of a rib lesion on these radiographs;
 however, on the most recent CT torso, a T4 rib lesion may be appreciated.  
 
 These findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with the covering team at 11:30
 a.m. on ___ by telephone.
