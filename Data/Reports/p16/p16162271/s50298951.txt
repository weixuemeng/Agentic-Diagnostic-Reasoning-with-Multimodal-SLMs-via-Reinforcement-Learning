 from ___.  Correlation is also made to CT from ___. 
 Compared to previous exam, there has been no significant interval change. 
 Right upper lobe, perihilar mass is essentially unchanged.  There is some less
 dense consolidation in the right upper lobe, potentially due to tumor
 extension, not significantly changed from prior.  Elsewhere, the lungs are
 clear, there is no effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as
 are the osseous and soft tissue structures.  Thickening of the right
 paratracheal stripe compatible with adenopathy as previously detailed.

 mass similar in appearance to previous exam.
