 INDICATION:    ___F with abd pain, RUQ tenderness, fatigue, fever  // PNA?
 Cholecystitis?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are relatively low.  Increased interstitial markings are seen in
 the lungs particularly in the right upper lung.  Surgical chain sutures and
 clips project just lateral to the right hilum.  Right-sided volume loss is
 noted with rightward tracheal deviation.  There is no focal consolidation. 
 Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles could be due to small effusions
 or pleural thickening.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Tortuosity with
 atherosclerotic calcifications seen in the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Postsurgical changes on the right.  Increased interstitial markings which
 could be due to chronic interstitial process versus edema.  No focal
 consolidation.  Possible small bilateral effusions or pleural thickening.
