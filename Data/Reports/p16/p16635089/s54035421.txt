                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with DM and ESRD with prior RTPX presenting with sepsis, s/p
 large debridement of L buttock gangrene ___, now s/p debridement and diverting
 colostomy ___ now w/ recurrent fevers  // intrapulmonary process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right internal jugular tunneled dialysis catheter and a left internal
 jugular vascular catheter are unchanged in position when compared to the prior
 study, the left-sided access catheter terminates at the junction of the 2
 brachiocephalic veins.  There is new elevation of the right hemi diaphragm. 
 There is prominence of the bilateral hila with bilateral patchy airspace
 opacities.  This likely reflects pulmonary edema although infection cannot be
 excluded, a more confluent area of consolidation in the left upper lobe is
 suspicious for consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with acute pulmonary edema however superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded, particularly in the left upper lobe.  Recommend continued
 attention on followup.
