                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with IDDM, bilateral BKA, left brachial-ulnar bypass, ESRD
 s/p DDRT (___, on tacrolimus and mycophenylate), now presenting with
 necrotizing fasciitis s/p wide local exicison of left gluteal wound  //
 interval cxr
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Allowing for patient rotation, cardiomediastinal contours are stable. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and asymmetric edema have slightly worsened.  A
 more confluent opacity at the left lung base may reflect atelectasis or
 potentially developing infectious consolidation in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  No other relevant changes.
