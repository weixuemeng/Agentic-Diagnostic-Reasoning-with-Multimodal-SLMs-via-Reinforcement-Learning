 Right IJ catheter tip projects over the lower SVC.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs have also

 pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are noted.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
