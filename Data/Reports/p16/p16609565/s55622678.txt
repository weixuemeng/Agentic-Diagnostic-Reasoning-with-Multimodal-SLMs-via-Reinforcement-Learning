 INDICATION:  Patient with confusion, hepatic encephalopathy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Linear opacities at the left lung base likely
 represent plate-like atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  The heart size is top normal. 
 Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
