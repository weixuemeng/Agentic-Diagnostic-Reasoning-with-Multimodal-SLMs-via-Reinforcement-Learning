                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea  // eval for effusion pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is top-normal in size. The patient is status post median sternotomy
 and CABG. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. Hazy
 ill-defined opacities seen within the left mid and lower lung fields with
 vascular indistinctness. No focal consolidative opacity is noted within the
 right mid lung field.  No pleural effusions are identified. There is no
 pneumothorax.  Clips are again noted in the left upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Focal consolidative opacity in the right mid lung field is concerning for
 pneumonia.
 2. Hazy opacity within the left mid and lower lung fields with vascular
 indistinctness could reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema though additional
 areas of pneumonia are not excluded. Recommend followup radiographs after
 diuresis for further assessment.
