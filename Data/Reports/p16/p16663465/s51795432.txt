                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever of unknown origin, rule out infection.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  There is marked cardiomegaly with straightening of the left heart
 border.  There is upper zone and probable enlargement of the main pulmonary
 artery.  There is upper zone redistribution, with slight thickening of the
 minor fissure, without other evidence of CHF.  There is focal prominence of
 vessels/interstitial markings in the right cardiophrenic region, which has
 progressed compared with the ___ film.  A small left effusion and
 equivocal trace right effusion are also new.  An electronic device is present,
 with leads over the lower cardiac silhouette, apparently a pacing device, with
 epicardial leads similar to the prior film.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution.
 
 2.  Prominence of the vessels/interstitial markings in the right cardiophrenic
 region, ? area of atelectasis.  An early area of aspiration or pneumonia would
 be difficult to exclude.  
 
 3. Suspect background COPD.
