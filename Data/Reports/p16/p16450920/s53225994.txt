                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Three months of intermittent cough, not responsive to antibiotics.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of chest imaging
 more recent than a chest CT on ___:
 
 Heart is mildly enlarged, but pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is no
 pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy.  I see no lung mass or
 direct evidence of adenopathy or consolidation, but the right hilus is
 displaced medially and inferiorly.  If clinical findings persist, a CT scan
 would be helpful in excluding a subtle right hilar mass.  It will also confirm
 whether the small hiatus hernia is present, lending additional radiodensity
 posterior to the heart on the lateral view.
