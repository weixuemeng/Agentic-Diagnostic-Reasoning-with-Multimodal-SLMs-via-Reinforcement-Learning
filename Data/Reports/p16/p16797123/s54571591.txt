                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs are
 slightly overexpanded but grossly clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.  If clinical suspicion for
 Pneumocystis infection is high, consider a high-resolution chest CT, as it is
 more sensitive than radiographs for detecting this opportunistic infection.
