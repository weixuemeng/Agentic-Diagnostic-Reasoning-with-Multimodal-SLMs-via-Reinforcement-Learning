                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough for four days.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  There is prominence of the ascending aorta vs.
 mediastinal lymph nodes as well as prominence of the right hilus, vascular vs.
 lymphadenopathy.  Lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 Given the above-described abnormalities, assessment with chest CT is required.
