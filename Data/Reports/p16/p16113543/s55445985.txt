                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with abnormal chest x-ray, increased white blood cell.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___; CT
 torso done yesterday.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Tracheostomy ends 3.5 cm above the carina.  Dobbhoff tube is in the stomach. 
 The patient is known with right apical mass invading the ribs and vertebral
 body.  Increased opacification in both lungs since yesterday is compatible
 with worsening of moderate pulmonary edema.  Bilateral moderate pleural
 effusion on the left side and severe on the right side is unchanged.  A more
 focal area around the left hilum is unchanged and could be compatible with
 loculated pleural effusion in the fissure as seen on yesterday's CT.  Right
 apical pneumonia seen on previous CT is hard to assess on this chest x-ray. 
 Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Increased opacities in both lungs are compatible with worsening of
 moderate pulmonary edema.
 2.  Right severe and left moderate pleural effusions are stable.
 3.  The patient is known with right apical mass invading adjacent bone.
 4.  Right apical pneumonia described on yesterday's CT is hard to assess on
 this exam.
