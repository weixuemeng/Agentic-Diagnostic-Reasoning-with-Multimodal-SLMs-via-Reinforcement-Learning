                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New feeding tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the Dobbhoff tube extends to
 the lower body of the stomach, then coils back on itself so that the tip lies
 in the upper stomach near the esophagogastric junction.  There is layering of
 a substantial right pleural effusion with increased opacification at the left
 base consistent with left effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe. 
 There is also an area of increased opacification in the left mid zone.  This
 and the basilar changes could represent supervening pneumonia.
