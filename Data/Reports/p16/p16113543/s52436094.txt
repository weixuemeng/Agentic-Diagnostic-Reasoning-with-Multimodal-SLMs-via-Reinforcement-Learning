                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Assessment of the patient ventilated for interval
 change.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 As compared to the prior study, the patient position has changed, being
 currently rotated to the left.  That emphasized the left pleural effusion,
 moderate to large in size, most likely unchanged in appearance but slightly
 differently distributed at that point.  Right pleural effusion is also
 present.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  No newly developed
 consolidations are noted in this patient with substantial emphysema mostly
 involving upper lungs.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The left internal
 jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  The ET tube tip is 6 cm above
 the carina.
