                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4 cm from the carina. 
 Orogastric tube courses through the stomach, with tip off the inferior borders
 of the film.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  The lungs appear hyperinflated with severe emphysematous
 changes.  A right apical area of opacification is noted, and a focal mass
 cannot be excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Cervical spinal fusion hardware is not
 completely assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Endotracheal and orogastric tubes in standard positions.
 
 2. Right apical opacity for which correlation with CT is recommended as
 finding may reflect a neoplasm. Severe emphysema.
