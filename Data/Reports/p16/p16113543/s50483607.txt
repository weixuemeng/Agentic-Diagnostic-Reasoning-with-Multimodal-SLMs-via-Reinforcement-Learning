                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:11 A.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with shortness of breath.  Evaluate pleural
 effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Greater opacification in the right lower hemithorax means that in addition to
 the moderate to large right pleural effusion and right lower lobe collapse
 there may be new consolidation in the middle lobe, previously fully aerated. 
 A smaller degree of atelectasis at the base of the left lung is unchanged. 
 The fissural pleural collection on the left is stable.  CT scan attests to
 severe emphysema.  Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.  Feeding tube ends
 in the stomach.  No pneumothorax.  At the right apex is a large tumor mass.
