 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 537 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with status post resuscitation for
 perforated duodenal ulcer, now with ARDS versus pulmonary edema, assess for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 5:40 a.m.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 537 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left internal jugular central line with its tip in the mid SVC. 
 Nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 
 Endotracheal tube with its tip 4.3 cm above the carina.  Interval improvement
 in aeration of both bases with residual small bilateral effusions and
 persistent retrocardiac opacity which may represent an area of compressive
 atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration could also have this appearance.
 Lungs appear hyperinflated suggesting a component of underlying emphysema. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
