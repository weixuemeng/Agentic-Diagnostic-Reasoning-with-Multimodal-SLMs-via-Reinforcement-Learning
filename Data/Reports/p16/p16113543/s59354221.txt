  On all images, Dobhoff catheter tip projects over the left upper quadrant,
  likely within the stomach. No other acute changes. Bilateral pleural effusions
  with underlying consolidations, likely atelectasis, and patch of left upper
  lobe opacity persist. Tracheostomy and central venous catheter are similarly
  positioned.
