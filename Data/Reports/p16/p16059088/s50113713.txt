                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of a left subclavian PICC line that coils upon itself and extends so
 that the tip points to the axilla.  Otherwise, little change in the diffuse
 bilateral pulmonary opacifications.
