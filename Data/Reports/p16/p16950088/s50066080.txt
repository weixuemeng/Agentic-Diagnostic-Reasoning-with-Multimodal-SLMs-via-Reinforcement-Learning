 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:56 PM
  Very low lung volumes slightly worse than prior.  Streaky linear atelectasis
  at the left base.  Right PICC in the mid SVC.  Consider lateral radiograph
  with better inspiration if possible for better evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in
 appearance.  Right upper lobe scarring and calcified granulomas are unchanged.
 New linear atelectasis has developed at the left base.  No new areas of
 consolidation to suggest a site of pulmonary infection, but standard PA and
 lateral views of the chest may be helpful for more complete evaluation when
 the patient's condition allows.
