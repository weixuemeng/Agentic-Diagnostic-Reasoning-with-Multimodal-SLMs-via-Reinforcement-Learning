                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia on recent chest x-ray with
 worsening respiratory status.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___, chest CT from the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  New left basal
 consolidative opacity has developed in the interim from the previous
 examination with faint right basal opacity and linear atelectasis.  Given the
 appearance of aspiration on the previous chest CT, findings are most
 suggestive of aspiration. A G-tube is incompletely assessed on the lower edge
 of the image.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left greater than right basal opacities are suggestive of
 aspiration given the similar appearance of aspiration on prior chest CT.
