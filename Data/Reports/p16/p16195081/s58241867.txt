                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known subarachnoid hemorrhage with increasing ventilator
 requirements.  Evaluate endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP supine view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position with the tip
 approximately 3.7 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric tube courses below the
 diaphragm, the tip out of the field of view.  A left subclavian central venous
 catheter is present with the tip at the cavoatrial junction.  There is
 persistent mild pulmonary edema and basilar opacities, worse on the right than
 the left.  Overall, they are not significantly changed from prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactory position of multiple lines and tubes.
 2.  Persistent mild pulmonary edema and basilar opacities, likely representing
 atelectasis.
