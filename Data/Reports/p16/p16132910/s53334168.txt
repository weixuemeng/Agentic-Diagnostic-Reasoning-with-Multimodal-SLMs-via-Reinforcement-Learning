 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post bronchoscopy and EBUS, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 substantially increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  There is the
 known 1.7-cm lung nodule at the left lung base.  No pneumothorax is observed. 
 Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette without evidence of pulmonary edema.
