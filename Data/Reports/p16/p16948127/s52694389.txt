                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with aspiration pneumonia.
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest were reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained the same day earlier.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are well aerated with
 improvement of basal opacities on the current study, most likely consistent
 with improvement of atelectasis/aspiration.  No new consolidations have
 developed.  No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
