                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with CP  // PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   On the lateral view only, there
 is retrocardiac opacity which potentially raises concern for a subtle
 pneumonia though no definite consolidation is seen on the frontal projection. 
 Please correlate clinically.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact. 
 No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent retrocardiac opacity, question pneumonia.
