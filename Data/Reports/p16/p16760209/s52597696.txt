                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 There is a large area of heterogeneous opacification involving most of the
 right lung that I hesitate to call pulmonary edema because of the asymmetry. 
 In addition, the patient has a radiographic history of asymmetric pulmonary
 abnormalities either isolated to or worse in the right lung.  There has been
 no change in moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly or borderline engorgement of
 pulmonary vasculature in the left lung.  Nonetheless, this could be extremely
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, but if it does not respond promptly to treatment,
 aspiration pneumonia would be the next most likely diagnosis.
 
 Pleural effusion is small, on the right side, if any, and probably not
 clinically significant.  Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer
 leads are in standard positions.
 
 Dr. ___ was telephoned to discuss these findings, at 2:30 p.m. and we
 discussed them at 3PM.
