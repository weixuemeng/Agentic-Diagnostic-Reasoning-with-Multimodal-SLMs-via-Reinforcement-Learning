                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with dementia, hypoxia, shortness of breath,
 and fever, question worsening infiltrate.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ and ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest dated ___ at ___ hours are
 submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Dual-lead left-sided pacer with leads terminating over the expected
 location of the right atrium and right ventricle respectively.  Stable cardiac
 enlargement with a left ventricular prominence.  Unfolded tortuous aorta. 
 Overall, the mediastinal contours are stable, with right paratracheal soft
 tissue, most likely related to prominent vascular structures.  The left lung
 remains clear.  On the right, there is a persistent patchy reticular airspace
 opacity with persistent low lung volumes.  This finding most likely represents
 an area of pneumonia or aspiration, less likely asymmetric pulmonary edema and
 appears to be slightly more confluent than on the prior study of ___. 
 The left lung is clear, but appears somewhat hyperinflated, raising concern
 for underlying emphysema.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Chronically elevated
 right hemidiaphragm of uncertain significance.  No acute bony abnormality.
