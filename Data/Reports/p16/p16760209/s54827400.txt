                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Several days of upper back pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker is noted
 with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.  The heart
 remains mildly enlarged.  New ill-defined right perihilar opacity is present,
 concerning for an infectious process, though asymmetric pulmonary edema is
 also in the differential.  Subsegmental atelectasis in the left lung base is
 present.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a trace
 right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right perihilar opacity, which could represent infection or
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Trace right pleural effusion.  Subsegmental
 atelectasis in the left lung base.
