                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF with right-sided opacity on previous study.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with a dual-channel pacer
 device remaining in place.  Some asymmetric prominence of interstitial
 markings again is consistent with pulmonary edema, though some underlying
 chronic pulmonary disease could also be considered.  There is elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm with irregularity of the margin, suggesting some
 atelectatic changes here (and at the left base) and possible small effusion.
