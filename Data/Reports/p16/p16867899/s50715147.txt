                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with PD p/w vertigo  // ?pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  As before, a broad-based
 right lateral, lower thoracic wall pleural abnormality is unchanged.  The
 lungs are clear without consolidation pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There
 is trace bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 Right pleural based abnormality is unchanged from prior examinations in could
 potentially represent pleural lipoma.  Giving the relatively short interval
 between the first radiograph in our position and the current radiograph,
 assessment with chest CT for pre size characterization is recommended.
