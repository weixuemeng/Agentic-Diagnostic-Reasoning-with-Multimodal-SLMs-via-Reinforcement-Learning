                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with chest pain.  Evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded.  The previously described ill-defined opacity
 projecting over the right anterior third rib is not clearly appreciated on
 today's exam and may previously have been the results of superimposition of
 normal structures.  Otherwise, no significant interval change from the prior
 exam.  No focal consolidation, edema, or pneumothorax.  The heart remains
 top-normal in size.  Mediastinum is not widened.  A broad-based, right lower
 thoracic wall pleural abnormality in the region of the right seventh posterior
 rib with slight asymmetric appearance of the soft tissue on the right compared
 to the left is overall unchanged.  No definite evidence of underlying rib
 fracture.  Dextroconvex scoliosis of the upper thoracic spine is mild, overall
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent right pleural-based abnormality with associated slightly
 asymmetric appearance of the overlying soft tissue in the right chest cage is
 of uncertain etiology.  Non-emergent chest CT is recommended to further
 evaluate.
 
 2.  No focal pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Dedicated non-emergent chest CT is again recommended to
 further evaluate the right pleural-based abnormality.
