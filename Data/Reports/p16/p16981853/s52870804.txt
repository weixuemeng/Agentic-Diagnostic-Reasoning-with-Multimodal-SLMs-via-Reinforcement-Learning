                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A linear opacity in the left lung base

 together with some prominent pericardial fat.  Allowing for this, no confluent
 opacities are identified.  There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  No
 pneumothorax is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Opacity at left base is thought to
 represent atelectasis/scarring and pericardial fat, best seen on ___
 abdominal CT.
