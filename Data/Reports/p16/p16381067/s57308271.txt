                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 8:38 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypoxia after a spinal fusion.  Evaluate
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging:
 
 Lung volumes are low, suggesting that the heterogeneous opacification at the
 base of the right lung is most likely atelectasis.  Vasculature in the right
 lung is minimally engorged, the left lung is perfectly clear.  Heart size is
 normal, exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Mediastinal veins are not dilated
 and pleural effusion is minimal, if any.  No pneumothorax.
