                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with increased o2 requirement and decreased
 breath sound in right base  // ? atelectasis or mucus plugging or aspiration
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph from a few hr earlier, diffuse ground-glass
 opacities in the left upper lobe and lingula have slightly improved and may
 reflect resolving hemorrhage or aspiration in the setting of the recent biopsy
 procedure.  There is otherwise no relevant change in the appearance of the
 chest since the recent study.
