                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Scapular pain x6 days, assess for pneumothorax or rib
 fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 band-like opacity in the left mid lung which is most compatible with
 atelectasis, though the possibility of a focal pneumonia is impossible to
 exclude.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 There is no displaced rib fracture.  The scapulae are suboptimally assessed,
 though no abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Band-like opacity in the left mid lung is most compatible with
 atelectasis, though pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Please correlate
 clinically.
