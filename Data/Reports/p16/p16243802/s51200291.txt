 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views the chest provided.  There is subtle elevation of

 lobe opacity which is mostly linear in appearance likely reflecting
 atelectasis or scarring though difficult to exclude a subtle pneumonia at this
 location.  Right lung is clear.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart
 size is normal.  Mediastinal contours unremarkable.  Imaged bony structures
 are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.

 Possible left lower lobe pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
