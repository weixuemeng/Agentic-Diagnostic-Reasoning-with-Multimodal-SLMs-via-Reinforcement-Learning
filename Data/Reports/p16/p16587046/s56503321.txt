                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with pneumonia  // Eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are again seen on the current exam.  Increased opacity at the
 lung bases particularly on the lateral may be secondary to atelectasis given
 lower lung volumes, the frontal view is relatively clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam.  Bibasilar opacities particularly on the lateral view could
 represent atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes although infection is
 not excluded.
