                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Acute pain over right posterior lower ribs.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance.  Lungs are essentially
 clear.  No rib abnormalities demonstrated within the limitations of the study
 technique.  If clinically warranted, correlation with dedicated rib views
 might be considered.
