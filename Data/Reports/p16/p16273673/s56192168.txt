                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Relatively low lung volumes may account for
 the mild prominence of the cardiac silhouette.  No evidence of vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.  Minimal atelectatic
 streaks are seen at the left base.  Suggestion of a slight impression on the
 left side of the lower cervical trachea raises the possibility of thyroid
 enlargement.
