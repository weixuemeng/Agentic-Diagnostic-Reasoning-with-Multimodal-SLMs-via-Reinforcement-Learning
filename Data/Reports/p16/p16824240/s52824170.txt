                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Findings are
 similar to prior.  There is diffuse increased interstitial markings
 bilaterally, worse in the mid-to-lower lung but seen diffusely throughout the
 lungs, worrisome for chronic interstitial lung disease.  Acute-on-chronic
 process is not excluded in the mid-to-lower lung fields.  However, findings
 are similar to prior.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally, suggesting
 chronic interstitial lung disease similar to prior, with prominence in the
 mid-to-lower lung.  A more acute component in the mid-to-lower lung fields is
 not excluded although appears similar to prior.
