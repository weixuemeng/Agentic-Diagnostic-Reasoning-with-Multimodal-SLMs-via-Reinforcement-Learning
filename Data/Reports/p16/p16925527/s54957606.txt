 FINDINGS:
 
 And approximately 1 cm rounded opacity projecting over the right mid lung
 likely corresponds to patient's previously seen pulmonary nodule, grossly
 stable given differences in technique although CT is more sensitive.  No focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary
 edema is seen.
