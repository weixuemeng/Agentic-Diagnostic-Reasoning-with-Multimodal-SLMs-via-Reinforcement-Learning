                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear stable.  Blunting of posterior costophrenic sulci suggests a trace
 pleural effusion, at least on the right side, but possibly bilateral.  Mild
 pleural thickening at each lung apex appears unchanged.  The lungs appear
 otherwise clear.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings which may suggest trace pleural effusion; otherwise
 unremarkable.
