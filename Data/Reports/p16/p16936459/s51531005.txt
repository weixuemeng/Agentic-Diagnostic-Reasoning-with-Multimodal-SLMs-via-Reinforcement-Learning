                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with 4 days cough, wheezing , T 101 last night. 
 Bibasilar rhochin, end-exp wheezes.  // r/o PNA     r/o PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower than before, and atelectasis and vascular crowding may
 account for some of the opacification at the right lung base, but a small
 pneumonia is just as likely.
 
 There are also 2 possible lung nodule. One, ___ x 15 mm, projects over the
 anterior aspect of the right fifth rib and could be the right nipple. The
 second is nearly 18 mm wide, projecting over the right cardiophrenic sulcus,
 could be a superimposition of normal vessels. Therefore I recommend that after
 the patient is treated for the  lung infection, he have repeat chest
 radiographs in ___ weeks and encourage him to take a deep breath for the study
 so that we can see if these lung nodules are real. The examination should be
 shown to a chest radiologist before the patient leaves the department to see
 if oblique views are necessary.
 
 Heart is normal size. There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement or edema or
 pleural effusion. .
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Pertinent critical findings were posted by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 12:30 to the Department of Radiology online critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
