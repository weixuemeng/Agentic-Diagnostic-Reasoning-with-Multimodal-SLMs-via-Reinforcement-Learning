                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia versus pulmonary edema, in a patient with
 urosepsis, hypoactive delirium with a 3 L oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable upright frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a right PICC
 terminating in the low SVC.  Lung volumes remain low, with extremely limited
 visualization of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  There is unchanged mild
 pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis.  No new focal consolidation or
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable, other than lower abdominal tubes which are
 incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistently low lung volumes, with unchanged mild pulmonary edema and
 atelectasis.  No new focal consolidation identified.
