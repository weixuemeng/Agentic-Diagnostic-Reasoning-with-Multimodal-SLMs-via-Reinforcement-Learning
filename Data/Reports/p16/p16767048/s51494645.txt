                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness, active cancer
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Cardiac silhouette size is not enlarged.  The aorta is
 mildly tortuous. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present without
 overt pulmonary edema. Linear opacities in the lung bases, more so on the
 left, are compatible with areas of subsegmental atelectasis. No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No areas of focal consolidation or
 demonstrated. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.  Extensive
 degenerative changes are seen involving the left glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
