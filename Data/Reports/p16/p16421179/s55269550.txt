                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for presence of pulmonary edema in patient with a
 history of asthma, being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia, presenting
 with rhonchi and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  A series of chest radiographs from ___ dating back to
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A bedside AP radiograph of the chest depicts stable mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion, without evidence of frank edema.  Moderate right and
 small left pleural effusions are stable.  Since ___, there has been
 persistent opacification of the left lower lobe.  Marked right lower lobe
 atelectasis is also unchanged.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is a chronic finding, along with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta
 and calcifications of the aortic arch.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement without evidence of pulmonary edema.
 2.  Stable bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with
 accompanying bibasilar atelectasis.  In the right clinical setting, pneumonia
 within the lower lobes cannot be excluded.
