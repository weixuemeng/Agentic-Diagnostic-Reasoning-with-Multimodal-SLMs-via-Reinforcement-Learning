 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the epicardial leads appear
 well situated and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Opacification at the
 left base is consistent with pleural fluid and atelectatic changes.
 The pulmonary vessels are increasingly indistinct, suggesting some elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.
