                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M intubated  // eval ETT position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright AP image of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same
 day, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube is in adequate position. The NG tube is in adequate position.
 
 There is mild pulmonary edema, right greater than left.  Emphysema is likely. 
 Greater right upper pleural thickening on the costal and mediastinal surfaces
 compared with prior exams suggests local tumor recurrence, perhaps involving
 mediastinal nodes and right hilus impinging on the bronchial tree. No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. ET tube and NG tube in appropriate positions.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema, right greater than left.
 
 3.  Chest CT would help assess possible right hilar, mediastinal and pleural
 tumor recurrence.
 
 4.  Emphysema.
