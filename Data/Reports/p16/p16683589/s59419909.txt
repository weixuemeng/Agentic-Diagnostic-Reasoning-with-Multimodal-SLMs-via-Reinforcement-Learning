                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:37 A.M. ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with right posterior rib fractures and a small
 hemopneumothorax.  Evaluate for worsening injury.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 5:05 and 7:07 a.m.:
 
 Differences in radiographic projection make it difficult to assess whether the
 apparent wide and increasing separation of multiple right posterior rib
 fractures is genuine, but the degree of separation puts the patient at high
 risk for laceration of intercostal artery or vein.  Nevertheless, the extent
 of extrapleural bleeding if any is small, and there is no pleural effusion. 
 Right lung is low in volume, but there is no discrete atelectasis.  Left lung
 is entirely clear.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable but better assessed
 by CT scanning.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size top normal, unchanged.
 
 Right subclavian line ends in the right atrium.
