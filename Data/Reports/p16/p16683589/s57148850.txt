 HISTORY:  Acute trauma from motor vehicle accident, including multiple right

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 No evidence of increased extrapleural bleeding despite multiple displaced
 right upper posterior rib fractures.  Change in contour of the right
 diaphragmatic surface and greater opacity at the right base are probably due
 to increased small right pleural effusion.  Lungs are clear.  The heart is top
 normal size and unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
