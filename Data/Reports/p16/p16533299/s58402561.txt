                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recent SBO, assess for free air.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low somewhat limiting the evaluation.  Slightly elevated right hemidiaphragm
 is noted.  There has been interval removal of the left arm PICC line. 
 Multiple surgical clips are again noted at the expected location of the GE
 junction.  No definite sign of free air below the right hemidiaphragm.  There
 is bibasilar atelectasis.  Slight prominence of the right pulmonary hilum
 appears stable, though this likely represents technique.  Consider dedicated
 PA and lateral views to better assess.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam demonstrating bibasilar atelectasis, slight fullness
 of the right pulmonary hilum.  No definite sign of free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.  To resolve the apparent right hilar prominence, consider
 dedicated PA and lateral views with more optimized inspiratory effort.
