                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SOB and tachypnea in the setting of recent
 ARDS.  // Interval change?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach. Left-sided PICC line tip is at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Lung volumes are low with volume loss at the bases. 
 There is hazy increased opacity in the retrocardiac region that could
 represent an infiltrate. This is slightly more prominent than on the prior
 studies. In addition the right hilum appears very prominent but this is felt
 to be projectional there is a small right lower lobe opacity that could be due
 to volume loss versus early infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight worse appearance to the lower lungs. Is unclear if this is all due to
 volume loss surface there is an underlying infectious infiltrate.
