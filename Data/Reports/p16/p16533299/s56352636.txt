                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with abdominal and chest pain, back pain, history of
 small bowel obstruction, diverticulitis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  No pulmonary edema is present. Patchy and linear opacities in the
 lung bases are similar compared to the previous exam and may reflect a
 combination of chronic interstitial abnormality and atelectasis.  No new focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Numerous clips are
 demonstrated at the gastroesophageal junction. No subdiaphragmatic free air is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No subdiaphragmatic free air identified.  Patchy and linear bibasilar
 opacities, not substantially changed from the prior study, and potentially
 reflect mild chronic interstitial abnormality and atelectasis.
