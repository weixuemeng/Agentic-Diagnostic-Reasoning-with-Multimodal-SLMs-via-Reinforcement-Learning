 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  Linear bibasilar opacities most likely
 represent atelectasis.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 Heart size is normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Biapical pleural
 thickening is stable.  Multiple surgical clips project over mid abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Linear bibasilar opacities, most consistent with
 atelectasis.
