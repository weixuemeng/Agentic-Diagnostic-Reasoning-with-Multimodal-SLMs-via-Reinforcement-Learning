                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall  // eval for fx/bleed
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Again seen is moderate cardiomegaly with central vascular congestion,
 cephalization, and moderate interstitial edema.  There are probable small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar atelectasis and retrocardiac
 atelectasis is noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fracture is
 identified.  Redemonstrated is diffuse osseous demineralization with
 compression deformity involving several lower thoracic vertebral bodies
 causing focal kyphosis, similar to the prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion with small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  No acute rib fracture.  Demineralization and compression deformities of
 several lower thoracic vertebral bodies with focal kyphosis is similar to the
 prior examination.
