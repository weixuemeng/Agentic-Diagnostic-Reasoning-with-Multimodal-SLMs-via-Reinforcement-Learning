                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob
 calcifications are noted.  Left-sided indentation upon the trachea may be due
 to a left thyroid goiter or nodule.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities in the
 lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  Infection is not excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.  Trace left pleural effusion is not excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar patchy airspace opacities,
 possibly atelectasis though infection is not excluded.  A small left pleural
 effusion also may be present.
