                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Flash pulmonary edema with atrial fibrillation,
 followup.
 
 AP chest radiograph
 
 As compared to ___, the patient has been extubated with removal
 of the NG tube.  Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged.  Prominence
 of pulmonary arteries is consistent most likely with pulmonary hypertension. 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema on the current radiograph, only mild
 vascular engorgement in the upper lungs.  The right PICC line tip is at the
 level of cavoatrial junction.  Small amount of pleural effusion is noted.
