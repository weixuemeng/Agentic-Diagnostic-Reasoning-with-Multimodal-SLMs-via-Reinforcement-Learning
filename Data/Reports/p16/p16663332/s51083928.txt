                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p MVC
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso obtained same day ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single supine portable radiograph through the chest was obtained. External
 trauma board somewhat limits evaluation. Lung volumes are low bilaterally. No
 focal consolidation is identified. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits. No large pleural effusion is seen.  The right apex is
 out of the field of view.  Allowing for this, no pneumothorax is seen. Osseous
 structures are without acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic abnormality identified.  Please note that chest
 radiograph is an inadequate modality in the setting of chest trauma and high
 suspicion for traumatic injury.
