                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion suggesting heart failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  In view of the relatively
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion, the possibility of cardiomyopathy or
 pericardial effusion should be considered.  Small effusions are seen
 bilaterally.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
