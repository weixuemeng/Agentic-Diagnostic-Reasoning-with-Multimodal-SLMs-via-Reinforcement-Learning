                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the pulmonary vascular
 congestion has cleared.  Persistent opacification at the left base which
 appears to be increasing is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and
 pleural effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia in the right lung or upper half of the
 left lung.
