                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of renal carcinoma with diarrhea and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Fluoroscopy during a port placement from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single portable upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided Port-A-Cath is present with the tip likely at or just
 beyond the atriocaval junction.  Surgical clips are present in the left apex. 
 The lungs appear slightly hyperinflated, consistent with emphysema.  There is
 no focal airspace consolidation or pulmonary edema.  There are post surgical
 changes in the left hemithorax with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and
 pleural thickening.  There is no right pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac size is difficult to evaluate given the post
 surgical changes.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  Calcifications are
 noted within the aortic arch and the descending aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Post-surgical changes of the left hemi-thorax.  No evidence of
 pneumonia or acute cardiopulmonary process.
