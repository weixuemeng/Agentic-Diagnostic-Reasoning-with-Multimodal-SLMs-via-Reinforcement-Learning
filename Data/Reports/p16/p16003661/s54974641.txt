  1. Endotracheal tube terminates 2.9 cm from the carina.
  2. Enteric tube terminates at the GE junction and should be advanced for
  optimal placement.
  3. Interval increase in small left pleural effusion.
  4. Grossly unchanged masslike opacification of the left midlung, previously
  evaluated by CT at which time biopsy was recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with copd in resp distress intubated, evaluate endotracheal
 tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The new endotracheal tube terminates 3.9 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube
 terminates at the level of the GE junction and should be advanced for optimal
 placement within the stomach.  A small left pleural effusion is increased in
 size compared with the prior study.
 
 Left mid lung masslike opacification has increased in density compared to
 prior studies and better characterized by CT of ___. 
 Hyperinflation is similar to multiple prior studies.  There is no new focal
 consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates 2.9 cm from the carina.
 2. Enteric tube terminates at the GE junction and should be advanced for
 optimal placement.
 3. Interval increase in small left pleural effusion.
 4. Slightly increased in density masslike opacification of the left midlung,
 previously evaluated by CT at which time biopsy was recommended.  The re-
 assessment with chest CT for inspecting of the chest wall invasion is to be
 considered if clinically warranted.
