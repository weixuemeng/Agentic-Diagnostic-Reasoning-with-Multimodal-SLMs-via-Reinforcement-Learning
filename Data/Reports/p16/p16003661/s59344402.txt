                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD and CHF with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates hyperexpanded
 lungs with a stable relative opacification of the lung bases likely
 exaggerated by hyperlucencies in the upper lung zones.  No focal opacification
 concerning for pneumonia identified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
 Atherosclerotic changes noted in the aortic arch.  No compression fracture
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Hyperexpanded lungs consistent
 with provided diagnosis of COPD. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
