                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  The opaque portion of the Dobbhoff tube straddles the
 esophagogastric junction.  This should be pushed forward several cm.
 
 Remainder of the study is essentially unchanged, though there does appear to
 be some decreased opacification at the right base that could reflect improving
 effusion or merely change in patient position.
