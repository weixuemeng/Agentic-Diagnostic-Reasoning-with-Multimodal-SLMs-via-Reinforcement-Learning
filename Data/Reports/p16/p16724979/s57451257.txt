                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with respiratory insufficiency.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT scan of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The tracheostomy is in adequate position.  Left-sided subclavian line ends in
 the mid SVC.  Bilateral ground-glass and airspace consolidation are unchanged.
 The mediastinal contour is normal. Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is very mild pleural effusion if any.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  The lines and tubes are in adequate position.
 
 2.  Stable important bilateral ground-glass and airspace opacities probably
 caused by a mix of pulmonary edema, infection and atelectasis.
