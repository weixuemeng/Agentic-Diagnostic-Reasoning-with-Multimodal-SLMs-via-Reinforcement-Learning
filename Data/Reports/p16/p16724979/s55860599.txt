                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post tracheobronchoplasty.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The carina itself is not well visualized, ?  due to opacification or overlying
 structures.  The ET tube tip probably lies approximately 3-3.5 cm above the
 carina.  An NG tube is present -- the distal portion is not visualized and
 cannot be localized.  A left subclavian central line is present, tip over
 SVC/RA junction.  A right PICC line is present, tip poorly visualized,but
 likely overlying distal SVC.  No obvious pneumothorax. 
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, diffuse vascular blurring, and diffuse,
 somewhat patchy, alveolar opacities in both mid and lower zones.  Costophrenic
 angles are excluded from the film, limiting assessment for small effusions. 
 Tiny clip overlies the right upper lung, unchanged.   
 
 Compared with ___ at 6:12 a.m., presumed CHF findings are slightly worse. 
 The cariomediastinal silouette is prominent, but unchanged. ? trace
 penumomediastinum, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) CHF, overall unchanged. Possibility of an underlying pneumonic infiltrate
 cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 2) Poor visualization of the lower trachea.
 
 3) Position of NG tube tip cannot be confirmed.  Please see comment. 
 
 If clinically indicated, a repeat chest x-ray with increased penetration and
 inclusion of the diaphragms could be obtained at no additional charge to the
 patient.
