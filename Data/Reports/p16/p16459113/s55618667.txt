                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and moderately well-aerated lungs.  Interstitial abnormality, left
 lower lobe greater than right, is noted.  There is no appreciable pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetric interstitial abnormality, left greater than right, without
 cardiomegaly or pleural effusion.  Atypical pneumonia is favored over
 asymmetrical pulmonary edema.
