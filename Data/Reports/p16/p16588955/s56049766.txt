 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is borderline enlarged, but is likely accentuated
 due to slightly low lung volumes.  Mediastinal hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Lungs are clear and the pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
