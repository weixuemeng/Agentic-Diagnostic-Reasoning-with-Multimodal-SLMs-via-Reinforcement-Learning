 early infectious process.  Possible small right pleural effusion.  No evidence
 of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath remains in place.
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  An intramedullary
 rod with screws is seen in the incompletely visualized proximal humerus.  No
 acute bony abnormality is appreciated.
