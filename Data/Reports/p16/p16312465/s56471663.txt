                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma; postop day pattern status post left humeral
 fracture repair with persistent low-grade temperature.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal with unremarkable cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contour.  A right subclavian infusion port is unchanged in position with the
 catheter tip projecting over the right atrium.  Again appreciated are linear
 opacities in the right lower lung and left mid lung likely representative of
 atelectasis along with an elliptical consolidation in the left mid lung likely
 representing change in configuration of atelectasis otherwise without effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Left humeral head fixation hardware is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent atelectasis without evidence of pneumonia.
