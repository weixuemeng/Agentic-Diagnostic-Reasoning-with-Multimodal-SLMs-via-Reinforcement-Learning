 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma, new fever.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The radiograph is compared to ___.  The pre-existing
 subtle opacities at the bases of the right lung have completely resolved. 
 However, better seen than on the previous image, is a very subtle opacity at
 the bases of the right upper lobe as well as in the left perihilar regions. 
 Previously non-visible on the frontal radiograph are bilateral small pleural
 effusions, visible on the lateral radiograph only.  The findings raise
 suspicion for early pneumonia.  CT should be performed to either confirm or
 exclude this diagnosis.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, 10:20 a.m., on ___, the
 referring physician, ___. ___, covered by Dr. ___, was paged for
 notification.  Findings were discussed one minute later over the telephone.
