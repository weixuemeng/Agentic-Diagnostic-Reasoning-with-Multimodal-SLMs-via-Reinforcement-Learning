                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with neutropenic fever, assess pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath unchanged in position.  No interval change in streaky
 opacity in the left mid lung and at the right base suggestive of atelectasis
 rather than an acute infectious process.  Clinical correlation, however, is
 advised.  No large effusions.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  An intramedullary rod
 with multiple screws is once again identified within the left proximal
 humerus.
