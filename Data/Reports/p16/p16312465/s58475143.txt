  The lung volumes are decreased, accentuating the bronchovascular structures.
  Increased density at the right lower lobe adjacent to the heart is felt to
  reflect atelectasis versus superimposed bronchovascular structures. However if
  clinical concern, PA and lateral views are recommended to exclude an
  infectious process. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle, could relate to a
  small pleural effusion. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Discussed
  with Dr. ___ by ___ via phone on ___ at 12:10 AM.

 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multiple myeloma, new O2 requirement, ?
 etiology  // ___ year old woman with multiple myeloma, new O2 requirement, ?
 etiology
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is a right subclavian central line with the distal lead tip at the
 cavoatrial junction, stable. The lung volumes are decreased, accentuating the
 bronchovascular structures. Increased density at the right lower lobe adjacent
 to the heart is felt to reflect atelectasis versus superimposed
 bronchovascular structures. However if clinical concern, PA and lateral views
 are recommended to exclude an infectious process. Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle, could relate to a small pleural effusion. There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
