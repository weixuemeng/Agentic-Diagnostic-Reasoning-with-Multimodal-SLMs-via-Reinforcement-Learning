                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall with right wrist tenderness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vascularity is not
 engorged.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures is present with multilevel
 degenerative changes seen throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
