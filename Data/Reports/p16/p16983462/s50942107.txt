                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness, numbness  // ICH
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal, but unchanged. Mild calcification
 and unfolding of the aorta is present, similar in configuration to the prior
 study. No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is detected.  Rounded density
 measuring approximately ___.7 mm, at the right base is probably artifact
 related to the anterior rib end or possibly a calcified granuloma. Incidental
 note is made of mild curvature of the thoracic spine and background
 degenerative changes. Slight pleural parenchymal scarring at the right lung
 apex is unchanged.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute pulmonary process identified. Question artifact versus calcified
 granuloma at right lung base.
