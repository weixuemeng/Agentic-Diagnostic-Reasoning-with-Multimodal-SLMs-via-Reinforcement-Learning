 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with diabetes, hypertension,HDL
 increase, history of lower right-sided chest wall pain, evaluate for
 intrathoracic process, etiology of right lower chest wall pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Evaluation is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding chest examination ___ ___.  The heart size is mildly
 enlarged.  No typical configurational abnormality can be identified.  The
 thoracic aorta is of ordinary ___ and not elongated but some small
 calcium deposits are seen in the wall at the level of the arch.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal
 infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are
 free.  No pneumothorax in the apical area on the frontal views.  Skeletal
 structures of the thorax are grossly within normal limits.  No evidence of
 vertebral body compression.
 
 When comparison is made with the next previous chest examination, the findings
 are unaltered.  Thus, the radiographic examination of the chest cannot
 identify the patient's specific right-sided thoracic chest pain.
