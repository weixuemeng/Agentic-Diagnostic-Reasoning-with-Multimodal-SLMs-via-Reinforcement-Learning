                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of CABG, status post chest tube removal.  Please evaluate
 for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is again seen mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  There has been
 interval removal of an ET tube.  Right internal jugular vein terminates in the
 mid-to-low SVC.  Note is made of mild bibasilar atelectasis as well as mild
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.  The lung volumes are low which explains the
 crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature.  No overt signs of
 interstitial or alveolar edema is present. No evidence of a pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post removal of a left-sided chest tube without evidence
 of a pneumothorax.  Stable mild bibasilar atelectasis.
