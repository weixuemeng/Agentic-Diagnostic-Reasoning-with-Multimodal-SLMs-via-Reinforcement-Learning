                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 2:41 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with ileus.  Nasogastric tube advanced 9 cm into
 the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to limited chest radiograph of the torso at
 4:53 a.m. today:
 
 Pneumoperitoneum reflects recent abdominal surgery.  Nasogastric tube has been
 advanced to the mid portion of the stomach.  Most of the heterogeneous
 opacification in the lungs has cleared; the remainder at the left lung base is
 either atelectasis or residual aspiration.  What was questioned as a
 peripheral lung lesion in the right lower lung (and as such possible pulmonary
 infarction) maintains a constant relationship with the anterior aspect of the
 right fifth rib and is presumably a healed fracture or pleural thickening from
 a remote injury.
