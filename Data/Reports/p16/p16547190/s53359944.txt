                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with p/w with worsening renal function, confusion,
 and new oxygen requirement  // Pulmonary edema? Pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 There are low lung volumes causing bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Lingular scar appears similar to prior.  There is a
 left chest cardiac device with lead tips in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Cardiomegaly is mild. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No
 free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Adjacent basilar lung opacities probably reflect atelectasis but coexisting
 pneumonia is not fully excluded.
