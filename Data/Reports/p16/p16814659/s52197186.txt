                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with acute onset chest pain.  Evaluate for
 aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded and clear.  No focal consolidation, edema,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart is top-normal in size.  The thoracic
 aorta is unchanged from the prior study when consideration is given to slight
 patient rotation.  No acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary radiographic abnormality.  Note that aortic
 dissection may be present in the absence of chest radiographic findings. 
 Therefore, and this diagnosis is entertained clinically, dedicated chest CTA
 would be recommended, if warranted clinically.
