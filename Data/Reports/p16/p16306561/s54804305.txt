                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia and fever.  Evaluate for aspiration or infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP view of the chest.  The right right-sided port ends in the upper SVC.  A
 new left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity may represent aspiration or pneumonia
 or atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Vague retrocardiac opacity most likely atelectasis, however aspiration or
 pneumonia cannot be ruled out.
