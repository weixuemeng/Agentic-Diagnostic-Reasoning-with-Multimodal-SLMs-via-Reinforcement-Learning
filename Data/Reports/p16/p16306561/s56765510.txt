                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with rising leukocytosis on broad spec abx for
 bacterial peritonitis  // assess for intrapulm process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the frontal image is unchanged. The
 lateral image, however, shows a mild left pleural effusion, restricted to the
 area of the dorsal costophrenic sinus, as well as an adjacent parenchymal
 opacity, likely atelectatic in origin.  The change could be a consequence of
 the clinically known peritonitis. However, short term radiographic followup is
 required to rule out coexisting pneumonia.
 
 Unchanged appearance of the right lung and of the cardiac silhouette.
