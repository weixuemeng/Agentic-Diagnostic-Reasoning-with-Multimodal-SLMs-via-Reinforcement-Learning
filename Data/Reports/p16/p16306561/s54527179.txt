                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 938 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cirrhosis and shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 237.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 938 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a feeding tube which courses below the diaphragm and
 the tip is not identified.  Right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in
 position.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There are
 increasing effusions, now seen bilaterally, left greater than right.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  There are patchy bibasilar opacities likely
 reflecting compressive atelectasis in the setting of an effusion, although an
 infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.  No pneumothorax.
