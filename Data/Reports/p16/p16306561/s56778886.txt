                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with abdominal pain and vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a right-sided PICC seen with tip terminating over the cavoatrial
 junction.  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm consistent with
 volume loss.  There has been interval progression of bilateral pleural
 effusions when compared to the prior exam.  Patchy bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect compressive atelectasis, although superimposed infection is not
 entirely excluded.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  Osseous structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in bilateral effusions with bibasilar opacities
 that likely reflect atelectasis, although infection is not entirely excluded.
