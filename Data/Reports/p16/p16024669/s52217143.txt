  The ET tube is in satsifactory position 4.3 cm from the carina.  The OG tube
  tip is in the stomach.  The side port of the tube is difficult to visualize. 
  Otherwise little change, including minimal vascular congestion, a moderate
  right pleural effusions, and bibasilar opacities, most likely atelectasis.

 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 4.3 cm above the carina, and
 nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  Stable cardiomegaly accompanied
 by slight worsening of pulmonary vascular congestion and mild perihilar edema.
 Moderate right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusions with adjacent
 lower lobe opacities appear similar allowing for positional differences
 between the studies.
