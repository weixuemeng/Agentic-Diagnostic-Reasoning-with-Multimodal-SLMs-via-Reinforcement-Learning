 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable cardiomegaly, but slight improvement in pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Perihilar haziness and peribronchial cuffing have also slightly
 improved. Asymmetrically distributed consolidation with right perihilar and
 lower lobe predominance likely represents a pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Followup radiographs would be helpful to document
 resolution.  Adjacent small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is noted.
