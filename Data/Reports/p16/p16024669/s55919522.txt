                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of a moderate size right
 pleural effusion, which has increased compared to the prior exam.  The
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, but this appears somewhat improved compared to the previous exam. 
 Right basilar opacity may reflect compressive atelectasis, though infection
 cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.  No left-sided pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval increase in size of moderate right pleural effusion.  Right
 basilar opacity likely reflects compressive atelectasis though infection is
 difficult to exclude.
 
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, improved compared to the previous exam.
