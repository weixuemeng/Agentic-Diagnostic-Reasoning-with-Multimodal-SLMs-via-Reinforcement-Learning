 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for right-sided pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pleural effusion
 has minimally decreased in extent and provides now an improved visualization
 of the right heart border.  However, the overall extent of the effusion
 remains substantial.  There is no evidence for the presence of a right
 pneumothorax.  The heart remains moderately enlarged.  The left lung is
 unremarkable.
