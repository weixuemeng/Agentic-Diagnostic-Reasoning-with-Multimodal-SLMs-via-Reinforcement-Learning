                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cirrhosis and right pleural effusion still requiring
 oxygen.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:
 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again seen.  An air bronchogram is
 seen behind the left heart.  This has been present on prior chest x-rays. 
 Size of the right effusion and collapsed right lower lobe is essentially
 unchanged since the prior chest x-ray.  However, on today's film, there is
 suggestion of an air bronchogram on the left and consolidation in this region
 may be present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe consolidation may be present, which was not
 present at the time of the CT of ___.
