  1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
  2. Marked bronchial wall thickening, which can be seen in the setting of small
  airways disease.  Recommend correlation with prior studies and clinical
  symptoms.
  3. No acute fracture identified. If there is persistent clinical concern for a
  rib fracture, dedicated rib series should be obtained in the area of focal
  tenderness.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M s/p assault, main problem is L orbital fracture but
 has some tenderness  // acute intrathoracic process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Left
 retrocardiac opacity most likely represents atelectasis.  There is central
 bronchial wall thickening which is a nonspecific finding but raises the
 possibility of small airways disease.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities identified.  Specifically, no displaced rib
 fractures seen.  However, if this is of clinical concern, a dedicated rib
 series should be considered.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Central bronchial wall thickening which
 may reflect small airways disease.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
