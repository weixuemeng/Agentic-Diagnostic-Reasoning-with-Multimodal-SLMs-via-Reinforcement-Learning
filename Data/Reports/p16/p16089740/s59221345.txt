                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Elective intubation.  Evaluation of placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recently on ___ at 11:09 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is rotated to the left. The ET tube terminates
 approximately 5 cm above the carina.  There is no pneumothorax.  An NG tube
 courses below the diaphragm and terminates outside the field of view.  The
 left PICC terminates in the low SVC.
 
 Differences in the the left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis are
 difficult to ascertain due to patient positioning.  There may be volume loss
 at the left lung base, which would be reflect worsening left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible worsening left lower lobe atelectasis.  Recommend
 repeating portable radiograph with adjusted patient positioning.
 
 Findings discussed with MICU resident.
