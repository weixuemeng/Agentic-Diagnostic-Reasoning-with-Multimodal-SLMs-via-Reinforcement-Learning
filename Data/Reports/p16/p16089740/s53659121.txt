                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative with incidental pleural effusion, to assess for
 change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, allowing for differences in
 position, there is probably little change in the extent of the left pleural
 effusion which is producing a meniscus in the region of the costophrenic
 angle.  Compressive atelectasis is seen at the left base.
 
 The endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed.  Central catheter
 remains in place.
