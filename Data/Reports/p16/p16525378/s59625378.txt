                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior exam, the mild pulmonary edema has resolved. Linear opacities
 at the bilateral bases most likely represent atelectasis.  There is no
 evidence of a focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  A
 coarse calcification overlying the right apex is unchanged, and possibly a
 calcified thyroid nodule. A right diaphragmatic eventration is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
