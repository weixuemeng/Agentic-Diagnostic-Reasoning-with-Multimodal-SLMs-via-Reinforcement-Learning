                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with thyroid storm and respiratory failure
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent

 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There are diffuse increased ground-glass
 opacities throughout both lungs, findings likely secondary to increasing
 non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Endotracheal tube and left approach central
 venous catheter are in unchanged position.  There has been interval removal of
 a right internal jugular central venous catheter.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits and unchanged.  Aeration of the lungs though
 slightly worse compared to most recent prior is still significantly improved
 as compared to chest radiograph from ___ at 8:09 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Standard position of support devices.  Increasing diffuse
 pulmonary edema, now moderate.
