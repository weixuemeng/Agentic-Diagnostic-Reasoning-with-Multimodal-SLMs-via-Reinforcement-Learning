                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure status post intubation at outside hospital.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 8:03 and 13:15.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is low lying, terminating approximately 1 cm from the
 carina, and should be withdrawn.  An enteric tube is seen with tip in the
 stomach.  The right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in
 the mid SVC.  The heart remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Worsening diffuse alveolar opacities are present, with probable
 minimal bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There is
 no acute osseous abnormality seen.  Multiple clips in the right upper quadrant
 of the abdomen denote prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Low lying endotracheal tube with tip terminating 1 cm from the carina.
 
 2. Enteric tube within the stomach.
 
 3. Worsening diffuse alveolar opacities compatible with ARDS.  Probable trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.
