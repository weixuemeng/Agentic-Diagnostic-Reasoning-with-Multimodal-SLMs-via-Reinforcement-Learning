                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of respiratory failure.  Assess for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates interval removal of
 endotracheal tube.  Low lung volumes accentuate bronchovascular markings. 
 Left costophrenic angle is not fully included on this exam, however, a small
 left pleural effusion is likely.  Retrocardiac consolidation likely reflects
 atelectasis.  Mild perihilar vascular congestion is noted.  Right lung is
 clear without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lung base consolidation, most likely atelectasis with associated likely
 small left pleural effusion.
