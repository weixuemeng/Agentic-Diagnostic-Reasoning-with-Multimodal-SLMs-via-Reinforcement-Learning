                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left hemothorax, now with chest tube removal, please assess for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
 mediastinal, hilar and cardiac contours.  There is increased density of the
 left hemithorax compared to yesterday which may indicate layering effusion,
 however, given degree of increased density finding is concerning for
 reaccumulating hemothorax.  Faint opacities are noted within the left lower
 lung likely reflect atelectasis though infectious process cannot be excluded. 
 Given timeframe from initial trauma, these are unlikely to represent pulmonary
 contusions.  Multiple minimally displaced left-sided rib fractures are
 identified including a segmental fracture of the posterior sixth rib.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 Increased density of left hemithorax may represent large layering effusion but
 is concerning for reaccumulation of known hemothorax.
