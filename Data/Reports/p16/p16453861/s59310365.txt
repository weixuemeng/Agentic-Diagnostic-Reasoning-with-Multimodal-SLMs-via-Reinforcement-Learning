                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fevers.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lungs are well-expanded.  Opacity anterior to the spine on the lateral view is
 of unclear etiology and could be further characterized with oblique views of
 the chest.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Likely no acute cardiopulmonary process, however recommend oblique chest
 radiographs to rule out pathology related to the visualized opacity.
