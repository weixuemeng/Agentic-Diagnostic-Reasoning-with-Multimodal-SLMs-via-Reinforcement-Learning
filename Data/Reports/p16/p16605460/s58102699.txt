                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever, cough, and body aches.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is an area of increased density
 within the right lower lung on the frontal projection.  No clear correlate is
 visualized on the lateral view, but given the clinical history, findings may
 represent a small pneumonia.  No other confluent consolidation is identified. 
 There is no vascular congestion, edema, or pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax
 is evident.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small focus of increased density in the right lower lung on
 frontal projection only which could reflect a small pneumonia given the
 clinical history.  No pleural effusion.
