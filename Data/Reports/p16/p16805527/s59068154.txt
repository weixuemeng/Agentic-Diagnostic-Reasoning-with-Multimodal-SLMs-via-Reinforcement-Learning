                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is substantial interval improvement of left mid lung and right lower
 lobe opacities, most likely consistent with interval resolution of aspiration

 fact that on ___, no abnormalities were present.  There is small
 amount of bilateral pleural effusion, unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
