                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with persistent asthma exacerbation,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study ___ ___.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The
 configuration indicates a left ventricular prominence to the left and
 posteriorly.  This finding in conjunction with the generally widened and
 elongated thoracic aorta is suggestive of systemic hypertension.  This cardiac
 enlargement is rather similar to what has been noticed on the previous chest
 examination ___ ___.  The pulmonary vasculature on the other hand has
 undergone a change in it, much as the vasculature is more plethoric and shows
 perivascular haze consistent with some mild degree of interstitial edema.  In
 addition, the lateral pleural sinuses are now blunted by small amounts of
 pleural effusion that extend into the posterior pleural sinuses as seen on the
 lateral view.  There is no evidence of new discrete pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrates and no pneumothorax can be identified in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent moderate degree of cardiomegaly, most likely related
 to systemic hypertension.  Since the preceding examination, the patient has
 developed an episode of interstitial edema and mild bilateral pleural
 effusions.  This finding indicates mild degree of chronic CHF, but there is no
 evidence of new acute pneumonic infiltrate.
