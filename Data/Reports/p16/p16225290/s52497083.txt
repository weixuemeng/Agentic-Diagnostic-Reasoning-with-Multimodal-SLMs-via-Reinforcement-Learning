                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette with some widening of the superior mediastinum. 
 Pulmonary vessels are slightly more indistinct, suggesting some elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Bibasilar opacification is consistent with pleural
 effusions and compressive atelectasis, though some of this may merely reflect
 overlying soft tissues.
