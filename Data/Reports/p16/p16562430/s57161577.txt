                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  IPF with possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 slightly better inspiration.  Diffuse interstitial prominence persists in this
 patient with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, most likely representing a
 combination of underlying pulmonary fibrosis and elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.  In the appropriate setting, the possibility of supervening
 pneumonia would be difficult to exclude given the substrate of diffuse
 pulmonary disease.
