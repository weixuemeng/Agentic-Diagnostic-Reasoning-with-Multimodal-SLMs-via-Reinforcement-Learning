                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of chest pain, fever,
 shortness of breath, hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 There is another comparison, a reference made to chest CT from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single, AP, upright, portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 There are increased interstitial marking.  Given history of pulmonary fibrosis
 on prior CT, although increased interstitial markings have significantly
 increased since the prior and there may be superimposed pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is slight blunting of
 both costophrenic angles, felt most likely be due to overlying soft tissues,
 but a trace pleural effusions be difficult to exclude.  No right pleural
 effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased markings bilaterally may be due to the combination of
 underlying pulmonary fibrosis and moderate pulmonary edema, superimposed
 infectious process cannot be excluded.
