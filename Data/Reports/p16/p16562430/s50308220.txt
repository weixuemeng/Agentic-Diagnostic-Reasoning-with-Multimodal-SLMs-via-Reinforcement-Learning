                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:42 A.M.  ON ___:
 
 HISTORY:  Severe pulmonary fibrosis presenting with acute worsening shortness
 of breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Comparing today's study with ___, the low lung volumes are unchanged
 but there is greater opacification throughout both lungs, most readily
 attributed to worsening pulmonary edema in the setting of pre-existing severe
 pulmonary fibrosis.  Given the severity of the acute and chronic pulmonary
 abnormalities, concurrent pneumonia would be difficult to exclude
 radiographically but there is no asymmetry to suggest it.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged, but generally obscured by adjacent parenchymal pulmonary
 abnormalities.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
