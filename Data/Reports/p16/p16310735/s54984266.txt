                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are somewhat hyperexpanded with
 interstitial abnormality with septal thickening and small bilateral pleural
 effusions, consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  The possibility of
 parenchymal opacities in the right middle and lower lobes is suggested due to
 obscuration of the medial right hemidiaphragm and right heart border.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged with sternotomy wires appearing intact. Patient is
 status post CABG. Curvilinear calcification along the anterior aspect of the
 heart on the lateral view is unchanged, and again likely reflects the site of
 prior infarction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions. Possible
 superimposed parenchymal opacities.  Consider re-evaluation after diuresis for
 better assessment.
