 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pre-existing opacity.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of moderate pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly.  A pre-existing zone of
 opacity along the right heart border is minimally decreased in extent and
 likely represents atelectasis.  No larger pleural effusions are visualized. 
 No evidence of pneumonia.
