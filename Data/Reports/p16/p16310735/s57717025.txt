  Mild interstitial edema.  Bibasilar consolidations, right greater than left,
  which could represent atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded.  If
  clinically possible and if clinically indicated, PA and lateral chest
  radiographs could be performed for further evaluation.  Discussed with Dr.
  ___ by Dr. ___ by telephone at 20:12 on ___ at the time of
  initial review.  Trace right pleural effusion.

 INDICATION:  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chemotherapy, shortness of breath,
 evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  Size of the cardiac silhouette remains slightly enlarged and small
 pleural effusions are seen bilaterally.  In addition, there is evidence of
 mild interstitial fluid overload as well as a new parenchymal opacity at the
 medial aspects of the right lung bases, potentially reflecting early
 pneumonia.  Overall, the findings would be consistent with a combination of
 fluid overload and early pneumonia.  It was delivered at the time of image
 acquisition.
