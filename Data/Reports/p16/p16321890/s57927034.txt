                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p bicycle vs motor vehicle p/w SAH/SDH/Contusions  
 Sag/coronal fx  // interval changes?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate interstitial edema is developed throughout both lungs. More
 pronounced opacification in the right mid an lung lower lung zones could
 represent either asymmetric edema or the development of concurrent pneumonia
 or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Borderline cardiomegaly has increased since
 ___. Interim endotracheal extubation, may have contributed to the
 current picture because the termination of positive pressure ventilation may
 encourage edema, and extubation may have permitted aspiration.
 
 Left subclavian line ends in the low SVC.  No pneumothorax. Pleural effusions
 are presumed, but not substantial.
