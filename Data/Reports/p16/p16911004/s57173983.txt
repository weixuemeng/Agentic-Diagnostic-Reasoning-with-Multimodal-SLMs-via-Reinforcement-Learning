                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with chest pain  // eval for pna, cardiomegaly
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated.  Moderate to large right and small to moderate left
 pleural effusions are noted.  There is right basilar opacity which is likely
 at least in part due to atelectasis given adjacent effusion.  There is
 additional opacity projecting over the right upper lung, on the lateral view
 localized posteriorly.  There is moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with associated
 atelectasis particularly at the right lung base noting that infection is
 difficult to exclude.
 Superimposed asymmetric right upper lung opacity, potentially pulmonary edema
 or infection.  Followup will be necessary after treatment.
