 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Swan-Ganz catheter has changed in position, with tip now
 terminating within the right ventricle as communicated by phone to Dr. ___ at
 1:27 a.m. on ___ by telephone at the time of discovery.  Other
 indwelling devices are in standard position, and overall appearance of the
 chest is similar to the prior study except for a slight improved aeration in
 the left retrocardiac region, and development of a triangular opacity in the
 right infrahilar area suggestive of localized atelectasis or focal aspiration.
