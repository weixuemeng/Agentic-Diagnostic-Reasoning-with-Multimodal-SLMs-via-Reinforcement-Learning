                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute liver failure and non-productive
 cough for 5 days  // Pneumonia? Cardiomegaly? Pulmonary edema?      Pneumonia?
 Cardiomegaly? Pulmonary edema?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette. The pulmonary vascularity appears more engorged
 than on the previous study, as does the size of the azygos vein. However, this
 could merely reflect a similar degree of vascular congestion in a patient who
 has now assumed a portable AP position.
