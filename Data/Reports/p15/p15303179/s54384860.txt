                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dry cough for weeks and smoking
 history, rule out infiltrate or nodule.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest again demonstrate marked
 peripheral reticular interstitial markings.  The right upper lobe apical
 scarring has particularly worsened since the prior study.  Heart and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  No effusion and no pneumothorax.  No new
 nodules are identified and no obvious evidence of acute pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Widespread parenchymal abnormalities, progressed since the prior
 study, particularly in the right upper lobe.  Would recommend a CT for
 evaluation of interstitial disease and for baseline for nodules as the
 underlying parenchymal disease makes it difficult to evaluate for this.
