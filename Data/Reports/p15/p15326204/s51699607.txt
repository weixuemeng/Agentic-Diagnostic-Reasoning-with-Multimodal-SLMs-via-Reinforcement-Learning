                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia, now with new concern for free
 intra-abdominal air.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___
 at 10:53.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Bilateral, multifocal areas of consolidation appear
 relatively unchanged.  Stable, small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 Previously seen free intra-abdominal air is not identified on the current
 study, but given that this is not a true upright radiograph, pneumoperitoneum
 cannot be excluded.  Recommend repeat upright PA and lateral radiographs or CT
 for definitive evaluation of intra-abdominal free air.
