 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left subclavian line tip is at the level of lower SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are stable.  Multifocal opacities have improved consistent with
 improvement of pulmonary edema.  Still persistent left infrahilar
 consolidation might reflect infection, attention to this area on the
 subsequent studies is recommended.  No pneumothorax.
