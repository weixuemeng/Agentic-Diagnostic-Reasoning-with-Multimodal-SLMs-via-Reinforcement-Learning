                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia status post NG tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___
 at 08:16.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval insertion of a nasogastric tube, which terminates in
 the stomach.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Slight
 interval worsening of bilateral, multifocal areas of consolidation.  Apparent
 interval increase in size of left pleural effusion may be positional.  Free
 intraperitoneal air is not well seen on the current study, likely secondary to
 changes in position.  Stable, mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.
 2.  Slight interval worsening of bilateral, multifocal areas of consolidation.
