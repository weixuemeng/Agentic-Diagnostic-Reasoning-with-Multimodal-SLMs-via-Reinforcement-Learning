                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fevers, has L sided dialysis line  // ? pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study is dated ___ and a prior CTA chest is
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   A left IJ access dialysis
 catheter is again noted with its tip in the low SVC or possibly at the
 cavoatrial junction.  A stent is again noted within the left brachiocephalic
 vein.  Lung volumes are markedly low with bibasilar atelectasis and
 bronchovascular crowding.  Difficult to exclude a subtle underlying pneumonia.
 No convincing signs of edema.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Overall
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unchanged. Imaged osseous
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis, difficult to exclude a subtle underlying pneumonia. 
 Dialysis catheter in place.
