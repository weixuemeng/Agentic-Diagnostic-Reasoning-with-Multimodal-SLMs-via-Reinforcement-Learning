                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF and tachypnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with opacification at the left base
 consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe. 
 There is pleural fluid on the right as well tracking along the right lateral
 chest wall into the minor fissure.  Otherwise, little change.
