                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath
 and chest pain, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Left
 costophrenic angle is underpenetrated, likely due to overlying soft tissue. 
 Lung volumes are relatively low.  No focal consolidation, large pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  Minimal pulmonary vascular congestion may be present,
 although may relate to technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia, possible very
 minimal vascular congestion.
