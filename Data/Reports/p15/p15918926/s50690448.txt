                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with recent tracheoplasty operation, now
 with pleuritic chest pain after tracheoplasty.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Mediastinal structures, heart and significant
 pericardial fat pad of unchanged appearance.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  Central airways including trachea and main bronchi on frontal view
 appear free.  There exists a few peripheral linear plate atelectasis on the
 left base, rather unchanged.  Crowded appearance of pulmonary vasculature in
 retrocardiac left-sided area suggestive of partial atelectasis and unchanged. 
 On the right side, there exists a small plate atelectasis in the mid lung,
 apparently regressing from previous findings.  Noteworthy is, however, that
 the amount of pleural blunting of the lateral sinus has increased indicating
 mild increase of the right-sided pleural effusion.  Amount of pleural density
 in the right-sided posterior pleural sinus, however, is small.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area and the previously identifiable
 remaining local soft tissue emphysema has now disappeared.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Grossly stable chest findings, no new pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrates but with amount of small right-sided pleural effusion.
