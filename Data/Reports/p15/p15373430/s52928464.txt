                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of end-stage
 renal disease on peritoneal dialysis with fever of unknown origin and
 worsening shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to prior
 study from ___ obtained at 08:35 a.m.
 
 There is interval progression of bilateral interstitial opacities, highly
 concerning for progression of pulmonary edema.  In addition, there is more
 pronounced right lower lobe consolidation that, although might be part of
 pulmonary edema, can also represent an unrelated infectious process.  The
 assessment of the patient after diuresis is recommended.  Small amount of
 pleural effusion is most likely present.
