                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right chest pain after tunneled pleural catheter placement. 
 Evaluate pneumothorax placement tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph.
 
 Even allowing for this, the heart size is a little increased.  Heavy
 tracheobronchial calcification is likely senescent in nature.  There are
 bilateral pleural effusions, in addition there is significantly increased lung
 markings, particularly over the left upper lung zone.  There is a small right
 apical pneumothorax.  Cannot definitively identify a pleural drain.  Osseous
 structures show degenerative change in the shoulders, otherwise unremarkable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 Small right apical pneumothorax.  The catheter is not definitively identified.
