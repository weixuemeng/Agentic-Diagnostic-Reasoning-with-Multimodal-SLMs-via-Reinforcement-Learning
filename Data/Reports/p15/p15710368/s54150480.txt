                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette appears relatively unchanged compared to prior study.  Worsening
 opacification within the right lung base is concerning for an infectious
 process.  There is a small to moderate sized right pleural effusion. The
 aortic knob remains calcified.  There are persistent ill-defined nodular
 opacities demonstrated within the upper lobes, slightly progressed when
 compared to the prior study, which could represent an inflammatory or
 infectious process.  Deformity of the left humeral head is suggestive of old
 trauma, with degenerative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening opacification within the right lung base concerning for
 infection with a small to moderate sized right pleural effusion.
 2.  Persistent ill-defined nodular opacities with an upper lobe predominance,
 which may be slightly progressed when compared to the prior study.  As before,
 this can be further evaluated with a dedicated chest CT, as it may represent
 an infectious or inflammatory process.
