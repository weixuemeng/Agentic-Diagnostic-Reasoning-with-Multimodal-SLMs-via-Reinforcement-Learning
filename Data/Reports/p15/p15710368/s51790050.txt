                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient after transbronchial biopsy.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Widespread parenchymal consolidations
 are unchanged in extent and distribution.  The right hilar mass is
 redemonstrated.  Slight worsening of the right lower lobe atelectasis is noted
 on the current radiograph that might reflect interval increase in pleural
 effusion or additional compression of the right lower lobe airways.
