                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM: Patient with metastatic lung cancer, right pleural effusion
 and increasing shortness of breath.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion has markedly increased.  Left pleural effusion
 is small, minimally increased from prior.
 
 Cardiomegaly is unchanged, partially obscured by pleural and parenchymal
 abnormalities.  Pleural effusion on the right is associated with  right lower
 lobe and right middle lobe atelectasis.  Diffuse lung opacities consistent
 with widespread cavitary lesions greater in the left upper lobe are unchanged.
 Minimally increased opacity in the right upper lobe is likely an area of new
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Kyphosis and degenerative changes are
 again noted.
