                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer and Pleurx
 catheter for effusion.  No drainage.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is larger.  I cannot see a Pleurx catheter
 because they are barely radiopaque.  There is no right pneumothorax.  Right
 upper lung is clear.  Lower lung is partially atelectatic and partially
 obscured by fissural component of pleural effusion.  Left lung is well
 expanded and clear.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is no left
 pleural abnormality.  Severe degeneration of left shoulder is chronic.
