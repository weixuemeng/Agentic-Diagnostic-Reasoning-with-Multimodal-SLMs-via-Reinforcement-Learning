                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer with pulmonary collapse and effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is further
 opacification of the lower half of the right hemithorax.  This is consistent
 with worsening volume loss in the right lower lobe and pleural effusion.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia could certainly not be
 excluded.
 
 There is evidence of some increased pulmonary venous pressure, but no definite
 consolidation in the left lung.
