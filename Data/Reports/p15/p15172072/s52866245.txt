                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with leg swelling and sob  // chf
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Given technical differences, moderate
 cardiac enlargement, hilar contours, and lungs are likely unchanged from prior
 examination, although mild vascular congestion cannot be excluded given slight
 diffuse increase in lung opacification.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable without focal consolidation.  Left shoulder arthroplasty
 appears unchanged.  Chronic left lung scarring is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
