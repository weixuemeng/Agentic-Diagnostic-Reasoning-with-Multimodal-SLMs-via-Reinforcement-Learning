                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and COPD with
 disappearing bile duct syndrome.  Presenting with hypokalemia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation.  Hazy opacification
 of the left base is likely atelectasis.  There is no focal airspace opacity,
 small pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal
 contours are somewhat wide, though likely post-surgical after a prior CABG. 
 The heart size is normal.  Sternal wires are intact.  Mediastinal clips are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process in this limited exam.
