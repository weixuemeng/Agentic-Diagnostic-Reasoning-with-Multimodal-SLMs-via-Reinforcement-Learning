                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral series were compared with prior radiographs through
 ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral lungs are well expanded.  Multiple, small, lung nodules
 and small hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes seen on prior chest CT's are
 beyond resolution of radiograph and not demonstrated. There is no pleural
 effusion. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No relevant change since prior radiograph dated ___. 
 Multiple small lung nodules and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy
 demonstrated on the prior chest CTs are not visualized.  CT is more sensitive
 in detecting the lung nodules, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and interval
 changes.
