                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:52 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with GI bleed, blood transfusion, new oxygen
 requirement and dyspnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower, upper lobe pulmonary vessels larger and mild
 interstitial edema worsened since ___.  The particular coalescence of
 opacity around larger left hilus could be asymmetric distribution of edema,
 but should be reevaluated to assess the possibility of concurrent pneumonia. 
 Pleural effusions are small.  Elevation of the diaphragm reflects chronic
 ascites.
 
 Mediastinal contours, right paratracheal thickening, obliteration of the
 aortopulmonic window, and enlargement of the left hilus all suggest that
 central adenopathy may have increased over the past several days since the
 torso CT on ___.  This could explain apparent narrowing of the entire
 left main bronchus.  Careful followup is advised.
