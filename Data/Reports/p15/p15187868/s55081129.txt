                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___'s disease, presenting with choking, episodes of
 hypotension, question acute process, aspiration.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes. Hyphotic positioning.  Allowing for this,
 mild prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. 
 Upper zone redistribution is likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. 
 Minimal atelectasis at left greater than right bases, is not appreciably
 changed. The possibility that opacities, particularly at the left base could
 reflect aspiration would be difficult to exclude.  No pneumothorax detected. 
 No gross effusion. Again seen is large calcified granuloma in the right upper
 zone.
 
 Advanced degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are incidentally
 noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Doubt but cannot entirely exclude changes
 due to aspiration at the left lung base.
