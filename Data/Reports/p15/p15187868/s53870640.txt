                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain status post compressions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Rounded density measuring 15 mm within the
 right upper lobe likely reflects a calcified granuloma. Streaky opacities in
 the lung bases are compatible with areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is identified. No displaced fractures are seen. Multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine. Anterior wedge
 compression deformity at the thoracolumbar junction is of indeterminate age. 
 Degenerative changes are also noted involving the right glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  15 mm calcified rounded lesion in the right upper lobe
 compatible with a granuloma. No displaced rib fractures. Age indeterminate
 compression deformity of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction.
