 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 6:23 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube is now
 better visible.  The tip projects over the very proximal parts of the stomach
 and the tube is coiled in the stomach.  The course of the tube is otherwise
 unremarkable.  There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
 The appearance of the lung parenchyma, the cardiac silhouette and the
 mediastinal structures is unchanged.
