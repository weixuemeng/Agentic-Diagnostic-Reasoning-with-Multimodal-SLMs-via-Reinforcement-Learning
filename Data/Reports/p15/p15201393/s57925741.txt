 HISTORY:  Seizure disorder and seizure with fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs
 are well expanded and clear with the exception of retrocardiac faint opacity
 which is most likely atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. subtle gas lucency projecting over the heart at the midline
 could represent air in the distal esophagus or a subtle hiatal hernia. The
 heart is normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  No displaced
 rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.
