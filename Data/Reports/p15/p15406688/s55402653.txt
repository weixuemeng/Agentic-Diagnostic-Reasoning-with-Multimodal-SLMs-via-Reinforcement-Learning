                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shock and respiratory failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable.  There is
 continued improvement of central vascular engorgement and right effusion.  The
 left base consolidation with small to moderate effusion is slightly worse and
 is likely atelectasis, although infection cannot be excluded given the
 appropriate clinical setting.  A left pacer and right internal jugular
 catheter are unchanged in position.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Improved vascular congestion and right effusion.  Left base consolidation is
 slightly worse and is likely atelectatic, although infection cannot be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical circumstance.
