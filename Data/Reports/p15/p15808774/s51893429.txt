                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with pneumothorax with Heimlich tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent prior is ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable upright view of the chest was obtained.  The
 lung bases are underpenetrated.  A dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is seen with
 leads extending to the expected position of the right atrium and likely the
 right ventricle, although the very inferior aspect of the right ventricular
 lead is not fully included in the image.  There are multiple overlying lead
 wires.  A tubular structure/catheter is seen extending into the left lung apex
 which takes a sharp curve projecting over the lung apex.  A possible residual
 small left apical pneumothorax is seen; however, consider followup with
 removal of external artifact.  There are bibasilar opacities, left greater
 than right, which could be due to underlying infection/pneumonia and/or
 aspiration.  Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle raises concern for
 small left pleural effusion.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The
 cardiac silhouette is not well assessed through the bibasilar opacities, most
 likely top normal.  There are degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular
 joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, raises concern for
 an infection/pneumonia and/or aspiration.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle may be due to a small pleural effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 A tubular structure/catheter extending into the left lung apex with possible
 tiny left apical pneumothorax remaining.  However, suggest followup with
 removal of external artifact for better evaluation.  Upright PA and lateral
 views may be helpful for further evaluation when/if patient able.
