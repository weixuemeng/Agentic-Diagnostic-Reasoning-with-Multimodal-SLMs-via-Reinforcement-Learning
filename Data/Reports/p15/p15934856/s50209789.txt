                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Multifocal pneumonia after VATS and removal of the
 chest tube.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates removal of the right chest tube with
 no definitive pneumothorax developed in the interim.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged, but there is slight interval increase in bilateral
 perihilar and lower lobe opacities, potentially representing fluctuation in 
 pulmonary edema, but underlying process such as ARDS worsening is another
 possibility.
