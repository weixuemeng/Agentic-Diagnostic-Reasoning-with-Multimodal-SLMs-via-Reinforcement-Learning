                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with tachycardia and back pain.  Evaluate for
 acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.
 
 Right chest wall port is seen with catheter tip in the upper SVC.  Extremely
 low lung volumes are seen.  Streaky opacities at the lung bases are suggestive
 of atelectasis.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angle may represent
 small effusion versus atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly
 unchanged.  Severe compression deformity in mid thoracic spine is not
 significantly changed from prior.  Osseous structures are otherwise grossly
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.  Possible small
 effusion versus atelectasis.  Compression deformity in mid thoracic spine as
 previously seen.
