                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Spiking fevers in a patient with potential biliary
 abscess.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right PICC line tip is in the right atrium and should be pulled back
 approximately 2 cm to secure its position in the cavoatrial junction or above.
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Upper lungs are clear.  Bibasal
 atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions are redemonstrated,
 unchanged since the prior study.
