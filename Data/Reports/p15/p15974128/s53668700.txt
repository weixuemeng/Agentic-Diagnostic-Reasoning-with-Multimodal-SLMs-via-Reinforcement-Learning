                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with CAD, dCHF, presenting to ___ with hypoxia.  //
 ?pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are now low in both lungs; left hemidiaphragm is chronically
 elevated. Moderate cardiomegaly is exaggerated by low lung volumes also
 crowding of pulmonary vasculature and simulates mild edema. Mediastinal
 caliber, particularly in the right lower paratracheal station is increasing. 
 Some of the retrocardiac airspace opacity, seen best on the lateral
 projection, is atelectasis, but least one lung mass seen on recent abdomen and
 Chest CT scans, which also showed extensive central adenopathy developing over
 the past year. There may be new left upper lung nodules as well. Small pleural
 effusions are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Borderline interstitial edema.
 
 Increasing central adenopathy and possible lung masses. CT scanning
 recommended for evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to ___ QA nurses by receipted
