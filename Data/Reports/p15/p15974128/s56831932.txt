                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The exam is somewhat limited by technique and body habitus.  Within

 most recent radiograph.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  There is no focal
 airspace opacity, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours
 are normal.  The heart size is moderately enlarged, and unchanged.  A
 compression deformity in a lower thoracic or upper lumbar vertebral body is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly with unchanged mild vascular congestion.
