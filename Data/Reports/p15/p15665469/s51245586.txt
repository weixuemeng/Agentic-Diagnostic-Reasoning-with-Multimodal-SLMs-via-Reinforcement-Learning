 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.   There are bilateral upper lung regions of
 consolidation, right worse than left.  There is also opacity the right lung
 base obscuring the costophrenic angle potentially due to layering effusion. 
 The cardiac silhouette appears slightly enlarged but likely accentuated by low
 inspiratory effort and portable technique.  Atherosclerotic calcifications
 noted at the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.  Left chest wall dual
 lead pacing device seen.  The bones appear diffusely osteopenic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral upper lung regions of consolidation, right-greater-than-left
 compatible with infection in the proper clinical setting.  Probable right
 pleural effusion.  Recommend repeat after treatment to document resolution.
