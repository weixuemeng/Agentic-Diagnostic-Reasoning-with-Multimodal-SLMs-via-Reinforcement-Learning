                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest.  There are new bilateral patchy opacities,
 mainly central and in the lower lobes.  There is a more confluent opacity in
 the left mid lung.  There are new moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right
 greater than left.  No pneumothorax.  The heart is not well evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION: New bilateral patchy opacities and moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions, with more confluent opacity in left mid lung.  While there is most
 likely underlying at least moderate pulmonary edema, the more confluent
 opacity in the left mid lung most likely represents hemmorhage, cannot
 entirely rule out infection.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 6:40am on
 ___ by phone at time of discovery.
