                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ANCA vasculitis and likely alveolar hemorrhage, please assess
 position of enteric tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is interval placement of enteric tube with tip residing in
 the stomach.  The ET tube remains in standard position.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There has been perhaps slight interval improvement in the bilateral
 parenchymal opacities, particularly in the upper lung zones.  However,
 extensive parenchymal opacities still remain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory positioning of enteric tube with tip in the stomach.
 Slight improvement in bilateral parenchymal opacities.
