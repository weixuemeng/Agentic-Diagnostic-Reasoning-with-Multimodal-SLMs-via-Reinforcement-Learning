                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ANCA vasculitis with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, assess
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There has
 been interval slight decrease in the now small right pleural effusion, and the
 left pleural effusion has remained stable.  The bilateral perihilar pulmonary
 consolidations are improved, but not resolved on the current study.
 Atelectatic changes at both lung bases are also present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement in the right pleural effusion and perihilar
 opacities, which may be in keeping with pulmonary edema given the history of
 diuresis.  However, hemorrhage and infection are still potential etiologies.
