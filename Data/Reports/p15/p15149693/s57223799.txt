                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fall and hip fracture.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  As on prior exams, there
 is diffuse increased reticular markings and known bronchiectasis.  There is no
 definite superimposed acute process; however, subtle interval change would be
 difficult to exclude given the extent of the parenchymal disease.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 identified.  Posterior right sixth rib deformity is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse bilateral abnormality in the lungs, previously
 characterized by CT.  No definite acute superimposed process, although subtle
 change could easily be obscured.
