                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic cough and bronchiectasis, for evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Generalized increased lung markings are identified throughout the lungs, with
 significant bronchial wall opacification and dilatation.  Areas of right mid
 zone scarring, unchanged from ___.  There is now much more
 pronounced from that radiograph left mid zone changes most consistent with
 consolidation.
 
 In the right lower lobe, there are some mildly increased lung markings again
 which may represent some infection.
 
 The osseous structures reveal some bony osteopenia and minor dorsal kyphosis.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Patchy changes in the left mid zone, certainly could represent consolidation.
 
 Extensive background changes most consistent with provided history of
 bronchiectasis.  A followup radiograph in six weeks is suggested for further
 evaluation.D/W Dr ___
