                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post cardiac arrest, sent from outside hospital, now
 intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately
 3 cm from the carina.  An orogastric tube tip terminates just beyond the
 gastroesophageal junction, and should be advanced for optimal positioning. 
 The heart size is top normal.  Diffuse ill-defined alveolar opacities are
 noted, most predominantly in the perihilar regions, left lung more involved
 than the right.  There is blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally,
 which may reflect small effusions.  No pneumothorax identified. A large bulla
 appears to be present in the right lower lobe, and severe emphysematous
 changes are noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube in standard position.  The orogastric tube tip
 terminates just beyond the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced
 further for optimal positioning.
 2.  Diffuse airspace opacities in both lungs, primarily in the perihilar
 regions.  Findings suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema, though, multifocal
 infection is not excluded.  Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3. Severe emphysema.
