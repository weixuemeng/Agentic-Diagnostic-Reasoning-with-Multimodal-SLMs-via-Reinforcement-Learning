                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and back pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest.  The lungs are well-expanded
 and clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is mild to moderatly enlarged, consistent with
 cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.  No plumonary edema or pleural
 effusion is seen to suggest heart failure.  The mediastinal veins are not
 dilated, indicating that if there is a pleural effusion it is not
 hemodynamically significant.  The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is mild to moderatly enlarged.  In this
 patient, this could represent cardiomegaly without heart failure or a
 non-hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion.
