                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with sarcoidosis, here for follow-up.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Asymmetric opacity in the right apex and lateral upper lung corresponds to
 non-specific ground glass opacities on CT in ___, representing sequelae of
 prior infection.  No focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax.  Left lung volume loss with juxtaphrenic peak is unchanged
 since at least ___.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinum is not
 widened.  No hilar lymphadenopathy.  Apical pleural thickening is minimal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No radiographic evidence of sarcoidosis.
 2.  Right upper lung and apex asymmetric opacities are chronic and may
 represent sequelae of prior infection, better appreciated on CT.
