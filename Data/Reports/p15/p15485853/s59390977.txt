                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea  // Eval for worsening PNA/pulmonary
 edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 There has been interval removal of endotracheal and enteric tubes. A
 right-sided porta cath is again seen, terminating in the low SVC/ cavoatrial
 junction. There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette. There appears to be persistent loss of volume of the right lung
 with linear opacities seen scattered throughout which may be due to
 atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema is seen on the left. There is mild
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. While there is subtle left basilar
 retrocardiac opacity, this region appears better aerated/improved compared to
 the prior study.
 Chronic appearing deformity of the right midclavicle.
