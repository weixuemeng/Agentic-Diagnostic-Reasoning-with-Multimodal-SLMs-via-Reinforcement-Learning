 There is poor lung expansion. Continued bilateral basilar atelectatic changes
 consistent with prior exam.  ET tube is now noted with distal tip
 approximately 1.8 cm above the carinal. It is recommended to withdraw ET tube
 approximately 1.5 cm.  There is a question of over-inflation of the ET tube
 balloon/cuff, it is unclear if this is necessary given patient's known
 tracheobronchial malacia. Otherwise there are no significant interval changes
 noted.
