                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ARDS  // Any interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 ET tube tip approximately 4.4 cm above the carina, at the level of the mid
 clavicular heads . NG tube not well seen through the lower mediastinum, though
 it appears to extend beneath the diaphragm, off the film. Right IJ central
 line is unchanged, with tip at cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Again seen are extensive nodular and confluent opacities in both lungs, most
 pronounced along the periphery of the right lung.  Right and left costophrenic
 angles are both obscured, suggesting bilateral pleural effusions. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared with 1 day earlier, I doubt significant interval change. Extensive
 bilateral opacities consistent with ARDS again seen.
