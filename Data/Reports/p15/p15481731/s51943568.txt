 Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates endotracheal tube at the
 level of the clavicles 6.5 cm above the level of the carina. A nasogastric
 tube is seen coursing mid line with tip out of field of view and side ports
 below the level of the diaphragm.
 
 Diffuse patchy opacities are seen throughout the right lung and left upper
 lung with slightly more confluent area within the right lower lobe. No
 pneumothorax.  No left pleural effusion. Right costophrenic angle is not
 visualized however no large right pleural effusion.
