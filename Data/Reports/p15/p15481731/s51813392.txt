 There is a nasogastric tube extending below the diaphragm.  There is a right
 IJ central catheter with tip in the lower superior vena cava.
 
 There are unchanged peripheral bilateral airspace opacities with areas of with
 worsening or right midlung and right lower lung opacification. Right
 costophrenic angle blunting is mildly increased. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits. Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Persistent multifocal bilateral airspace opacities consistent with
 multifocal pneumonia.  Slight worsening in left mid and lower lung.
