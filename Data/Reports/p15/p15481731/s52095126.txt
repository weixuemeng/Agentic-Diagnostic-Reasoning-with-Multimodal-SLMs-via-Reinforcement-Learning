                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumomediastinum and small apical
 pneumothorax seen on chest CT // Evidence of worsening pneumomediastinum or
 pneumothorax? Evidence of worsening pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral upright chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left PICC terminates in the low superior vena cava.
 
 The distal neo esophagus contains residual oral contrast along its posterior
 wall. The anterior tracheal wall has a trace amount of barium.  There is no
 pleural effusion.
 
 Bilateral diffuse opacities and prominent interstitial markings of the mid to
 upper lungs are unchanged.  Retrosternal lucency on lateral projection
 corresponds to area question pneumomediastinum on prior CT.  Comparison is
 difficult due to differences in technique, however the volume of air is
 grossly unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Findings of the retrosternal air on lateral projection is unchanged
 compared to CT ___, accounting for differences in technique.
 2. Unchanged bilateral mid to upper lung opacities and prominent interstitial
 markings.
