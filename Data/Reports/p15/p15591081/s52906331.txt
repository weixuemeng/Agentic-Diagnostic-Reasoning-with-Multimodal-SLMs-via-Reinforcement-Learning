                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube placement from outside hospital.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  the endotracheal tube ends 6.3 cm above the carina.  An enteric
 tube extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film, but the side port is
 probably above the GE junction -- clinical consideration regarding advancing
 the tube is therefore reuqested.  
 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cephalization of the upper lobe lung markings bilaterally either represents
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion or scarring. Old healed right-sided rib
 fractures noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion versus apical scarring. No overt CHF.
 
 2. Endotracheal tube ends 6.3 cm from the carina.
 
 3. Enteric tube ends off the inferior portion of the image; however, the last
 side port appears at or above the GE junction.  Recommend advancing.  
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 7:58am on
