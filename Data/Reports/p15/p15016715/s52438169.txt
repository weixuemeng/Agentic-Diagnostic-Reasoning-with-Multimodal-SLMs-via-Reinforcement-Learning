                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, cough and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable allowing for
 differences in technique. New multifocal opacities are noted in the right
 lower and left mid lungs, the latter in the perihilar region. Vague right
 upper lung opacity is more equivocal. Opacity is most confluent in the left
 lower lobe. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with pneumonia, probably multifocal but most extensive in
 the left lower lobe.
