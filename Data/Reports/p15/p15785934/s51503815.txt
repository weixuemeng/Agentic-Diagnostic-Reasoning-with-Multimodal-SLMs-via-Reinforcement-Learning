                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with fall, delirium, rales at bases,
 evaluate for acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semiupright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding chest examination which was dated ___.  The
 indication for the almost ___-year-old preceding examination was similar in as
 much the patient had experienced a fall and acute injuries were questioned at
 the emergency room examination.  The present portable chest examination shows
 similar findings in as much as the heart size is borderline and the thoracic
 aorta is moderately elongated and widened with calcium deposits in the wall. 
 There is, however, no suspicious local contour abnormality.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  In comparison with the next previous
 examination, however, the left base is somewhat poorly ventilated with crowded
 vasculature and mildly elevated left-sided diaphragm.  The left lateral
 pleural sinus; however, is free and thus there is no evidence of pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The general appearance of some irregular
 vascular peripheral distribution is suggestive of COPD.  No pneumothorax in
 the apical area.  Unchanged appearance of a left-sided shoulder arthrodesis
 with metallic humeral head prosthesis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possibly beginning infiltrate on the left lung base.  Otherwise,
 no acute infiltrates or marked CHF on this portable chest examination. 
 Followup study is recommended.  Page to Dr. ___ was placed at 3:40 p.m.
