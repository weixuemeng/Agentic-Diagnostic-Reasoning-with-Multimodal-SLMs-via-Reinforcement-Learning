                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubation  // ett placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Supine portable chest radiograph demonstrate low lung volumes.  An
 endotracheal tube is present and terminates approximately 3.6 cm above the
 level of the carina in appropriate position.  An enteric tube descends the
 thorax in uncomplicated course, its tip projecting below the left
 hemidiaphragm.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bibasilar
 patchy opacities likely reflects atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube and enteric tube.
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.  Aspiration and
 pneumonia are additional considerations in the appropriate clinical settings.
