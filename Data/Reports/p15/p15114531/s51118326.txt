                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent fever, cough, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are probably slightly hyperinflated. Prominence of the trachea is
 consistent with known tracheomalacia.  The heart is at the upper limits of
 normal or slightly enlarged.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is
 identified.  Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base is new compared with
 ___. C-spine fixation hardware seen at the edge of these films is new
 compared with ___.   Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  
 Upper abdominal surgical clips noted.
