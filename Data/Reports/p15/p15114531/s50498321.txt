                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:34 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Acute onset of stridor, assess airway.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Unfortunately the region of the larynx where one would look for a cause of
 stridor, is not included on this study.  There is a suggestion of narrowing of
 the airway, but that can be a normal finding in an elderly patient.  Lungs are
 clear.  Heart size is normal.  There is mild widening of the mediastinum which
 could be due to venous engorgement, and a vertically oriented air collection
 projecting to the left of the trachea along the aortic arch could be a swallow
 in the esophagus, however given concern about esophageal perforation, CT
 scanning is indicated to exclude air and fluid in the mediastinum.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed this case by telephone at the time of dictation.
