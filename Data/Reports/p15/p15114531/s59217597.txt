                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after intubation.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed.
 
 The ET tube tip has been inserted with its tip being 6 cm above the carina. 
 Dilatation of the trachea after intubation might reflect overinflation of the
 endotracheal tube cuff.  Left retrocardiac consolidation is new, most likely
 reflecting atelectasis/aspiration .  There is no appreciable pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax seen.
