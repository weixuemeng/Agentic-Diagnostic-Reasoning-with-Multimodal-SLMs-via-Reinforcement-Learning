                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and increased sputum production following stent
 removal.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  There is interval placement of
 Bravo pH capsule projecting over the expected location in the distal
 esophagus.  Surgical clips in the left upper abdomen are unchanged.  
 
 Lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Overall,
 there is minimal interval change including left lower lobe linear opacity that
 might represent atelectasis, although small infectious process in this area
 cannot be excluded.
 
 Note is also made of a large trachea, approaching 2.5 cm in coronal and 2 cm
 in the sagittal diameter in this patient with known tracheomalacia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New left lower lobe linear opacity that might reflect developing/resolving
 infectious involving infectious process versus atelectasis.
 
 Tracheomegaly.
