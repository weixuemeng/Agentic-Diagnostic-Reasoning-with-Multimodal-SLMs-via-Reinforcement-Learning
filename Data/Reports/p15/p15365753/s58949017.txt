 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  Increased interstitial markings and
 engorged pulmonary vasculature is consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
 There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
