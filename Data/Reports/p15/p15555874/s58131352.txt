                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with chest pain.  History of CAD.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___ and ___.  Left chest wall dual-lead pacing device
 again seen with leads in unchanged position from prior.  There is a new
 somewhat linear patchy region of opacity in the left lower lobe, not clearly
 seen on the previous exams.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  There is no
 effusion or pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but stable.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New region of consolidation in the left lower lobe, potentially
 atelectasis given its somewhat linear configuration; however, infection is not
 excluded, clinical correlation suggested.  Repeat exam is also suggested in
 the absence of signs of infection to ensure resolution.
