                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left internal jugular vascular catheter has been removed since the
 prior study.  Postoperative alterations are again demonstrated, consistent
 with prior left upper lobe resection and right upper lobe wedge resection
 procedures.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is longstanding and
 attributed to postoperative pleural thickening.  Left costophrenic sulcus
 blunting is more likely due to pleural fluid given the recency of the left
 upper lobectomy one month prior.  Stable postoperative appearance of
 cardiomediastinal contours.  No acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Status post left upper lobe resection with persistent small postoperative left
 pleural effusion.
