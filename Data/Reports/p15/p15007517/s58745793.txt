                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pulmonary edema in patient with end-stage liver
 disease status post multiple blood transfusions.
 
 COMPARISONS:  A series of portable chest radiograph, most recently from ___ and dating back to ___.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE AP RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  There is severe bilateral
 alveolar pulmonary edema, which is worse than on the most prior study from
 approximately 24 hours ago.  As a result, new central air bronchograms are
 apparent.  A right-sided central catheter is in unchanged position,
 terminating approximately at the cavoatrial junction.  Surgical clips are
 noted in the right upper quadrant.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are difficult to evaluate due to overlying edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Severe, worsening alveolar pulmonary edema.  Underlying infectious process
 cannot be ruled out.
