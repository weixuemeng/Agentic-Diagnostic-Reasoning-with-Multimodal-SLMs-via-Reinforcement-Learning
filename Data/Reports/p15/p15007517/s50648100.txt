                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with end-stage liver and renal disease with
 ARDS, assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright radiograph is obtained.  Endotracheal tube
 terminates 4.7 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach
 and appears to be curled within the fundus.  Multiple right upper quadrant
 clips are seen.  Bilateral central venous catheters are unchanged in
 satisfactory position.  
 
 Diffuse bilateral opacities are slightly improved without definite effusions. 
 Mild cardiomegaly persists along with mediastinal vascular engorgement. No
 pneumothorax is seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Slight improvement in moderate to severe pulmonary edema which by
 radiographic appearance may be explained by left ventricular dysfunction. No
 imaging findings to support or exclude TRALI or ARDS.
