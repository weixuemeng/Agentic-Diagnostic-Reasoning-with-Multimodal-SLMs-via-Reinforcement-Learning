                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female requiring fluids with rales.  Question
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate a right port
 catheter with tip in the upper SVC.  The lung volumes are low, accentuating
 the cardiac silhouette.  Extensive bilateral nodular opacities are more
 extensive compared to ___, even allowing for low lung volumes. 
 This appearance is consistent with known miliary pattern rectal cancer
 metastases, supervening infection or edema cannot be excluded but felt less
 likely.  Several large lung masses are better appreciated on preceding CT
 dated ___.  There is no pneumothorax or large effusion. 
 Atelectasis is seen in the right cardiophrenic angle.
 
 There is permeative destructive process involving the distal right clavicle,
 compatible with metastasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progressing diffuse pulmonary metastasis.  Supervening edema
 unlikely.
