                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Metastatic renal cancer and worsening cough.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Extensive miliary pattern consistent with widespread metastatic disease is
 redemonstrated.  No change in larger masses, for example, at the mid left lung
 and right lower lung are noted.  The left lower lobe mass is unchanged.  No
 new consolidations to suggest interval development of infectious process are
 noted within the limitations of this study technique.  Port-A-Cath catheter
 tip is at the level of mid SVC.
