                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of metastatic disease, now with
 hypoglycemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to most recent prior exam, there has been no significant
 interval change.  Diffusely distributed pulmonary nodules are again seen,
 better evaluated on CT dated ___.  Small changes in size and number
 cannot be evaluated with radiography.  The study is limited by profound volume
 loss, particularly when compared to ___.  Small pneumonia or even
 superimposed edema cannot be excluded in this setting.  There is persistent
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with right lower lung atelectasis, which
 is slightly improved compared to prior.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  A
 right-sided Port-A-Cath is in similar position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly improved right lower lung atelectasis with otherwise
 stable chest radiographs.  Superimposed mild edema and/or a small
 consolidation and may be obscured by metastatic disease and volume loss.
