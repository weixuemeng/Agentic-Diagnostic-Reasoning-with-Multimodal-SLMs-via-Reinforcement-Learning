                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF with desaturation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes.  There is some increased hazy opacification at the right base,
 consistent with pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis at the bases. 
 Extension of fluid is seen into the minor fissure.  Effusion with atelectasis
 is also seen at the left base with a thick band of atelectasis in the mid
 zone.
