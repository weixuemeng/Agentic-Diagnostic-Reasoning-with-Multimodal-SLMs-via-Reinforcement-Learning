                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Constipation, for NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a
 nasogastric tube that extends to the mid-to-lower body of the stomach.  There
 appears to be more asymmetry of the prominence of interstitial markings,
 raising the possibility of some degree of dependent gravitational edema. 
 Bilateral effusions persist.
