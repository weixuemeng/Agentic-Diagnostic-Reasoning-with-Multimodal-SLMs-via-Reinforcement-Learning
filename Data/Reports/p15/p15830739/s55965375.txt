                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single supine portable view of the chest.  Extremely low lung volumes are
 seen.  Exam is also limited secondary to positioning.  There are bibasilar
 opacities more conspicuous on the left.  Left hemidiaphragm is not delineated.
 Superiorly the lungs are clear of confluent consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette difficult to assess given positioning.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted in the thoracic aorta.  Severe degenerative changes
 seen at the shoulders bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited portable chest x-ray.  Bibasilar left greater than right opacities
 potentially atelectasis versus consolidation or potentially effusions.
