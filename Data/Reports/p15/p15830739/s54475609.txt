                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 6:23
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure, assess for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 4:14.
 
 A portable semi-supine chest film ___ at 6:24 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube now has its tip approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. 
 Left internal jugular central line is unchanged in position.  There is
 elevation of the left diaphragm with distended air-filled bowel.  There are
 linear opacities at the left base likely reflecting areas of atelectasis. 
 Patchy opacity at the right base also likely reflects atelectasis.  In
 addition, lung volumes are lower and there is fullness of the perihilar
 vasculature and prominence of the interstitium which suggests superimposed
 interstitial edema.  No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to
 detect a pneumothorax is reduced given semi-supine technique.  The aorta
 remains unfolded, prominent and tortuous.
