                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough, shortness of breath while lying down. 
 Some fluid buildup in the ankles.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Frontal exam is limited due to poor inspiratory
 effort, which likely accounts for the bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar
 opacities from secondary atelectasis.  On the lateral view, the lungs are
 relatively clear.  There is no effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged as are the osseous and soft tissue structures which are notable for
 a mid thoracic compression deformity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process, noting limited frontal
 exam due to poor inspiratory effort.
