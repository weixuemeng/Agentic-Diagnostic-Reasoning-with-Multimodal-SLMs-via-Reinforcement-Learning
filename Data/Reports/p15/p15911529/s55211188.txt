 pleural effusion has increased, and is now moderate in size.  A rounded
 airspace opacity in the right upper lung zone likely reflects fluid in the
 major fissure.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Lingular linear atelectasis is
 again noted. New blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a small
 pleural effusion.

 New small left pleural effusion.
 Stable cardiomegaly.
