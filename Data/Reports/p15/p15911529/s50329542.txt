 chills.  // R/O pleural effusion, CHF exacerbation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since prior, there has been interval enlargement of a right-sided pleural
 effusion which is now moderate to large with associated atelectasis.  Left
 chest wall triple lead pacing device is again noted. There is no left-sided
 effusion. Linear opacity in the left lower lung is likely atelectasis versus
 scarring. There is vascular congestion, lungs are otherwise clear of
 consolidation.  Previously seen pneumothorax is no longer visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval enlargement of the right pleural effusion and pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Please note that underlying infection at the right lung base
 cannot be excluded.
