 Right basilar pleural pigtail catheter remains in place. There is a tiny right
 apical pneumothorax.  The heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are
 stable. A left-sided pacer remains in place.  There is patchy opacity at the
 right base which may reflect re-expansion pulmonary edema, although patchy
 ateclectasis or pneumonia should also be considered.  A rounded contour to the
 right medial lung base may reflect prominent epicardial fat when correlated
 with abdominal CT studies from ___ and ___, although a medial lung nodule
 cannot be entirely excluded.  This can be re-assessed on followup imaging.  No
 large effusions.
