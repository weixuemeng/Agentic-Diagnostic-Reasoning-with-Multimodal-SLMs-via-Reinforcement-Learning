                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Exam is technically limited due to flexed position of the head and
 neck resulting in obscuration of the left apex and superior mediastinum. 
 Additionally, marked rotation of the patient also accentuate mediastinal
 structures.  Widening of upper mediastinum appears to be due to mediastinal
 lipomatosis as evident on CT torso of ___.  Heart size is
 normal, and pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Lungs are clear except for
 linear opacities at the lung bases, which may reflect atelectasis and/or
 scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Technically limited chest radiograph demonstrating no gross
 evidence of abnormality, but repeat radiograph with improved positioning would
 be helpful to more fully evaluate the mediastinum and left lung apex when the
 patient's condition permits.
