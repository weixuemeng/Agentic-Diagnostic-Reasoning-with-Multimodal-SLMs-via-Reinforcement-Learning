                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with bilateral upper extremity numbness and
 tingling with EKG changes and history of cocaine abuse.  Evaluation for acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes. 
 The upper mediastinum is somewhat prominent, possibly due to mediastinal fat;
 however, slight deviation of the trachea to the right suggests the possibility
 of underlying mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear,
 with no evidence of pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax or focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Upper mediastinal fullness may be due to lymphadenopathy.
