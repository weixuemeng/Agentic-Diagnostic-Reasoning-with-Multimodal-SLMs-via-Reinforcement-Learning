                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Renal disease with transplant.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, accentuated by low lung volumes. 
 Indistinct right hilum and right lower lung zone could reflect pulmonary
 congestion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would
 have to be considered.
