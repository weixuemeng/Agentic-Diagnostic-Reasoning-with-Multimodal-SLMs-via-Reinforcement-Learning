                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of asthma, worsening of
 persistent cough in the past four days, chills, and faint basilar rales
 following inhalation of noxious fumes last week.  Is there pneumonia?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  The heart size remains normal.  No configurational abnormalities are
 identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or
 chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses are free.  No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area on
 the frontal view.  When comparison is made with the next preceding study again
 a small fat pad adjacent to the apical area of the heart contour is noted,
 which is not a pneumonic infiltrate as it appears on both frontal and lateral
 views in typical location and remains unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates in this patient with
 history of asthma and worsening related to inhalation of noxious fumes last
 week.
