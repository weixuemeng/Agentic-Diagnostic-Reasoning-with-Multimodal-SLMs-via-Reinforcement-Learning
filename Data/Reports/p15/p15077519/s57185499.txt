                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left hip fracture status post fixation, hypoxia, pneumonia,
 pneumonitis or other acute process.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  
 
 Rotated positioning.  As before, there is cardiomegaly.  Direct comparison for
 any increase in cardiac size is difficult due to rotated positioning and
 technical differences.  The possibility of some interval increase in the
 degree of cardiac enlargement cannot be excluded.  As before, as well, the
 aorta is calcified and unfolded.   There is a possible small right effusion as
 well as some atelectasis and scarring at the right base superimposed on a
 known elevated right hemidiaphragm.  Possibility of some interval worsening of
 these findings cannot be excluded.  There is new increased retrocardiac
 density with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  No gross left effusion. Left apical
 pleural thickening is more apparent on the current film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Allowing for technical differences, there is new left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation and possible new opacity at the right base, with
 equivocal small right effusion.    Differential diagnosis includes pneumonia
 and aspiration.  Possibility of some degree of CHF superimposed on existing
 background COPD would also be difficult to exclude.
