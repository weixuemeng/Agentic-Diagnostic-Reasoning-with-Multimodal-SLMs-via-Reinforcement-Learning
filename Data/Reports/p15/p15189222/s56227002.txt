                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with active cardiac ischemia as well as CHF. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart and mediastinal contours are stable.  Increased bilateral
 opacity centered around the hilum is compatible with worsened pulmonary edema,
 now severe.  Bilateral instinct costophrenic angles remain compatible with
 small pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  No pneumothorax. 
 Sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsened pulmonary edema, now severe, with small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
