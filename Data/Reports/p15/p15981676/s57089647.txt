                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with cough retrocardiac opacity on AP film, rule out
 consolidation, pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The main reason for the left lower lobe opacity is due to small pleural
 effusions and atelectasis.  Mild cardiac congestion is unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Left hemodialysis catheter ends in mid SVC.  Mediastinal and
 cardiac contours are top normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 The main explanation for the left lower lobe increased density is due to
 layering pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Superimposed pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.
