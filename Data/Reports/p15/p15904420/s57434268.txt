                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative, to assess for fluid status.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the aberrant Dobbhoff tube has
 been removed.  Atelectatic changes are again seen at the bases.  Specifically,
 no definite evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 An area of increased opacification is seen at the right base medially.  This
 could well represent vascular crowding or mild atelectasis.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia could be considered.
 
 Nasogastric tube is now in place and extends to at least the distal esophagus,
 where it crosses the lower margin of the image.
