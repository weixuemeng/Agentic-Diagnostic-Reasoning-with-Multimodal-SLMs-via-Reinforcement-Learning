 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 Compared with ___ at 4:56 a.m., no significant change is detected.  An NG
 tube is again seen, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  As before, the
 tube extends to the left of midline through the mid mediastinum, unchanged. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  The aorta is unfolded.  There
 is faint increased opacity at both lung apices and about the paratracheal
 region, which is stable.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt
 CHF.  There is plate-like atelectasis at both bases as well as some increased
 retrocardiac density, which is grossly unchanged.  No effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite change compared with one day earlier.
