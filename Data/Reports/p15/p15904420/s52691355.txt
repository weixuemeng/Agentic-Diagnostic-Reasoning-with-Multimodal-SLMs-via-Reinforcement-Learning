                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___, ___,
 ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A density projecting over the cervical spine and the lower neck is
 compatible with recent anterior cervical spine fusion hardware.  The
 inspiratory lung volumes are decreased.  There is retrocardiac opacification
 of the left lung base predominantly which may reflect atelectasis or
 consolidation.  No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is accentuated due to low lung volumes but is likely related in part to
 technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacification in the setting of low lung volumes
 postoperatively most likely reflects bibasilar atelectasis on the left greater
 than right.
