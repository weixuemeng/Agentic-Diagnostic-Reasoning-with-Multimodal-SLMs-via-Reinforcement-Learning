                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: LLL collapse, likely postobstructive.
 
 COMPARISON: Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___ and chest
 CT performed same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal portable chest radiograph demonstrates partial
 expansion of the previously noted left lower lobe collapse on prior study due
 to lobar collapse.  There is a stable triangular-shaped opacification within
 the right hilus, corresponding with area of collapse better evaluated on the
 ___ CT.  No other opacification is evident.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  No right-sided pleural effusion identified. 
 Enteric catheter courses below left hemidiaphragm and out of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Apparent increased opacification in left lower lung is actually likely due to
 partially improved aeration of the previously completely collapsed left lower
 lobe.
 In the absence of interval intervention, finding may be attributed to
 aggressive chest therapy.
