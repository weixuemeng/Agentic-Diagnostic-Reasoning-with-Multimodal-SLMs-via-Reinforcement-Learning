                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP supine portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is intubated. The carina is difficult to discern but the
 endotracheal tube probably terminates about 2.5 cm above it. An orogastric
 tube courses into the stomach, terminating in the antrum to the right of
 midline. Lung volumes are low. Allowing for technique, the cardiac and
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unremarkable. There is mild perihilar
 fullness bilaterally which is suggestive of venous hypertension. Vague density
 at the left lung base makes it difficult to exclude the possibility of a
 developing opacity there, which would most commonly be due to atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with a mild hilar fullness suggesting pulmonary venous
 hypertension. Vague left basilar opacity, not specific but most commonly this
 would be due to developing atelectasis.
