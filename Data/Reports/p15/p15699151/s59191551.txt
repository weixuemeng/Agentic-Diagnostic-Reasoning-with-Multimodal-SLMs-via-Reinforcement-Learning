                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with dysarthria and weakness, rule out intrathoracic
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Images of chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 There is a slight increase in radiodensity in the right lower lobe with
 increased thickness of peribronchial tissue that is better appreciated on
 lateral view.  The heart is moderately enlarged but stable.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Multiple healed rib fractures are again seen on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity in the right lower lobe with peribronchial wall
 thickening, likely reflective of chronic or recurrent infection such as
 chronic aspiration.
