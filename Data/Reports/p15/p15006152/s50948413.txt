 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p MVC with rib fx  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and chest CT of ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Known work proximal right rib fracture is seen to better detail on recent CT
 of 1 day earlier.  Interval worsening of multifocal opacities in the right
 lung, which may be due to a combination of pulmonary contusion and aspiration.
 Layering moderate right pleural effusion has also apparently increased in size
 and may potentially be a hemothorax in the setting of recent trauma.  No other
 relevant changes.
