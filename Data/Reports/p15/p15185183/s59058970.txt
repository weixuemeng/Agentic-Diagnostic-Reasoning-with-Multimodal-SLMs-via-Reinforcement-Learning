                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lung cancer p/w T6 pathologic compression
 fracture  // Pre-op
 
 COMPARISON:
 Chest radiograph ___.  Outside PET-CT ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are remarkable for right
 paratracheal and right hilar fullness, corresponding to areas of
 lymphadenopathy on outside PET-CT of ___.  . The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  Known T6 pathologic compression fracture is not well evaluated on
 this single portable radiograph and has presumably been assessed by previous
 studies including a PET-CT of ___.  .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute pulmonary abnormality.  Known intrathoracic lymphadenopathy and T6
 pathologic compression fracture have been more fully assessed by a outside PET
 CT of 1 day earlier.  Please refer to the official report of that study.
