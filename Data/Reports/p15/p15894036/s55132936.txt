                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with nausea, cough evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 borderline cardiomegaly and unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Slightly increased
 bibasilar densities likely relate to increased breast attenuation.   There is
 no definite consolidation, pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
