 change? Consolidation worsening?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heterogeneous opacification in the lower lungs is relatively mild and although
 I cannot exclude pneumonia, at least at the right lung base it looks more like
 atelectasis and minimal dependent edema. Severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary and
 mediastinal vascular engorgement have worsened since ___, stable since
 ___.
 
 ET tube and upper enteric drainage tube and right jugular central venous line
 are in standard placements respectively. Pleural effusion if present is not
 substantial.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Sharp definition of the upper margin of the cuff of the ET tube indicates that
 secretions are pooling above that.
