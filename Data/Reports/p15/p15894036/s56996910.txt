 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube lies
 within the right mainstem bronchus and must be pulled back at least 4 cm. 
 This information was discussed with the resident on call by the Radiology
 resident. Opacification in the retrocardiac region is consistent with
 substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Opacification at the right
 base is consistent with some combination of pleural effusion and atelectatic
 changes.
