 appropriate clinical setting.  The right lung is essentially clear. No
 pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. No acute
 osseous abnormalities.  An enteric tube terminates in the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New left lung base opacity, which could be due to a small pleural effusion
 with adjacent atelectasis or to pnemonia/aspiration pneumonia.
