 contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Trace
 left pleural effusion is present.  There is no pneumothorax.  Nodular density
 projecting over the fifth posterior rib medially measuring approximately 8 mm
 may lie within the bone or within the pulmonary parenchyma.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left pleural effusion.  No radiographic evidence for
 pneumonia.  8 mm nodular density projecting over the fifth left rib medially
 may represent an osseous lesion such as a bone island, or possibly a pulmonary
 nodule.  Oblique views are recommended for further evaluation.
