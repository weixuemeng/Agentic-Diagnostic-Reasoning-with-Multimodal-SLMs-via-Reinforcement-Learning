                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with abdominal aortic
 aneurysm repair.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable.  The widespread parenchymal
 consolidations have progressed in the interim and might be concerning with
 developing infectious process and less likely pulmonary edema, although the
 latter can be considered as well.  Bilateral pleural effusions are present. 
 No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.
