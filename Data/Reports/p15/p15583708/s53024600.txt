                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Bilateral
 perihilar and basilar areas of consolidation have slightly improved in the
 interval, and may represent a combination of pulmonary edema and multifocal
 pneumonia, particularly given the appearance on CT of ___, which
 favored an infectious process.  No visible pneumothorax, but left lung base
 including left costophrenic sulcus have been excluded from the study, limiting
 assessment for left basilar pneumothorax and pleural effusion.
