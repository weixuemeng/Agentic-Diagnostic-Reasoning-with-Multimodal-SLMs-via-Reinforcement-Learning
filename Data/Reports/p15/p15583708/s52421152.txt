 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion, history of recent multifocal pneumonia,
 evaluation for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is little overall
 change.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema persist.  There is no
 new parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.  However, there is increasing
 atelectasis at the left lung bases.  No larger pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.  Clips over the right lung apex and sternal wires are in
 unchanged position.
