                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, leukocytosis and crackles, evaluation for
 pneumonia or pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 slightly increased, presumably reflecting improved ventilation.  However,
 areas of atelectasis are still seen at both lung bases.  There is no evidence
 of pulmonary edema.  Known calcifications in the left lung apex.  Borderline
 size of the cardiac silhouette with massive tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 Status post CABG.  Marked scoliosis, leading to asymmetry of the rib cage.
