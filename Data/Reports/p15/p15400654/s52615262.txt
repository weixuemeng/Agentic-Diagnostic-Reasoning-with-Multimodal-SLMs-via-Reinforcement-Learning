                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Cardiomegaly and mediastinal position are similar.  Left upper lobe
 scar like
 tissue is similar to previous examination and can be seen with minimal changes
 dating back to ___.  Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged
 since ___, moderate.  Slight interval improvement in pulmonary
 edema is demonstrated.
 
 Nodular opacity adjacent to the scarring changes in the left upper lung
 can be seen on several prior studies, but appears to be more dense and
 potential progression in this area is suspected.  Assessment with chest CT
 would be justified.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF exacerbation  // Resolution of pleural
 effusions and pulmonary edema?      Resolution of pleural effusions and
 pulmonary edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly and mediastinal position are similar.  Left upper lobe scar like
 tissue is similar to previous examination and can be seen with minimal changes
 dating back to ___.  Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged
 since ___, moderate.  Slight interval improvement in pulmonary
 edema is demonstrated
 
 More nodular opacity a adjacent to the scarring changes in the left upper lung
 can be seen on several prior studies but appears to be no more dense and does
 potential progression in this area is recommended.  Does assessment with chest
 CT would be justified.
