                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with dyspnea and lethargy  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior films with most recent chest x-ray from ___, and
 dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is left apical pleural thickening and scarring with associated volume
 loss and superior retraction of the left hilum.  Calcified left hilar nodes
 are again noted.  New perihilar opacities are noted on the right greater than
 left as well as blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle suggesting
 underlying effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged given
 differences in positioning and technique.  Severe degenerative changes noted
 at the shoulders bilaterally.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Perihilar opacities, right greater than the left with a right pleural
 effusion.  Findings are suggestive of pulmonary edema noting that infection
 would also be possible.  Chronic changes involving the left lung apex.
