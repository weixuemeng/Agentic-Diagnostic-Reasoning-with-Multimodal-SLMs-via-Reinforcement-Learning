                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and palpitations.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There
 is mild calcification of the aortic arch.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Patchy opacities within the left lung base are nonspecific but
 could reflect areas of atelectasis or infection.  Blunting of the costophrenic
 angle on the left posteriorly suggests a trace pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacity in the left lung base could reflect an area of infection or
 atelectasis with probable small left pleural effusion.
