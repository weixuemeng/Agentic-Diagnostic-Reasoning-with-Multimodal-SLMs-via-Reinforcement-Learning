                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of sarcoidosis, on chronic steroids.  Chronic cough and
 the one month of back pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again noted are moderate to severe increased interstitial markings
 at the bases which extend to the pleural surfaces.  There is associated
 pleural thickening in these areas.  The previous skin biopsy site at the right
 base with a small residual pneumothorax has resolved since ___.  In general,
 there has been no significant progression of the fibrotic changes.  There are
 no pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  The aorta is mildly elongated which can be expected in
 this age group.  There is no consolidation.  The osseous structures are 
 unremarkable, specifically there are no compression fractures of the vertebral
 bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Stable moderate to severe fibrotic changes at the bases without pleural
 effusions or pneumonia.
 2.  No vertebral body compression fractures.
