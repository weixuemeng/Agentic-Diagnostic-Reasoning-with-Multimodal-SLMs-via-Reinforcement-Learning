                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sarcoidosis  // sarcoidosis     
 sarcoidosis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are extensive
 fibrotic changes at the bases extending to the pleural surfaces with
 associated pleural thickening.  The findings are consistent with extensive
 sarcoidosis. Mild prominence of the azygos region could reflect nodal
 enlargement, although there are not the bilateral changes and mediastinal
 nodes characteristic of sarcoidosis (though these typically regress when
 significant interstitial disease develops).
