                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Improving
 left retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis or resolving infection in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  Lungs are otherwise clear, and there are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
