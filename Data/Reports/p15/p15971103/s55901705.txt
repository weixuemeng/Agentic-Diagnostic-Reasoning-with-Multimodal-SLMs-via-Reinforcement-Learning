                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  Question infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac size is top normal.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.  A
 retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis but underlying infection
 cannot be excluded.  There is no large pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis, but infection in the
 correct clinical setting should be considered.
