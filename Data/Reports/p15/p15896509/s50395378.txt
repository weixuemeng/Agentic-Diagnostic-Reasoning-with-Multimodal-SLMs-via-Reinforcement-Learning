 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The heart size is
 unchanged, and top-normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Streaky opacity in the
 left lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  An approximately 1 cm nodular
 opacity within the right lung base persists, unchanged.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is visualized.

 Minimal left basilar atelectasis.  Unchanged approximately 1 cm right basilar
 nodular opacity for which a chest CT is recommended, as noted on the prior
 report.  No evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
