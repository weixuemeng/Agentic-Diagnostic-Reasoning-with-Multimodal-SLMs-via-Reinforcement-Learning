                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ? empyema  // resolution of effusion,
 worsening?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 04:50
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study and allowing for differences in technique, I
 doubt significant interval change.
 
 Again seen is chest tube at the right lung base, with a small effusion and
 underlying atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The tip of a presumed NG tube overlies the medial right lung inferiorly, in
 this patient with a neo esophagus.  Minimal atelectasis and mild patchy
 retrocardiac opacity are similar to the prior film.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
