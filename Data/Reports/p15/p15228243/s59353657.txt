                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p esophagectomy  // check interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are well expanded without new focal airspace opacity.  Left lower lobe
 opacity has improved.  Probable trace bilateral pleural effusions.  A right
 chest tube is grossly unchanged in position.  Heart size is normal. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal, noting an adjacent soft
 tissue density almost certainly representing the neo esophagus.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved left lower lobe opacities, likely atelectasis.  No other significant
 change.
