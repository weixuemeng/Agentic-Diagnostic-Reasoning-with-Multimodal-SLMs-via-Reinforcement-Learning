 Patient is status post esophagogastrectomy.  Lung volumes are low.  Diffuse
 bilateral opacities are likely due to a combination of mild pulmonary
 congestion, small bilateral pleural effusions, and compressive bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Widening of the mediastinum is expected in the postoperative
 setting.  There is interval placement of new pleural drain catheters.  A small
 right apical pneumothorax is appreciated.  Heart size is unchanged.  A feeding
 tube can be followed as far as the gastric pull-through.
