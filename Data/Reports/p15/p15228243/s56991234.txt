                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p ___ c/b R empyema s/p chest pigtail
 placement 2 days ago  // Interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 03:59
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic slightly rotated positioning.  Inspiratory volumes and
 cardiomediastinal silhouette are similar to the prior study.
 
 Pigtail-type catheter is again seen at the right lung base medially.
 
 Allowing for differences in positioning, the appearance of the right lung is
 similar, with pleural fluid and/or thickening along the lower right chest wall
 on the right costophrenic angle and patchy opacity at the right mid and lower
 zones.  The minor fissure is also slightly thickened.
 
 Small left left, there is increased retrocardiac density consistent with left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and minimal blunting of left
 costophrenic angle, overall similar to the prior study.
 
 Doubt significant CHF.
 
 NG type tube overlies the lower right mediastinum in this patient with a neo
 esophagus.  A new tube overlies the left side of the mediastinum, best
 correlated clinically --___ this lie outside of the patient?
 
 Again seen is the right subclavian PICC line tip overlying the uppermost right
 atrium, near the cavoatrial junction.  No obvious pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right pigtail catheter similar in location, allowing for differences in
 positioning.  Appearance of the right lung and pleural fluid is also similar.
 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity is similar.
 
 Tubing overlying the left heart, new compared with the prior study--___
 outside the patient.
 
 Right PICC line overlies the upper right atrium, near the cavoatrial junction,
 similar to prior.
