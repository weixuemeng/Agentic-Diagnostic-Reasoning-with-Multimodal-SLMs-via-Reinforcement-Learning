                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain.  // ? pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which appears mildly enlarged.  A coronary artery stent is re-
 demonstrated.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable.  There
 is crowding of bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema.
 Linear and patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis in
 the setting of low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy and linear bibasilar airspace opacities most likely reflect atelectasis
 in the setting of low lung volumes.  Infection, however, is not completely
 excluded, and consider repeat examination with improved inspiratory effort for
 further assessment.
