                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pneumonia in a patient with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior study.  Right internal jugular vein catheter tip ends in the distal
 superior vena cava and is unchanged in location.  Compared to the prior study
 there is a new retrocardiac opacity.  The cardiac silhouette is slightly more
 prominent compared to the prior study.  The mediastinal contour is normal and
 there is no evidence of pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  No concerning
 osseous or soft tissue lesions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 New retrocardiac opacity could represent overlapping soft tissues; however, in
 the appropriate clinical setting it could represent pneumonia.
