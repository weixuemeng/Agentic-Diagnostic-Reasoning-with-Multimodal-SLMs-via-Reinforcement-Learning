                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of breast cancer, now presenting
 with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Since the prior examination, there has been interval development of left upper
 lobe opacification.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is stable with right
 basilar atelectasis.  There are otherwise no new focal opacities.  There are
 no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable, demonstrating borderline cardiomegaly.  A right-approach
 port has been removed.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New left upper lobe opacification on the same side of known radiation
 treatment, which could either be treatment-related parenchymal changes, though
 infection has a similar imaging appearance.
 
 2.  No pleural or pericardial effusions.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 12:40 p.m. on ___.
