 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi supine chest radiograph ___ 04:13 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Again seen is extensive emphysema with prominent bullous changes particularly
 at the bases.  However, there is increased lucency at the left base with
 slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm as well as increasing infrahilar
 opacity.  Findings therefore raise the possibility of a loculated
 pneumothorax.  Followup imaging is recommended.
 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina.  A left
 subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial
 junction and a nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the
 tip not identified.  No pulmonary edema.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Results were communicated to the patient's nurse, ___, on
