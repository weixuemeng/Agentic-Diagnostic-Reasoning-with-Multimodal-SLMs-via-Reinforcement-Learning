 INDICATION:  ___M s/p intubation, please eval ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:   Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperexpanded.  Increased lucency in the left base is more prominent
 than on previous chest radiographs.  Increased lucency in the right base is
 stable and likely represents sequela of emphysema.  The mediastinal contours,
 hila, and cardiac borders are normal.  Endotracheal tube terminates 6.3 cm
 above the carina.  Left PICC is stable terminating in the low SVC.  No pleural
 effusion.  Enteric tube is unchanged with distal tip coursing out of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
 2. Increased lucency in the left base is more prominent than on previous chest
 radiographs and likely represents emphysematous bulla although if there is any
 clinical concern for pneumothorax, CT of the chest is recommended to further
 characterize.
