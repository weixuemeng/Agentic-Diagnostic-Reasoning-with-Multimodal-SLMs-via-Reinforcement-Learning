                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with subjective fever, cough, and COPD exacerbation 
 // ?Pneumonia      ?Pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Bullous emphysema is extremely severe, with basal predominance raising
 possibility of panacinar emphysema due to alpha one antitrypsin deficiency. 
 There is a very small region of possible peribronchial opacification
 projecting over the lower pole of the left hilus on the frontal view, and over
 the descending thoracic aorta on the lateral.  This could be a very small
 pneumonia.  Oblique views would be helpful in evaluation.
 
 Blunting of the pleural sulci is due to inversion of the displaced diaphragm,
 not pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
