                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is rotated slightly to the left.  Left base retrocardiac opacity
 most likely represents atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal.  Prominence of the main pulmonary artery is seen which may be due
 to underlying pulmonary hypertension.  Degenerative changes are seen along the
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Prominence of the main pulmonary artery raises question of pulmonary
 hypertension.
