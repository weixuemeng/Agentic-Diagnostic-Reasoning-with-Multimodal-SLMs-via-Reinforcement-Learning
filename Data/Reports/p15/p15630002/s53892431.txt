 admit
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been further decrease in
 the left pleural effusion and basilar atelectatic changes, with most of the
 hemidiaphragm well seen.  Streak of atelectasis is seen at the right base with
 blunting of the costophrenic angle again noted.
 Little change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Mild indistinctness of
 pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure, but
 there is no evidence of acute pneumonia or pneumothorax.
