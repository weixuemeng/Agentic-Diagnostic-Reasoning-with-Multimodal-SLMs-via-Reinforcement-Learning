                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  Minimal streaky opacity in the
 retrocardiac region likely reflects atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No frank pulmonary edema is
 demonstrated, though there is mild prominence of the pulmonary vascularity
 that could reflect minimal congestion, relatively similar compared to the
 prior exam.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, not
 significantly changed compared to the prior exam.
