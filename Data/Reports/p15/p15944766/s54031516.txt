 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:38 PM
  Right PICC with tip projecting at the level of the high superior vena cava. 
  Cardiomegaly, as previously, with low lung volumes and increased retrocardiac
  density, which likely represents atelectasis, but other consolidative process
  cannot be excluded.  Obscuration of the right heart border may be due to
  overlapping densities, less likely small left pleural effusion.  Findings
  discussed with ___ by phone at 18:37 on ___ at the time
  of wet read request.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Preoperative evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 right-sided PIC line.  The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the
 line projects over the mid SVC, there is no evidence of complications, notably
 no pneumothorax.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly.  No pulmonary edema.  Mild atelectasis in the
 retrocardiac lung regions.  No larger pleural effusions.
