                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fall.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is top normal.  Lungs are essentially clear
 except for questionable atelectasis in the right upper lung, although
 potentially it might reflect pleural scarring.  Right upper lobe opacities
 projecting over the medial head of the clavicle and also can represent
 parenchyma versus pleural abnormalities.  Multiple rib fractures on the left
 are noted with associated pleural scarring.  No pleural effusion is seen.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  No focal consolidations to suggest infection are
 present.  Giving the multiple changes in the right upper lobe and in the
 absence of prior imaging, chest CT might be considered .
