                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p lap chole, now with rising WBC. 
 Evaluate for consolidation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiograph, lung volumes remain low, with unchanged
 moderate to severe cardiomegaly.  Small bilateral effusions are persistent. 
 The left base is slightly better aerated, but a right basilar consolidation
 persists.  No pneumothorax.  Multiple small metallic BBs are again seen in the
 soft tissues overlying the left chest.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Slight improvement in the aeration of the left lung base.  Persistent
 small bilateral effusions.
 
 2.  Persistent right basilar opacity, most likely atelectasis, although
 coexisting infection is not excluded the appropriate clinical setting.
