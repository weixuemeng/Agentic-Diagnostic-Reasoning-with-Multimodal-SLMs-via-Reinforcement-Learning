                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, with NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the nasogastric tube extends
 to the upper stomach with the side hole probably above the esophagogastric
 junction.  The other monitoring and support devices are unchanged.  Hazy
 opacification of both hemithoraces is consistent with layering pleural
 effusions and compressive atelectasis, more prominent on the right.  Continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with probable elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure.
