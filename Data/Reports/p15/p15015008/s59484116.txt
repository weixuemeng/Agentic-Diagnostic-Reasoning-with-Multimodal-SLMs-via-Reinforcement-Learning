 FINDINGS:  The right internal jugular central catheter terminates in the right

 diaphgram.  Bilateral opacifications consistent with large pleural effusions
 greater on the right is unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not
 significantly changed.

 1.  NG tube side hole is probably above the diaphragm.
 2.  Right IJ catheter is likely in the right atrium.  Recommend withdrawing it
 3 cm.
