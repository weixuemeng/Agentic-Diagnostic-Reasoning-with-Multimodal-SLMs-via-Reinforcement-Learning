                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and orthopnea.  Evaluate for edema, effusion or
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  A left pectoral pacemaker is
 unchanged in orientation, with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle. The lung volumes are exceedingly low, which results in crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures.  There are, however, new, small bilateral
 pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 moderately enlarged.  Opacification at the bases is likely atelectasis,
 although, pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: New small bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema.
