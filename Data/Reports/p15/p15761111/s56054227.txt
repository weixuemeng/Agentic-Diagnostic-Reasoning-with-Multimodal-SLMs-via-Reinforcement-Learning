                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p motorcycle vs. car now w/poly trauma
 including multiple rib fractures and left ptx on previous imaging  // left rib
 ___ fx, please reassess pneumothorax     left rib ___ fx, please reassess
 pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, overlying structures
 make it difficult to assess for pneumothorax, though no large pneumothorax is
 identified.  There is extensive subcutaneous gas along the lateral chest wall,
 especially in the lower chest and upper abdomen.  Multiple rib fractures are
 again seen.  Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels again is consistent with
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure, most likely due to over hydration.
 Endotracheal tube remains in good position.  There has been placement of a
 nasogastric tube that extends at least to the antrum.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr.  ___.  The patient is doing well and there is no
 evidence clinically of bronchial disruption.
