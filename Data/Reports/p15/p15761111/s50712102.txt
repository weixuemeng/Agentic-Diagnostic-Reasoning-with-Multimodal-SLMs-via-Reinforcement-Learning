                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p MCC, helmeted, medflighted p/w b/l rib frxs sternum frx,
 L comminuted ant pubic ramus frx, L open distal femur fracture s/p left femur
 ORIF  // post CT removal
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the left-sided chest strain.  No
 pneumothorax seen.  There is a moderate left pleural effusion with left
 basilar atelectasis.  This is similar to slightly decreased in size when
 compared to the prior study.  A right-sided PICC terminates in the mid to
 distal SVC.  Prominence of pulmonary vasculature with patchy airspace
 opacities is consistent with a mild pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax seen.
