 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Since most recent exam, there has been

 essentially clear.  There is subtle right basilar opacity similar to previous
 exam from ___ which may represent atelectasis however early infiltrate
 is not excluded.  Mild indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature seen on the
 current exam without frank edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as

 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Right basilar opacity potentially due to
 atelectasis however clinical correlation necessary to exclude infection.
