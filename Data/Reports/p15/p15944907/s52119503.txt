                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Encephalopathy, placement of NG tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Two separate portable views were obtained.  On view #1, the radiopaque portion
 of the NG tube overlies the lower esophagus.  On a second view, which is not
 actually labeled as a second view, the radiopaque tip of the NG tube overlies
 the gastric fundus.
 
 A left IJ central line is present, tip over distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 Rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, there is cardiomegaly, with left
 ventricular cndiguration.  There is prominence of the right paratracheal soft
 tissues, which likely reflects vascular ectasia in someone of this age.  There
 is upper zone redistribution, consistent with mild CHF.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No gross effusion.  
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 NG tube tip is thought to overlie the gastric fundus, but should be correlated
 clinically as 2 separate views, with 2 separate NG tube positions, are
 provided.
