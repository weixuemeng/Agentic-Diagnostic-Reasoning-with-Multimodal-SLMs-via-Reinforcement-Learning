 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:38 PM
  LSC unchanged. Interval dramatic increase in pulmonary opacities most
  compatible with mod-severe pulmonary edema. Trace effusions may be present. If
  concerned for infectious process, consider repeat imaging after diuresis. No
  Ptx. ___ d/w ___ ___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:56 P.M. ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath and desaturation. 
 Assess for pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Extensive pulmonary opacification, greater in the right lung, has progressed
 significantly since ___.  Given moderate chronic cardiomegaly and
 mediastinal vascular engorgement, this could be explained by asymmetric
 pulmonary edema or, since consolidation is much more pronounced in the right
 lung where there is even a nodular quality above the level of the minor
 fissure, this could be concurrent disseminated infection and pulmonary edema. 
 Small right pleural effusion is presumed.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left
 subclavian line ends in the upper SVC.
