                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after intubation and
 sedation, assessment of the old G-tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier.
 
 The old G-tube is not seen.  The right internal jugular line and the ET tube
 tip position are unchanged.  There is mild retrocardiac opacity noted.  Mild
 atelectasis in the perihilar areas present.  Overall, no substantial change
 since the prior study demonstrated but the extent of pulmonary edema is less
 severe.
