 As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has been
 slightly advanced. The tip of the tube now projects 2.5 cm above the carina. 
 No evidence of complications. The position and course of the left internal
 jugular vein catheter is unremarkable.
 
 The lung volumes have slightly decreased, causing crowding of the vascular
 structures at the lung bases. However, short term radiographic monitoring
 should be performed to exclude the possibility of developing pulmonary edema.
 No pleural effusions. Unchanged mild retrocardiac atelectasis.
