                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status, left IJ central line placed.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 left internal jugular central venous catheter is seen terminating at the
 SVC/brachiocephalic junction.  If this is the same catheter that was present
 on ___, it is more proximal in position as compared to the prior
 study.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There are low lung volumes. 
 Obscuration of the diaphragms may be due to small pleural effusions and/or
 atelectasis.  There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature suggesting mild
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left internal jugular central venous catheter terminates at the
 SVC/brachiocephalic junction without evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Low lung volumes.  Obscuration of the diaphragms may be due to small pleural
 effusions with overlying atelectasis.
 
 Enlargement and indistinctness of the hila and increased perihilar opacities,
 while may be accentuated by low lung volumes, also suggest component of mild
 edema.
