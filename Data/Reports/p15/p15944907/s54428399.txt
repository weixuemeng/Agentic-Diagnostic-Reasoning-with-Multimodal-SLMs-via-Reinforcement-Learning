 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 Radiograph centered in the lower thorax was obtained to assess for placement
 of a nasogastric tube, which terminates in the distal stomach.  Stable
 cardiomegaly accompanied by worsening pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Exclusion of the lung apices limits assessment for pneumothorax, but no
 pneumothorax is evident within this limitation.
