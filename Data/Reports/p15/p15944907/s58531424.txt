 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and confusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The film is somewhat blurry owing to motion artifact.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are probably unchanged.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Within the limitations of technique, the lungs
 appear clear.  A right-sided PICC line has been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
