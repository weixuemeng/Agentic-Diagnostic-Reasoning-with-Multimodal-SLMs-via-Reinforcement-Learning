                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Self discontinued left antecubital PICC line.  Assess for acute
 intrathoracic injury.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The right IJ line and left PICC line are no longer visualized. No pneumothorax
 or linear density to suggest retained catheter fragment identified in the
 field of view.
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  Prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Bilateral
 effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation including pronounced
 retrocardiac density.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Interval removal of left PICC line and right IJ line. No pneumothorax or
 retained catheter fragment identified.
 
 2) Bilateral effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation grossly
 unchanged, allowing for technical differences.
