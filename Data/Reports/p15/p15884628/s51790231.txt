 CHF?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The pulmonary vessels are increasingly
 engorged and indistinct, consistent with increasing pulmonary edema.  The left
 hemidiaphragm is slightly better seen, suggesting some improved aeration of
 the left lower lobe.
