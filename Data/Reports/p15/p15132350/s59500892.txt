                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluation for worsening pulmonary edema.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is both rotated and leaning foward which limits assessment.  Again
 seen is a right internal jugular venous catheter terminating in the mid SVC. 
 An endotracheal tube is again seen in standard position.  A feeding is tube
 passes into the stomach with tip below the field of view.  
 
 Comparison is difficult however there is minimal increase in bilateral
 airspace opacities consistent with mildly worsening pulmonary edema. Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contours are grossly unchanged.  There is no appreciable pneumothorax
 however the patient's chin is obscuring the apex of the left lung.  
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild to moderate interstitial pulmonary edema, minimally worse than on the
 prior exam.
