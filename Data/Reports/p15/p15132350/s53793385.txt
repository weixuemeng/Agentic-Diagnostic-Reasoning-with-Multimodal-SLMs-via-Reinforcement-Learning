 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:07 PM
  Interstitial opacities and septal lines, particularly in the right lung are
  new since ___ today and compatible with flash pulmonary edema.  Appropriate
  position of the right IJ central line on this limited rotated exam.  No
  pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Unresponsive episode, central line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:08 (patient is listed as EU Critical at
 the time of study interpretation).
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is rotated slightly which limits assessment. Right internal
 jugular central venous catheter tip appears to terminate in the mid SVC.  
 Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position.  Orogastric tube tip is within
 the stomach, though the side port is at the level of the gastroesophageal
 junction and should be advanced.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  Increased interstitial opacities diffusely are slightly more
 pronounced on the current exam, which may reflect mild pulmonary edema.  Hazy
 opacification in the right lung base likely reflects a small layering pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Multilevel degenerative changes are
 noted in the thoracic spine with compression deformity of a low thoracic
 vertebral body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the mid SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 2. Orogastric tube tip is within the stomach with the side port is at the
 level gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced.
 
 3. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Small right pleural effusion is likely
 present.
