                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette with some indistinctness of engorged pulmonary
 vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Continued
 opacification at the right base is consistent with pleural effusion and
 atelectasis.  Less prominent atelectasis and effusion may well be present on
 the left.
