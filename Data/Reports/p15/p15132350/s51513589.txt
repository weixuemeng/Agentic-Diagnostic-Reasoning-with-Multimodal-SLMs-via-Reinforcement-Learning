                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and hypoxia. 
 Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP and lateral chest radiographs. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low but not significantly changed compared with
 prior exam.  There are diffusely increased interstitial markings, with some
 associated plate-like atelectasis in both bases. Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle might be related to small pleural effusion with associated
 scarring, unchanged from prior.  Streaky left base retrocardiac opacity may
 represent atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.  The aorta is
 tortuous with severe atheorsclerotic calcifications.  Diffuse osteopenia is
 re-demonstrated.  Degenerative changes of both shoulder joints are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with interstitial pulmonary edema with
 possible left base atelectasis.
