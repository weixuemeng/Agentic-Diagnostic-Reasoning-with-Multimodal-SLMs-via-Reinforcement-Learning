                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known right pneumothorax, now with increasing respiratory rate. 
 Assess for increasing pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest CT and CTA neck from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 is a moderate right pneumothorax, and substantial upper pneumomediastinum and
 subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and upper chest wall, likely not
 significantly changed compared to the prior CT from ___, allowing
 for differences in modality.  There is no significant shift of the mediastinal
 structures to suggest tension physiology.  There is minimal bilateral lower
 lung atelectasis.  The heart is normal in size.  A small right pleural
 effusion was better seen on the prior CT.  There is no left pleural effusion. 
 Extensive subcutaneous air is seen along the right chest wall and left
 cervical region, as seen on prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate right pneumothorax, likely similar in size compared to the prior
 CT from ___.
 
 2.  Pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema upper chest wall and neck.
