                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with ICH and now with hypoxia  // eval for CHF/pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CT from earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.
 Patient is known to have moderate layering pleural effusions which partially
 layer posteriorly accounting for lower lung projected opacities.  There is
 likely compressive lower lung atelectasis.  There is possible mild hilar
 congestion.  The upper lungs appear well aerated.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant change in bilateral moderate layering pleural effusions with
 compressive lower lobe atelectasis.  Mild hilar congestion difficult to
 exclude.
