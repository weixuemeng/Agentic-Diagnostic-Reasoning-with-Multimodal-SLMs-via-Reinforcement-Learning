                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with TAVR, MRI with concern for stroke  // eval for
 acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is similar.  The aorta is tortuous.
 Patient is status post TAVR, in unchanged position.  Diffuse increased
 interstitial opacities are re- demonstrated suggestive of chronic interstitial
 lung disease.  More focal opacities within the lung bases likely reflect areas
 of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No definite
 pulmonary edema is identified.  Partially imaged is lumbar spine fusion
 hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar patchy atelectasis superimposed upon a background of chronic
 interstitial lung disease.
