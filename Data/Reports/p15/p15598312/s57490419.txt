                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with nasogastric tube, check position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The nasogastric tube still projects with its tip over the stomach.  The
 right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position with its tip in the
 proximal to mid SVC.  Left chest tube remains in place.  There is persistent
 patchy opacity at the left base likely with an associated effusion.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is elevated.  There is interval improvement in appearance of the
 interstitium consistent with resolved pulmonary edema. Consolidation at the
 left base may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia should also be
 considered.  No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  Clips in the right upper quadrant are
 consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
