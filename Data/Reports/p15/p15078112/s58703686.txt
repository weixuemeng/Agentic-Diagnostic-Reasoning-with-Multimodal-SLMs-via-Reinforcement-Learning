                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new diagnosis of AML with fever, not on
 chemotherapy yet.  // r/o PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear except for a small linear
 opacity in the left lower lung at the level of the fifth anterior rib.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Linear opacity in left lower lung favors atelectasis, but an early focus of
 pneumonia is also possible in this immunosuppressed patient.  Short-term
 followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
