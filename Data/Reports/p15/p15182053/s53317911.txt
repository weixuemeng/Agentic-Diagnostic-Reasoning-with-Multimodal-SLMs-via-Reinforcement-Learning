                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath after recent surgery.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There are streaky basilar
 opacities most suggestive of minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear
 clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky posterior basilar opacities, more suggestive of
 atelectases than pneumonia, although early infection is difficult to entirely
 exclude.
