                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the Dobbhoff tube extends to
 the upper stomach.  There has been substantial increase in opacification
 bilaterally, predominantly in the bases, consistent with developing pulmonary
 edema.  Cardiac silhouette is much more prominent, though some of this could
 reflect the AP rather than PA technique.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
