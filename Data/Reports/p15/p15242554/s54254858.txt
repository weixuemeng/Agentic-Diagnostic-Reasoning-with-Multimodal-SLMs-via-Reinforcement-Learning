                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and right-sided abdominal pain, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 AP upright and lateral radiographs were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are
 well expanded.  Diffuse interstitial abnormality with a mild basal
 predominance and confluend could be pulmonary edema, but mild, chronic
 cardiomegaly is unchanged and there is no pulmonary or mediastinal vascular
 engorgement.  Therefore, both pneumonia and non cardiac edema should be
 seriously considered.  There is no pleural abnormality and no godd evidence of
 central adenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema, cardiac or otherwise, atypical infection,
 and more chronic conditions such as drug induced granulomatosis, DIP should
 all be considered.  If findings persist after initial treatment, CT scanning
 would be useful.
