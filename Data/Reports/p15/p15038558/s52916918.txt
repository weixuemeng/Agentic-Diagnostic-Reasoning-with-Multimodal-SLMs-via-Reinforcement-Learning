  Persistent bibasilar opacities likely due to scarring given persistence over
  time. There is however new hazy opacity at the right lung base which could
  represent a superimposed infection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with petechiae.  Evaluate for evidence of
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to prior, there has been no definite interval change. Linear
 opacity in the right midlung is again seen as well as linear bibasilar
 opacities. These may be chronic and due to scarring given persistence over
 time. Although, there is subtle increased opacity projecting at the right lung
 base which could represent a superimposed process. Superiorly, the lungs are
 clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Surgical
 clips project identified in the upper abdomen. No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent bibasilar opacities likely due to scarring given persistence over
 time. There is however new hazy opacity at the right lung base which could
 represent a superimposed infection.
