                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multifocal pneumonia with pulmonary edema after fluid resuscitation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration.  The right jugular catheter has been removed.  Diffuse
 areas of pulmonary opacification are seen bilaterally.  Much of this may well
 reflect persistent but slow clearing of pulmonary edema.  However, areas of
 more coalescent opacification in the right upper, right lower, and left lower
 lung zones could represent developing areas of consolidation.
