                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with left lower lateral chest pain.  Evaluate for rib
 fracture versus left lung infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Chest CTA from ___ as well as
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded without focal consolidation. Lateral
 left upper lobe scarring/chronic osseous change is stable since ___. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The aorta appears
 tortuous.  Apparent prominence of the ascending aorta compared with the recent
 chest radiograph is likely due to a slight difference in position, and is
 unchanged from scout views obtained during chest CTA performed in ___.  No
 cardiomegaly is present.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced rib fracture
 seen.  If high clinical concern, consider chest CT or dedicated rib series.
