                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG. Evaluate for effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  
 
 Rotated positioning.  Detail blurred by ? motion and overlying soft tissues.
 Multiple sternotomy wires are present, with probable propsthetic valve. ?
 residual epicardial lead. A Dobbhoff-type tube is present coiled in the
 stomach, with radiopaque tip overlying the fundus or proximal stomach.  Right
 IJ catheter (?dual-lumen catheter) is present, tip overlying upper RA. Left
 subclavian central line tip over mid SVC.  No pneumothorax detected.  
 
 There are patchy opacities in both lungs.  Some of this may represent some
 residual CHF, though focal opacity in the left upper zone raises the question
 of focal pneumonic infiltrate or aspiration.  There is continued left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle is unchanged. A small left effusion cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, unchanged.
 2.  Patchy opacity, left upper zone -- ? residual CHF vs aspiration or
 pneumonic infiltrate.  Attention to this area on followup films is requested.
 3.  Dobbhoff coiled in stomach with radiopaque tip over upper stomach.
