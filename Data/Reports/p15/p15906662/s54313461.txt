  Again noted is an opacity overlying the left apex which in the post-surgical
  setting may be representative of hemorrhage and/or fluid with adjacent
  atelectasis/collapse. Otherwise, little change compared to the prior post-
  operation radiograph from the hour before with moderately severe pulmonary
  edema, cardiomegaly, and post-surgical changes.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after CABG with mitral
 valve ring placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained the same day earlier.
 
 The intra-aortic balloon pump was adjusted, currently its tip approximately 2
 cm above the carina.  The Swan-___ catheter is at the level of right
 ventricle outflow tract.  The appearance of tubes and lines is unchanged. 
 Bilateral upper lobe consolidations are redemonstrated.  The appearance is
 most likely representing a combination of pulmonary edema with potential left
 upper lobe collapse.  No pneumothorax is seen.
