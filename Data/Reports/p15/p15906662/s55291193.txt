                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess lines intubated patient.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 There is a new right subclavian catheter with tip in the superior cavoatrial
 junction.  There is no pneumothorax.  Aeration of the upper lobes bilaterally
 is improved.  Bibasal atelectasis larger on the left side have minimally
 increased.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged allowing
 the difference in positioning of the patient.  Lines and tubes remain in place
 in standard position.  Mild vascular congestion has minimally improved.
