                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with new right IJ and new left
 subclavian.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is new right IJ which terminates in the distal SVC.  New left
 subclavian line is seen abutting the mid SVC. The prior left IJ line is
 perhaps in a presistent SVC given its configuration, however is unchanged from
 prior radiographs. Existing right subclavian line is in unchanged position. 
 Lung volumes are again low.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Vascular
 congestion is somewhat improved.  Bilateral atelectasis as well as
 retrocardiac atelectasis is also somewhat improved.
