                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, status post MI.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Rotated positioning.  A Dobbhoff tube is present, with a loop extending off
 the film.  The radiopaque portion of the Dobhoff tube overlies the stomach,
 though the distalmost edge of it extends beyond the film.  A right IJ central
 line tip overlies the SVC/RA junction.  There are sternotomy wires and ?
 overlying drains.
 
 There is cardiomegaly, with an apparent prosthetic valve.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  There is a
 more confluent opacity in the left upper zone.  There is left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, with retrocardiac density and obscuration of
 left hemidiaphragm.  A small left effusion cannot be excluded. There is
 minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle. No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobbhoff coiled in stomach, with tip overlying the stomach.  Please see
 comment above.
 2.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette grossly unchanged.
 3.  CHF with interstitial and alveolar edema, possibly minimally improved
 compared with ___ at 7:51 a.m.  Opacity in left upper zone may represent
 alveolar edema, though the possibility of an infiltrate cannot be excluded. 
 Attention to this area on followup films is requested.
 4.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, essentially unchanged.
