                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Status post aortic repair, evaluation for effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the
 pre-existing left pleural effusion has minimally increased.  As a consequence,
 the pre-existing areas of left atelectasis have also increased.  Unchanged
 borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Slightly improved ventilation of
 the right lung, with resolution of the pre-existing right medial basal
 atelectasis.  No right-sided pneumonia.
 
 The nasogastric tube and the right hemodialysis catheter are in unchanged
 position.
