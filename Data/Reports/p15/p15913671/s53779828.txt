                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall off bike over handle bars with chest pain and arm pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lungs well expanded and clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  No acute fracture is seen. 
 There is a small bony protrusion along the superior aspect of the distal right
 clavicle, which appears to have increased in size from prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute fracture is seen, however chest radiographs are insensitive for
 rib fractures.  If rib fracture is still clinical concern, dedicated rib
 radiographs with points of tenderness marked with BB markers could be
 obtained.  
 
 2.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 3.  Very small likely osteochondroma along the superior aspect of the distal
 right clavicle.  Recommend montioring in terms of signs and symptoms, can
 obtain radiographs if it becomes symptomatic.  Recommend advising patient to
 avoid palpating the area to avoid irritating it.
