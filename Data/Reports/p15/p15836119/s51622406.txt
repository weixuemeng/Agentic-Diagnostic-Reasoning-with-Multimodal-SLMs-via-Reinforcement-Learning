                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever s/p cardiac cath. Assess heart and lungs.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates well expanded lungs.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Subtle opacity projecting over the right
 mid lung is nonspecific and likely represents area of atelectasis. No
 additional focal opacity. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are
 unremarkable. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm on lateral projection is
 noted and may represent evidence of diaphragmatic injury.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is otherwise unremarkable and
 visualized osseous structures are notable for diffuse osteopenia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Subtle opacity projecting the right mid lung is nonspecific and likely
 represents focal area of atelectasis, however clinical correlation is
 recommended to assess for overlying infectious process.
 2.  Elevation of left hemidiaphragm on lateral projection may reflect
 underlying diaphragmatic dysfunction.
