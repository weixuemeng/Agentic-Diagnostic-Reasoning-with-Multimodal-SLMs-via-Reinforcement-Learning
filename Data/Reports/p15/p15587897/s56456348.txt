                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads in satisfactory positions in the
 right atrium and ventricle.  There is persistent moderate elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm.  There are low lung volumes.  Left base patchy opacity
 may relate to atelectasis/chronic scarring, similar in appearance to the prior
 study.  There may be minimal pulmonary vascular congestion without overt
 edema.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
