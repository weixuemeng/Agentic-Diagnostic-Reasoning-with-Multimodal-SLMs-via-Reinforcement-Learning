                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of hypertension and "HLID," presenting with epigastric
 pain and nausea.  Assess for free air under the diaphragm.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size
 and accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is subsegmental
 bilateral lower lung atelectasis.  The heart is top normal in size.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is no free air under the diaphragm.  Scattered
 non-dilated loops of small bowel within the anterior abdomen demonstrate small
 air-fluid levels, best seen on the lateral projection, nonspecific in nature.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Low lung volumes.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 2.  No free air under the diaphragm.
