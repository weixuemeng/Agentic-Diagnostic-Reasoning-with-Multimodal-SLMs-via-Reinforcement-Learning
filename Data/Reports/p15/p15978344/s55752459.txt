                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough, fever, suspected pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal, stable.  Mediastinum is unchanged.  Tortuosity of
 the aorta in upper right mediastinal vessels is unchanged.  It is also
 accentuated by the presence of severe dextroscoliosis.  Lungs are essentially
 clear except for vertical linear opacity in the left upper lung most likely
 representing focal area of atelectasis.  No consolidations worrisome for
 infectious process have been demonstrated.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No definitive evidence of infectious process.
 
 2. Linear opacity in the left upper lung most likely representing atelectasis
 given its appearance and orientation.  Followup in three months for
 documentation of resolution is recommended.
