                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Multifocal
 areas of consolidation involving the right upper lobe and throughout the left
 lung have worsened in the interval.  At least one of these opacities located
 within the lingula has a distinctly nodular configuration.  The nodules are
 presumably due to known metastatic melanoma.  Consolidative changes could be
 due to multifocal infection or hemorrhage.  Moderate-to-large layering left
 pleural effusion has increased in size since the prior radiograph.
