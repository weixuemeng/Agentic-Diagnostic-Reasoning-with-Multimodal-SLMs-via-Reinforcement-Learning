                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Metastatic melanoma, DIC, fevers, and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right PICC ends in the mid SVC.  The lung volumes are low.  The
 known left pulmonary mass appears slightly larger with more indistinct borders
 which may be due to surrounding atelectasis or bleeding.  A hazy retrocardiac
 opacity is most consistent with atelectasis, although may reflect a developing
 infection.  A vague hazy opacity in the right upper lobe likely reflects a
 pneumonia.  There is no definite pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with mild cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right upper lobe opacity is likely pneumonia.
 2.  Retrocardiac opacity is probably atelectasis, less likely developing
 pneumonia.
 3.  Left pulmonary mass has new surrounding atelectasis or possible bleeding.
