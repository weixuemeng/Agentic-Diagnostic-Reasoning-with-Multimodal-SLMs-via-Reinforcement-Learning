                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  No specified indication.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 3:12 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
 appearance of a 4-5 cm rounded opacity in the peripheral aspect of the middle
 left lung.  The left lung volumes remain low.  Overall, also after review of
 the chest CT images from the torso examination performed on ___,
 the known left lung nodule cannot explain for this change.  Given the history
 of hemoptysis in this patient, a repeat CT should be performed to clarify the
 morphological situation.
 
 Known right basal lung scars that are partly calcified.  Unchanged
 normal-appearing right lung.
