 Previous vascular engorgement in the lungs has improved.  As before, there is
 still the suggestion of a small focus of consolidation in the right upper
 lungs sitting on the minor fissure.  Consolidation surrounding the large mass
 in the left mid lung has improved, but moderate left pleural effusion has
 increased.  There is no right pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.  A
 right PICC line ends in the mid-to-low SVC.  No pneumothorax.
