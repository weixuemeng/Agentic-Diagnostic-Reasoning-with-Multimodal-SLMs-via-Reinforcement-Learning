                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Melanoma, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The right lung continues to be normal.
 
 The left lung continues to show one retrocardiac and at least one basolateral
 parenchymal opacity, caused by the combination of both the pleural and the
 nodular change in the left lung, that have been documented on several previous
 imaging studies.
 
 The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of pulmonary edema.
