                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the opacities on the right
 are increasing in extent.  In addition, there is increasing blunting of the
 left costophrenic sinus, potentially indicative of a developing small left
 pleural effusion.  Finally the pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis also
 appears to increase in extent.
 
 The right lung is unchanged.
