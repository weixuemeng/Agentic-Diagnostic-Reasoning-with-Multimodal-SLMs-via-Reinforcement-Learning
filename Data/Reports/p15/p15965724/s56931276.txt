                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of metastatic melanoma, DIC,
 fevers, altered mental status, possible pneumonia, and left pulmonary mass for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs including the most recent from
 ___ as well as outside hospital chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right-sided PICC line is visualized with the catheter tip at
 mid SVC.  Lung volumes remain low.  There are multiple densities overlying the
 left lower lobe. These densities are likely representative of the previously
 visualized spiculated left pulmonary mass, left pleural thickening involving
 the major fissure, and post-surgical changes at the left lung base.  The
 previously noted retrocardiac opacity remains stable. No distinct
 consolidation is noted in the right upper lobe.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Stable appearance of densities overlying the left lower lobe likely
 representative of the previously visualized spiculated left pulmonary mass,
 left pleural thickening involving the major fissure, and post-surgical changes
 at the left lung base.
 
 2.  Faint retrocardiac opacity remains stable and may represent atelectasis
 versus a developing pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.
