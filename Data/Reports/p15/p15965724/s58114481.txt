                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with metastatic melanoma
 and pulmonary nodules with new DIC.  
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 There is slightly decreased prominence of the left mid lung nodule, that might
 potentially reflect interval resolution of perinodular bleeding.  Heart size
 and mediastinum are stable.  Minimal opacity at the left lung base is
 unchanged.  Right PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
