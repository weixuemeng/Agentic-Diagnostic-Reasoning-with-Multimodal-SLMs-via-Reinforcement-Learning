                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness, question pneumonia 
 
 COMPARISON:  None available 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate moderate enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  Increased
 opacification in the right lower lobe could reflect a combination of edema and
 atelectasis; although, infectious process is possible.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema 
 
 2.  Increased opacity in the right lower lobe could reflect combination of
 edema and atelectasis; although, infectious process is possible. Consider
 repeat radiograph after diuresis to exclude pneumonia.
