                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, history of esophageal cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged with right
 mediastinal bulge compatible with known neoesophagus.  Previously noted
 air-fluid level within the neoesophagus is not seen on the current exam. 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation is demonstrated.  A small right pleural effusion persists,
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary vascular congestion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent small right pleural effusion.  No new focal consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.
