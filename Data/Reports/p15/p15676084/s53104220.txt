                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after esophagectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ CT torso and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.   Dilated esophagus on the current radiograph is
 demonstrated obscuring the right mediastinal contour.  It should be correlated
 with patient's symptoms to exclude the possibility of potential obstruction. 
 Lungs are essentially clear.  No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  No definitive bone abnormalities noted.
