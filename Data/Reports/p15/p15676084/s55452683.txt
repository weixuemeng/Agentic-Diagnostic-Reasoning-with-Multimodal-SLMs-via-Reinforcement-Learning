                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with recent minimally
 invasive esophagectomy and new tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ obtained at 08:29 a.m.
 
 Since the prior study, there is interval development of small right apical
 pneumothorax (that has demonstrated to be decreased in size on the followup
 examination).  There is no evidence of interstitial pulmonary edema.  Bibasal
 areas of atelectasis are stable.  Small amount of pleural effusion is seen
 bilaterally.  The neoesophageal contour is within the expected limits.
