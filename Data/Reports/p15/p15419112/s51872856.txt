                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  PICC line malfunction.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided PICC line has been withdrawn since ___.  The
 tip projects over the upper-to-mid SVC.  Aeration of the right upper lobe has
 improved.  There is no evidence of residual right upper lobe collapse.  A
 known right upper lobe mass is better seen on CT.  Left-sided hilar mass is
 unchanged.  Hazy opacity over the left hemithorax and elevation of the left
 hemi-diaphragm suggests persistant left upper lobe collapse.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right PICC line withdrawn to upper SVC.  Resolution or right
 upper lobe collapse.  Persistant partial left upper lobe collapse and
 bilateral pulmonary masses.
