                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with anaplastic T-cell lymphoma. Worsening
 pleuritic right-sided chest pain, reproducible with palpation, please evaluate
 for right rib fracture versus lytic/blastic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is top normal size.  There is enlargement of the left
 pulmonary outflow tract, likely reflecting pulmonary hypertension. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Lungs are well
 expanded and clear with no focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlargement of the pulmonary outflow tract suggests pulmonary
 hypertension, recommend correlation with echocardiography.
