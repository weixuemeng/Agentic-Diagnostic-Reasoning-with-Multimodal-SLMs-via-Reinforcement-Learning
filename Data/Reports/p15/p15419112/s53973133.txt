                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and wheezing, to assess for consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and no
 evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  There is again some prominence of the
 region of the pulmonary outflow tract.  This can be a normal finding,
 especially in a young patient, though if there are appropriate murmurs the
 possibility of pulmonic valve stenosis must be considered.
