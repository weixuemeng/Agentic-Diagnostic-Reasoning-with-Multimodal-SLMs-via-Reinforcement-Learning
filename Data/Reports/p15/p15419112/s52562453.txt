                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, lymphoma and HIV.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ as well as CT torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including borderline cardiomegaly.  A vague opacity persists in the right
 upper lobe, described as an irregular nodule on the prior CT and not well
 characterized on this examination. There is also patchy opacity in the left
 lower lung, similar to increased compared to prior studies, although it may be
 due to exaggeration or increase in pre-existing minor atelectasis.  There is
 no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity at the left lung base, which may be due to
 increase in existing atelectasis at the site rather than pneumonia.  However,
 particularly if clinical concern for pneumonia persists, standard PA and
 lateral radiographs may be helpful to evaluate further and directly compare to
 earlier studies when clinically feasible.
