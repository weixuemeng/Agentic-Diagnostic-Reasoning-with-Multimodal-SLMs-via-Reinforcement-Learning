                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancreatitis with elevated white count.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette
 remains at the upper limits of normal in size.  No vascular congestion or
 pleural effusion.
 
 There again is some increased opacification at the right base medially, which
 could merely reflect pulmonary vessels.  No area of consolidation is confirmed
 on the lateral projection.  Nevertheless, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 a developing pneumonia could not be excluded.
 
 Of incidental note are multiple healed rib fractures.
