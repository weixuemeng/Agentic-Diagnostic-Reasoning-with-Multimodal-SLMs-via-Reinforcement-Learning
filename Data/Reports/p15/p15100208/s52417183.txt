                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 Comparison with the previous study done ___.
 
 There is ill-defined focal area of increased density in the retrocardiac area,
 silhouetting the descending aorta.  There is persistent streaky density in the
 lingula.  The lungs are otherwise essentially clear.  The cardiac silhouette
 is prominent but may be exaggerated by AP technique.  The aorta is tortuous
 and calcified, as demonstrated earlier.  The bony thorax is grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent focal area of increased density in the left lower lobe
 suspicious for pneumonia or partial atelectasis.  Subsegmental atelectasis
 left mid lung.
