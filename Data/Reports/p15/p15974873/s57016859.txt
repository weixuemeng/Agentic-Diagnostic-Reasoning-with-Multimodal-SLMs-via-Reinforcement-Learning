                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change.  Again
 there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour with its peak
 somewhat laterally, consistent with subpulmonic effusion.  No acute pneumonia
 or vascular congestion.
 
 A central catheter again extends to the mid to lower portion of the SVC.
