  Subtle deformity of the posterior right eighth rib is of indeterminate age and
  could be due to a fracture of indeterminate age.  Consider dedicated rib

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F 5d s/p fall  // ?rib fx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Subtle deformity of the posterior right eighth rib could be due
 to a fracture of indeterminate age; not optimally assessed on this study. 
 Consider dedicated rib series or CT as clinically warranted.  No evidence of
 acute fracture is seen elsewhere.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle deformity of the posterior right eighth rib is of indeterminate age and
 could be due to a fracture of indeterminate age.  Consider dedicated rib
 series or CT, which are more sensitive, as clinically warranted.
 
 Clear lungs without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
