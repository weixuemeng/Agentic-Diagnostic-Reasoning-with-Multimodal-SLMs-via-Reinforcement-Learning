                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ (not fetched).  An earlier set of radiographs is
 available, however, from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The chest is hyperinflated.  The lungs appear clear.  A small density projects
 above the distal right clavicle, possibly an object lying outside of the
 patient, although small soft tissue calcification might be possible.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflation.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
