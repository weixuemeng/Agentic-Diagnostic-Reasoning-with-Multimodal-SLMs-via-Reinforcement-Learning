 AP CHEST, 5:15 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with alcoholic hepatitis after NG tube placement.

 increased since ___.  Findings are consistent with disseminated
 infection, either pneumonia or septic emboli.  The basal abnormalities are
 relatively constant since ___, when an abdomen CT imaging of the lung
 bases showed mainly basal atelectasis.  Pleural effusion is small, judged from
 the same abdomen CT.  Heart is not enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax.  A
 feeding tube ends in the upper portion of non-distended stomach.
