                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:10 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypoxemia, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 4:23 a.m.
 
 A portable semi-supine chest film ___ at 4:10 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at the thoracic inlet.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  The right subclavian PICC line is seen to the level of the
 proximal SVC.  Lung volumes remain low and there continues to be a layering
 effusion on the right with probable associated compressive atelectasis. 
 Patchy opacity at the left base likely reflects atelectasis given the low lung
 volumes.  Crowding of vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.  Hardware is
 seen overlying the lower cervical spine.
