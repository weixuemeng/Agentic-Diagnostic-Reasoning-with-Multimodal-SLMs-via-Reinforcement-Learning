 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  ARDS, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.
 The lung volumes remain very low.  Areas of atelectasis continue to be seen at
 both lung bases.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  The presence of
 small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  No new focal parenchymal opacities.
