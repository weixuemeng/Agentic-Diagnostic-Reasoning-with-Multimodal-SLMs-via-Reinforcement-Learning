                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pressure radiating to the
 back, assess mediastinum.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung volumes are
 somewhat low, with mild ground-glass opacity within both lungs, which could
 represent underpenetration and crowding of bronchovasculature, though the
 possibility of mild edema is not excluded.  The heart is mildly enlarged. 
 There is no focal opacity concerning for pneumonia.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contour appears normal.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly with possible mild pulmonary edema. 
 Mediastinum appears normal.
