                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Left lung collapse post-procedure, question re-expansion.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 There continues to be complete opacification of the left hemithorax with
 mediastinal shift to the left.  This is even more dense than on the prior film
 from two days ago suggesting increased fluid and decreased aeration on the
 left.  The right lung shows some interval partial clearing of the alveolar
 infiltrate which is still present but is somewhat improved.  Endotracheal tube
 and NG tube have been removed.  Again seen is a catheter overlying the left
 chest.  It is unclear if this is a subclavian line and slightly low in
 position for that but appears similar compared to prior.
