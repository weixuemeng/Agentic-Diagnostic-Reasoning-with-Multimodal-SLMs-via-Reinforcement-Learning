                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with non-small cell lung
 cancer and pneumonia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained on
 ___ at 4:06 p.m. and chest CT from ___.
 
 The complete opacification of the left hemithorax with mediastinal shift is
 due to central occluding mass in the left hilus.  Substantial lymphadenopathy
 involving the entire mediastinum is redemonstrated.  The consolidation at the
 mid portion of the right lung is consistent with known infectious process
 associated with pleural effusion.  Overall, no substantial change since prior
 radiograph is demonstrated.
 
 The right PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
