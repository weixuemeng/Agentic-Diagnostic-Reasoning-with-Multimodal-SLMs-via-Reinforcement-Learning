                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Progressive dyspnea on exertion, wheezing, and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the left perihilar region is a large mass-like opacity with
 irregular borders which is new from the prior radiograph.  Elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragm suggests volume loss and probable obstruction in the region
 of the mass.  At the right base there is a stable 5 mm dense nodule.  There is
 no edema, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Aggressive appearing left perihilar mass with associated volume
 loss.  Recommend CT scan for further evaluation.
