 A dual lead left-sided pacemaker device appears intact with 1 tip ending in

 slightly low, perhaps secondary to lack of full inspiration.  The lungs are
 clear.  No pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or focal consolidation.  The heart
 is normal in size.  No pulmonary edema.  The descending thoracic aorta is
 slightly tortuous or ectatic.  The mediastinum is not widened.  Hila are
 within normal limits.
