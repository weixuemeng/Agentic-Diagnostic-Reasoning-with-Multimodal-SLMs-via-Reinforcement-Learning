                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and altered mental status, here to evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the most recent prior study, there is a new left
 basilar opacity obscuring the left heart border and left hemidiaphragm. 
 Lucency in the bilateral lung apices is consistent with emphysematous change. 
 No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal in size but unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 New left basilar opacity may reflect underlying consolidation from infection
 or aspiration.
