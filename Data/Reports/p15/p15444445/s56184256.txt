                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Emphysema is severe.  An subtle opacity in the right suprahilar
 lung is the mass seen on torso CT.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains
 stable.  The pulmonary vasculature is mildly prominent in the lower lobes and
 likely physiologic but a mild case of edema cannot be excluded.  The lungs are
 without a new focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  No acute
 fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process with an opacity
 again noted in the right upper lobe and better delineated on dedicated CT
 torso from ___. The pulmonary vasculature is mildly prominent in the
 lower lobes and likely physiologic but mild case edema cannot be excluded.
