                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Alcohol intoxication, history of COPD, now with cough
 and crackles on exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the interval since the prior study, there has been development
 of a right upper lobe opacity which while could represent infection, given
 underlying COPD, malignancy is not excluded.  Again seen there is relative
 lucency of the upper lobe and interstitial prominence consistent with
 pulmonary emphysema.  Left base linear opacity may be due to
 atelectasis/scarring.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of right upper lobe/right apical opacity,
 could represent infection, given underlying COPD/pulmonary emphysema,
 malignancy is not excluded.  Findings could be further assessed on CT.
