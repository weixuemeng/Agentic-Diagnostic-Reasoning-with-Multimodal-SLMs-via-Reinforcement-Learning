                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall yesterday, bony tenderness on right side, evaluate
 for rib fracture, pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced
 fracture is seen, however if clinical concern for rib fracture is high,
 suggest dedicated rib series which is more sensitive.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced rib fracture is
 seen, however if clinical concern for rib fracture is high, suggest rib series
 which is more sensitive.
