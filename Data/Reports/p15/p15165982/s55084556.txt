 well.

 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is patchy left basilar opacity which may
 represent pneumonia, but atelectasis and pleural effusion could also be
 considered.  A pleural effusion is suspected but not well demonstrated. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There is no pneumothorax or evidence for
 pleural effusion on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly.  No evidence of congestive heart failure. 
 Left basilar opacification, not specific but which could be seen with
 atelectasis or pneumonia and probably with a pleural effusion.
