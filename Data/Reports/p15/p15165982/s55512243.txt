                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and accompanied by worsening
 vascular engorgement and mild-to-moderate edema.  Small right and moderate
 left pleural effusion are again demonstrated as well as a confluent left lower
 lobe opacity which may relate to atelectasis and dependent edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening congestive heart failure with small right effusion.
 2.  Moderate left pleural effusions with adjacent left lower lobe opacity. 
 This may reflect atelectasis and dependent edema, but coexisting infection
 should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
