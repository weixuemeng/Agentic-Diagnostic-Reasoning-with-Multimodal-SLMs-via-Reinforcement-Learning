                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia followup.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been substantial
 clearing of the consolidation in the right mid zone as well as at the right
 base.  Most of the residual opacification probably represents fibrotic
 scarring in the patient with hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of
 the hemidiaphragms.
