                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough over the past two weeks. 
 Study requested to rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: The heart is normal in size.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal. The lungs are hyperinflated. Diffuse opacities are noted along the
 right upper and right lower lobes. On the left lower lobe, overlying the
 breast, is a subtle area of increased opacity. Cannot determine, however, if
 this finding belongs to the same spectrum of infectious process.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right upper and lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 2.  Subtle opacity at left lung, cannot determine if it belongs to the same
 infectious process.
 
 Radiographic follow-up is recommended in 6 weeks to evaluate for interval
 resolution. 
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ via
