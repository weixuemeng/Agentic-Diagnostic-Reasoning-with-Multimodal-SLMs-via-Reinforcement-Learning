 INDICATION:  ___F with sepsis, altered mental status, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large layering bilateral pleural effusions are present, partially obscuring
 the mediastinal contour.  There is moderate pulmonary vascular congestion with
 mild pulmonary edema.  Nodular opacities in the left mid and upper lungs in
 the right upper lung may represent pulmonary nodules or superimposition of
 structures.  There is no pneumothorax.  A tracheostomy tube appears well
 positioned.  Severe multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Large layering bilateral pleural effusions.  Superimposed lung base
 consolidation is impossible to exclude.
 2. Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion with mild pulmonary edema.
 3. Nodular opacities in bilateral lungs may represent pulmonary nodules or
 superimposition of structures.
