                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia and patient with fever, with good oxygen
 saturation, with pseudomonas in urine.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates
 considerably lower lung volumes when compared to prior studies.  There are
 bilateral lower lobe heterogeneous opacities obscuring the diaphragmatic
 contours.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  A right chest
 wall Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral lower lobe airspace opacities which may simply
 represent atelectasis, however, in the setting of concern for infection,
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
