 WET READ: ___ ___ 6:27 AM
  Low lung volumes.  Bibasilar, left greater than right, areas of airspace
  consolidation are similar to the recent prior chest CT and better evaluated on
  that study, potentially representing septic emboli, fungal pneumonia, or
  multifocal pneumonia. No pulmonary vascular congestion or pneumothorax

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with new O2 requirement, evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___ and chest CTA dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bilateral subsegmental
 atelectasis.  Bibasilar airspace opacities, left greater than right,
 correspond to the chest CT findings of multiple masslike pulmonary nodules
 some with cavitation, potentially representing septic emboli, fungal
 infection, or multifocal pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion
 or pneumothorax.  Cardiac size is top-normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 lymphadenopathy is better seen on prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Bibasilar, left greater than right, areas of airspace
 consolidation are similar to the recent prior chest CT and better evaluated on
 that study, potentially representing septic emboli, fungal pneumonia, or
 multifocal pneumonia.  No pulmonary vascular congestion or pneumothorax.
