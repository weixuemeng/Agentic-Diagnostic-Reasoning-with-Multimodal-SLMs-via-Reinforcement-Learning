                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and chest pain.  History of radiofrequency
 ablation for left upper lobe lesion.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Patient positioning and slight rotation limits evaluation.  The upper trachea
 is deviated toward the right with fullness of the left superior mediastinum
 compatible with known goiter.  Low lung volumes are present.  The heart is
 moderately enlarged but appears relatively unchanged compared to the prior
 exam.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures, but no overt pulmonary edema is identified. A clip
 denoting the previously ablated lesion projects over the left upper lung field
 with associated linear scarring. There is likely minimal bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected.    Numerous left-sided rib deformities are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
