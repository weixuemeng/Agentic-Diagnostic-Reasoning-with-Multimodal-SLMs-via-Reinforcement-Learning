 AP CHEST, 12:12 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia and right apical pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 6:33 p.m.:
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is stable.
 There is more consolidation in the right lung outside the entirely
 consolidated right middle lobe, and suggestion of new consolidation at the
 base of the left lung which might be due to spillover pneumonia originating in
 the obstructed right middle lobe.  Extensive mediastinal and right hilar
 adenopathy unchanged.  No left pleural effusion.  No cardiomegaly.
