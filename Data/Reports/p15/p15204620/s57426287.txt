                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:14 P.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  Right middle lobe pneumonia after bronchoscopy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___:
 
 There is no pneumothorax or appreciable right pleural effusion.  However,
 consolidation in the right middle lobe and more heterogeneous opacification in
 the right lower lobe may have increased since the previous study.  Extensive
 adenopathy in the right hilus and particularly in the paratracheal mediastinum
 suggests two diagnostic possibilities, obstructing malignancy or primary
 tuberculosis.  Left lung is grossly clear and the heart size is normal.
