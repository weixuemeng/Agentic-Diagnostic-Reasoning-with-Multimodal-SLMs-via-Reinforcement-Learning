                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:33 P.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  COPD. Newly diagnosed lung cancer.  Acutely tachycardic and short of
 breath.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Persistently consolidated right middle lobe may have increased in volume since
 ___ raising concern for postobstructive infection, which could also be
 responsible for the increase in small right pleural effusion.  Extensive right
 hilar and mediastinal adenopathy is unchanged.  Left lung clear.  Heart size
 normal.  A skin fold of the right upper hemithorax should not be mistaken for
 pneumothorax.  I have discussed the preliminary report to the contrary with
 the clinical care team, at the time of this dictation.
 
 A substantial increase in shortness of breath could be due to acute pulmonary
 embolism, given the extensive intrathoracic malignancy.
