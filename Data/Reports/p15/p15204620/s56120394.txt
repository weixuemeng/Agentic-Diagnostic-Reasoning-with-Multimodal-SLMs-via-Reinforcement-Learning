                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Non-small cell lung cancer post-obstructive pneumonia,
 evaluate for change.
 
 CHEST: Diffuse opacification of the right lower lung zone is again seen;
 however, the right heart border can now be identified suggesting some clearing
 has occurred at least in the right middle lobe, though the consolidations
 within the right lower lobe persist.  Elsewhere, the lung fields are clear.
 
 The position of the PICC line is good.
