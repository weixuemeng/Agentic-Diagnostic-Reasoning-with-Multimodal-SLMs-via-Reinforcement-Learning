                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of lung cancer and post-obstructive pneumonia.  Evaluate
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  PET-CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right middle lobe consolidation persists and is consistent with
 the patient's known post-obstructive pneumonia.  There is no new
 consolidation.  A small right pleural effusion is unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mild enlargement of the right hilum is consistent with the
 patient's known lymphadenopathy, although it is better evaluated on recent CT
 scan.  The cardiac silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable right middle lobe pneumonia and small right pleural effusion.
 2.  No significant change from prior radiograph.
