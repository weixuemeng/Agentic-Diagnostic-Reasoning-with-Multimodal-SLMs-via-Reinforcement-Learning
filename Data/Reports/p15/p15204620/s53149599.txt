 AP CHEST, 1:50 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Newly diagnosed small cell cancer and post-obstructive pneumonia.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  A skin fold simulated that finding on yesterday's
 chest radiograph.  Small regions of new consolidation in the right upper and
 left lower lobes have improved, perhaps these were areas of atelectasis or
 aspiration.  The right middle lobe remains densely consolidated, and small
 right pleural effusion is stable.  There is no appreciable left pleural
 effusion.  There is extensive adenopathy in the right hilus and in the
 mediastinum extending through the thoracic inlet.  Heart size normal.  Current
 and prior findings were discussed by telephone with the patient's clinical
 care team at the time of dictation.
