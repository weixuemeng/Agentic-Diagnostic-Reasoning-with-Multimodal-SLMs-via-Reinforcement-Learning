                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 21:16
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath, question
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 Single portable AP upright chest film ___ at 21:16 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent consolidation in the right middle and lower lung consistent
 with post obstructive pneumonia.  More focal linear opacity at the left base
 likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely stable.  Soft tissue opacity in the right paratracheal
 region most likely represents lymphadenopathy when correlated with a recent CT
 scan.
