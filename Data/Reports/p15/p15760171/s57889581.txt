                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with symmetrical pain and swelling in small and

 Suggestion of some coalescence of opacification at the bases could merely
 represent atelectasis and scatter radiation related to the size of the
 patient, but in the appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia could be
 considered.

 1. No evidence of TB.
 2. Bibasilar opacification could be atelectasis, scatter radiation, or
 possibly pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
