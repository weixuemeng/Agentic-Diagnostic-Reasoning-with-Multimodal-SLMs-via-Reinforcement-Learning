                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hx of developmental delay and seizure disorder s/p fall
 from ___ stairs with C1 fracture, multiple facial fractures and ARDS from
 presumed aspiration event  // assess interval change    assess interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are
 essentially unchanged.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications are little
 change.  Again this could reflect ARDS as suggested in the clinical history,
 though superimposed pneumonia and vascular congestion concern may not be
 excluded.
 The left hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen.  This could reflect improvement
 in pleural effusion, though it also may merely be a manifestation of a more
 upright position of the patient.
