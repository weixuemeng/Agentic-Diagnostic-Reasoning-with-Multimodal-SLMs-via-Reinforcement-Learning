                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pulmonary edema, history of CHF, on BiPAP
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears moderately enlarged with a large hiatal hernia
 present.  Diffuse calcification of the thoracic aorta is noted.  There is mild
 to moderate pulmonary edema noted with perivascular indistinctness, upper zone
 vascular redistribution, and perihilar haziness.  There is likely a trace
 right pleural effusion.  Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis.  No large pneumothorax is detected.  Multilevel moderate
 degenerative changes are seen within the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema with probable trace right pleural effusion. 
 Large hiatal hernia with bibasilar patchy opacities, potentially atelectasis,
 however infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded.
