  Small right lower lung consolidation could represent a small infectious focus,
  but differential diagnosis includes atelectasis; low lung volumes, patient
  positioning, and frontal view only limit this study. Slightly increased
  prominence of pulmonary vasculature with persistent left mid lung atelectasis.
  Discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 9:10 p.m. on ___.
