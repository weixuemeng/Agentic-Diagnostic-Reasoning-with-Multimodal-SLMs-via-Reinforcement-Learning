 There is a tracheostomy tube, which is unchanged in position.  The heart size
 is upper limits of normal.  There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity
 consistent with known consolidation as seen on the prior CT scan from ___.  Note that the lower aspects of the lung fields have been excluded on
 this field of view.  The right lung is relatively clear.  There are no
 pneumothoraces.  There is a left-sided PICC line whose distal tip is not seen
 well but is at least to the level of the left brachiocephalic vein.
