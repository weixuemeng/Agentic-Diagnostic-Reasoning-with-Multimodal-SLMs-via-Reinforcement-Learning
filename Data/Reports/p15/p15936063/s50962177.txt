                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and tracheostomy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post tracheostomy.  A right-sided PICC line
 terminates in the superior vena cava.  The right lung is better aerated than
 on the prior study, but regarding the left lung, there is persistent
 opacification of the left lower lobe, which may be associated with
 atelectasis, consolidation and probably a substantial pleural effusion.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved opacification of the right lower lobe but persistent
 left basilar opacification suggestive of a combination of atelectasis with
 possible pneumonic consolidation, and suspected moderate pleural effusion.
