                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of stroke with tracheostomy and PEG tube admitted with
 sepsis, here to evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the most recent prior study a right internal
 jugular central venous line and tracheostomy tube remain in appropriate
 position.  The trachea remains narrowed.  There is similar appearance of the
 opacified left lung base silhouetting the left heart border and left
 hemidiaphragm compatible with chronic moderate left pleural effusion and
 associated left lower lobe collapse.  Streaky opacities in the right lung base
 are compatible with atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is incompletely
 evaluated but remains moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal contours
 redemonstrated prominence of the azygos vein and calcification at the aortic
 arch but otherwise appears within normal limits.  No pneumothorax is present. 
 There is increased mild pulmonary vascular congestion from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening mild pulmonary vascular congestion from ___.
 2.  Chronic moderate left pleural effusion and associated left lower lobe
 collapse.
 3.  Stable position of support devices.
