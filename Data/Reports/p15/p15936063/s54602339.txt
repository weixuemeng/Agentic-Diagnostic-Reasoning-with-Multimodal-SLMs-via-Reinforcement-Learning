  1. In comparison to recent chest radiograph from earlier same day at 07:18,
  there is little interval change.  Again seen is evidence of evidence of known
  right hydro pneumothorax and empyema, with a right pigtail chest tube
  projecting in grossly appropriate, unchanged location overlying the peripheral
  right thorax/right costophrenic angle.  Opacification of the dependent portion
  of the right lung is unchanged in appearance.
  2. Unchanged retrocardiac opacity may represent left basilar atelectasis.
  3. Stable appearance of tracheostomy tube.
  4. Left sided PICC line appears in grossly unchanged position, however distal
  tip is difficult to definitively localize.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chronic mechanical ventilation via trach,
 right hydropneumothorax with likely trapped lung, right staph empyema with
 ongoing pleural catheter drainage now with worsening respiratory distress  //
 Assess for change in hydropneumothorax, new infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph of earlier the same date, loculated right
 pleural effusion with indwelling pleural catheter appears unchanged as well as
 adjacent parenchymal opacification involving portions of the right middle and
 right lower lobe.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is also a constant finding
 with mild interstitial edema.  Note is made of apparent slight worsening of
 small to moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent left retrocardiac
 atelectasis and or consolidation.
