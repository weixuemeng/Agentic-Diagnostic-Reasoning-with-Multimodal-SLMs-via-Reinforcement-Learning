 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man in persistent vegetative state s/p hemorrhagic
 stroke, on chronic mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy, history of
 recurrent right pleural effusion now with episodic tachypnea/vent asynchrony 
 // Assess for recurrent pleural effusion, pneumonic infiltrates, pulmonary
 edema    Assess for recurrent pleural effusion, pneumonic infiltrates
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes.
 Tracheostomy tube is in place. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification at the right
 base is consistent with volume loss and moderate pleural effusion. Less
 prominent changes are seen at the left base. In the appropriate clinical
 setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
