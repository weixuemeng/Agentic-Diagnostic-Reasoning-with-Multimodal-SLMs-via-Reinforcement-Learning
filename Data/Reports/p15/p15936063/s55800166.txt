                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable semi-erect AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chronic respiratory failure on long-term
 positive pressure mechanical ventilation, persistent vegetative state s/p
 remote CVA, prior R exudative pleural effusion of uncertain etiology, with
 ___ CXR demonstrating R hydropneumothorax/trapped lung (?)related to
 underlying bronchopleural fistula  // Assess interval progression of
 right-sided hydropneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large right pneumothorax appears overall unchanged from the earliest exam on
 ___ but is increased from the prior.  An apical pneumothorax also appears
 similar and is likely in communication with the large basilar component and
 increasing in size.  The right hemidiaphragm appears more depressed,
 suggesting tension.  Right lung atelectasis with rightward shift of the
 mediastinum is probably overall similar.  Stable left small pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Large right pneumothorax with evidence of tension - chest tube should be
 placed.
 
 2.  Severe right lower lung atelectasis, overall unchanged.
 
 3.  Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Increasing large right pneumothorax was discussed by Dr.
 ___ with ___, NP from IP, on the telephone on ___
 at 11:45 AM; evidence of tension in right pneumothorax was discussed with
 ___ at 12:10 PM, after discovery of the findings.
