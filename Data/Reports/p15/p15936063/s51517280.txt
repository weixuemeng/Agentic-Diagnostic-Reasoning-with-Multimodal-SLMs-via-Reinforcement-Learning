                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible new VAP, assess for interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Compared with ___ at 4:02 a.m., I doubt significant
 interval change.  Again seen are the tracheostomy, right-sided PICC line over
 mid SVC, left base effusion, and underlying left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Also again seen is upper zone redistribution, with probable
 background COPD.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is
 minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, new compared with ___.
