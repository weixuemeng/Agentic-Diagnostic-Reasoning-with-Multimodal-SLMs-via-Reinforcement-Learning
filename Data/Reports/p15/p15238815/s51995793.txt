  NGT follows a normal course in the chest and terminates in the region of the
  stomach, with the tip projecting just beyond the lateral gastric airshadow.
  Given the clinical concern, extraluminal location of the tip cannot be
  evaluated in this study, hence a repeat radiograph after administration of
  water soluble contrast is recommended. ___ d/w dr.___ ___
  after the study at 20:30 hours on ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with NG tube placed returning serosanguineous
 fluid.  Evaluation for NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior images are available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates NG tube along the
 expected course of the esophagus entering the stomach with distal tip
 projecting just past the lateral gastric air shadow.  The lungs are clear and
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 CONCLUSION:  NG tube appears to lie within the stomach; however, given
 clinical concern, extraluminal location cannot be evaluated in this study and
 a repeat radiograph after water-soluble contrast administration is
 recommended.
 
 The above findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at the
 time of discovery at ___ on ___.
