                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chest pain, elevated
 white blood cell count, pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Relative
 lucency along the right lateral hemithorax is felt to be artifactual and
 likely relates to patient's overlying arm.  The left lung is clear.  Overall,
 there are low lung volumes.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable and unremarkable.  No pleural effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lucency along the lateral right hemithorax is felt to most likely be
 artifactual, particularly in the absence of concern for pneumothorax or recent
 trauma.
 2.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia, and no evidence of
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
 
 The above findings were discussed with Dr. ___ via telephone by Dr.
