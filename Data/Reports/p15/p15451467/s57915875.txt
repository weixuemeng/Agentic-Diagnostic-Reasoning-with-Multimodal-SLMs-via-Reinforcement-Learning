                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with a history of seizures, who presents for
 evaluation of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is a vagal stimulator device that projects over the left
 chest wall with the catheter extending to the left neck region.  Again, the
 lung volumes are quite low, which may limit the evaluation in the bases. 
 There is evidence of bibasilar atelectasis.  The mid upper lungs are clear. 
 There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal contours are
 stable.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 No acute changes to suggest interval development of pneumonia.
