                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Seizure activity, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Vagal stimulator
 device projects over the left chest wall with catheter extending to the left
 neck region.  The lung volumes are quite low, which limits evaluation
 primarily in the lung bases.  There is bronchovascular crowding and probable
 mild atelectasis in the lung bases, likely accounting for the subtle opacity
 noted in this region.  No obvious evidence of pneumonia in the lower lungs. 
 No effusion or pneumothorax.  Mid upper lungs are clear.  Heart and
 mediastinal contour appears grossly stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lungs poorly assessed without clear signs of pneumonia or
 CHF.  Please note evaluation limited due to low lung volumes.
