 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ? aspiration pns  // ? PNA      ? PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 tortuosity of the aorta.  No definite vascular congestion.  Opacification at
 the bases most likely reflects areas of atelectasis, possibly with small
 pleural effusions.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
