                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with NCC Lung CA, recently finished rx for PNA, now
 with recurrent cough and mild dyspnea  // Eval for PNA or acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates a right chest port, its tip which
 projects over the anticipated location of the cavoatrial junction.  Linear
 density within the right midlung zone likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis
 though fluid within the minor fissure is a possibility.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable relative to prior examination, the heart which is
 enlarged.  No opacity convincing for pneumonia is present.  There is no large
 pleural effusion.  No evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No opacity convincing for pneumonia.  Interval placement of a right chest
 port.  Probable subsegmental atelectasis within the right mid lung zone may
 alternatively reflect fluid within the minor fissure.
