                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known rib fractures, possible hemothorax on the right.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The previously noted right pleural
 effusion has significantly increased since the prior study, now large in
 extent.  Additionally, a small left pleural effusion is likely present. 
 Multiple right-sided rib fractures are again demonstrated.  The cardiac
 silhouette size appears relatively unchanged, as is the mediastinal contour
 with calcification of the aortic knob.  There is right basilar opacification
 likely reflecting compressive atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is definitively
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased size of right pleural effusion, which is now large in
 extent with right basilar atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion.
