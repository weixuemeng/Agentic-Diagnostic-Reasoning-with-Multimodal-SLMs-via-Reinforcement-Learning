                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple falls with sacral pain.  Evaluate for fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.  CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The lung volumes are exceedingly low, resulting in crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures and accentuation of the mediastinal silhouette. 
 The heart size is normal but increased from the prior study.  Leftward
 deviation of the trachea from the inominate artery is better seen on the prior
 CTA.  Dense calcification is seen within the aortic arch.  There is no pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  A dextroscoliosis of
 the thoracic spine is unchanged.  Old right rib fractures are again seen
 without an acute fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes limiting full evaluation.  No acute fracture.
