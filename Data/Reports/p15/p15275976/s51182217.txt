 DATE:  ___
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pleural effusion, evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  The heart size is now within normal limits.  The thoracic
 aorta is unchanged in appearance and shows rather advanced wall calcifications
 at the level of the arch.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  The
 previously described multiple rib fractures in the right hemithorax located
 posteriorly and involving ribs #3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 appear rather unchanged. 
 The pleural effusion persists but has decreased in size.  No new pulmonary
 parenchymal abnormalities are seen and no pneumothorax is present in the
 apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slow regression of previously described right-sided pleural
 effusion appearing in conjunction with trauma and multiple right-sided rib
 fractures.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is now within normal limits.
