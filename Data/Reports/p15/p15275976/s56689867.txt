                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with right thoracic pain after fall,
 question fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs obtained demonstrate multiple
 displaced right-sided rib fractures spanning the right sixth through tenth.
 There is no definite pneumothorax.  There is opacity in the right mid-lower
 lung which could represent hemothorax and/or consolidation.  The heart size
 remains enlarged, though the pulmonary vasculature appears normal.  The aortic
 arch is mildly tortuous and heavily calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. At least four contiguous displaced right-sided rib fractures.
 2. Consolidation vs hemopthorax causing opacity at the right lower lung.
 CT is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 Findings were discussed with the ___ triage nurse by phone at 3:30 p.m.
