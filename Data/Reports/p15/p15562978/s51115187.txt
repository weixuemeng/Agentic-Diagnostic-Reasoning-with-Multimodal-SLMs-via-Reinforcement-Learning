 out volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A small amount of free air under the right diaphragm is due to recent
 abdominal surgery.  There is mild vessel cephalization without pulmonary
 edema.  This is unchanged.  Left lower lung atelectasis band is stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  There is mild cephalization of pulmonary vessels without pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Free air under the diaphragm is presumed to be from recent surgery.
