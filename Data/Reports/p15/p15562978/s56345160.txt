                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, questionable opacities.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  At the time of dictation, there is no radiographic comparison. 
 Free subdiaphragmatic air on the right, explained by the history of recent
 laparoscopic intervention.  Bilateral areas of atelectasis at the lung bases,
 at overall low lung volumes.  No additional parenchymal opacities that would
 raise the suspicion of pneumonia.  However, given the lack of comparison, a
 short-term comparison should be obtained to reliably rule out infectious
 changes.
 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pulmonary edema.  No larger pleural
 effusions.
