                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of nasogastric tube, terminating within the
 distal stomach, with associated decrease in gastric distention. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Small right apical
 pneumothorax is present, and has apparently increased in size since the
 previous radiograph, but may have been less visible on that study due to
 supine positioning.  Multifocal areas of patchy and linear atelectasis in the
 mid and lower lungs have slightly improved.  More confluent opacity is present
 in the right lower lobe posteriorly, partially obscuring the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Multiple rib fractures are again demonstrated on the right as
 well as subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall and supraclavicular regions,
 slightly improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach; decreased gastric distention
 following placement.
 
 2.  Small right apical pneumothorax and multiple contiguous right-sided rib
 fractures.
 
 3.  Multifocal atelectasis and small pleural effusions.  More confluent
 opacity in right lung base posteriorly could reflect atelectasis, aspiration
 or infection.
