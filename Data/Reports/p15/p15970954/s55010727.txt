                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of right ___ rib fractures, right pneumothorax.  Please
 evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs dated back to ___ and chest
 CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There appears to be a slight interval increase in displacement of
 the posterior right fifth rib fracture compared to the prior exam.  Again seen
 are multiple right-sided rib fractures.  There appears to be slight interval
 worsening of the right apical pneumothorax compared to prior exam.  There is
 stable extensive subcutaneous gas along the right side from the mid abdomen to
 the mid neck, overall unchanged compared to prior exam.  There is stable mild
 cardiomegaly.  Note is made of stable bibasilar atelectasis.  Small left
 pleural effusion is stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent interval increase in the right-sided apical pneumothorax and
 displacement of the posterior right fifth rib fracture compared to the prior
 exam, could be accounted for by differences in technique.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by
