                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  CLL, now with fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with the cardiac silhouette mildly
 enlarged and the aorta calcified and tortuous.  There has been interval
 removal of a right-sided PICC.  In the interval, there is mild prominence of
 the hila which may relate to lymphadenopathy.  There has been interval
 development of streaky opacities in the right lung as well as in the left mid
 to lower lung, raising concern for underlying infection.  Component of central
 pulmonary vascular engorgement is not excluded.
