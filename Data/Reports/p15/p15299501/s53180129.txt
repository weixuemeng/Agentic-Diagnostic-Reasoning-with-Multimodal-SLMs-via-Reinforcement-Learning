                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with distal radius fracture, preop.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is a subcentimeter
 nodular opacity projecting over the anterior right first rib.  The lungs are
 otherwise essentially clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Old healed left lateral eighth rib fracture is identified.  Osseous
 and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Nodular opacity projecting over
 the anterior right first rib, potentially within the bone; however, may
 represent an underlying nodule.  Apical lordotic view suggested.
