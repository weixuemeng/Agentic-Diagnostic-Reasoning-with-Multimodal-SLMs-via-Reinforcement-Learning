 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with wheezing and fever.  History of non-small

 of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates a focal
 consolidation in the left lower lung that is new since the prior radiograph
 from ___ and corresponds to opacity recently seen on prior chest CT from
 ___, and is suspicious for pneumonia.  There is no pleural
 effusion, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  A large hiatal hernia is again
 seen.  Bilateral lung nodules are better characterized on recent prior CT of
