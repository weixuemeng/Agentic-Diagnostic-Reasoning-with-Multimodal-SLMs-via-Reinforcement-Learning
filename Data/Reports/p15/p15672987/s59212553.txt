                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Known lung cancer.  Repeat evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient's known dominant right upper lobe mass is difficult to
 completely ascertain; however, there are clearly parenchymal abnormalities
 within the lungs in the right upper lobe, left upper lobe as well as probable
 right lower lobe, better appreciated on the chest CT.  There is no evidence of
 pneumonia.  There may be a small right pleural effusion.  The cardiac size is
 normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Known malignancy better appreciated on CT, but the parenchyma is
 clearly abnormal in multiple areas.
