                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Non-small cell lung cancer and hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  A
 moderate to large hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again noted.  Ill-defined opacity
 within the right upper lobe is unchanged, and previously described lesion
 concerning for neoplasm within the left upper lobe appears relatively
 unchanged, but better demonstrated on recent CT.  Bronchial wall thickening
 with mild interstitial abnormality within the lung bases likely reflects
 bronchiolitis, perhaps minimally improved compared to the previous CT.  No new
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Bronchial wall thickening with mild interstitial abnormality in the lung
 bases is minimally improved compared to the previous chest CT and compatible
 with improving bronchiolitis.
 
 2. Ill-defined focal opacities in the upper lobes are better demonstrated on
 the previous CT with the left upper lobe lesion concerning for malignancy on
 the prior exam.
 
 3. Emphysema and moderate to large hiatal hernia.
 
 4. No new focal consolidation.
