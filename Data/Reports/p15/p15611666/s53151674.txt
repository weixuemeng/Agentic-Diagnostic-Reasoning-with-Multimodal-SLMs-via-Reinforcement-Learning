                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gangrenous
 cholecystitis now with dyspnea and respiratory desaturation into the 80s, here
 to evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  
 
 Technique:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 In comparison to the remote prior study of ___, there is new opacification of
 the right lung base silhouetting the right hemidiaphragm and right heart
 border without significant associated volume loss suggesting a moderate right
 pleural effusion.  Underlying atelectasis, consolidation or infarction is
 difficult to assess.  A right lateral decubitus radiograph is recommended for
 further evaluation. 
 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is compatible with a small left
 pleural effusion.  Streaky opacification of the left lung base likely reflects
 atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Surgical clips in
 the right upper quadrant are compatible with cholecystectomy.  A prominent
 air-filled loop of bowel in the upper abdomen likely represents large bowel,
 similar in appearance to ___. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New moderate right pleural effusion.  Underlying atelectasis, consolidation or
 infarction is difficult to assess.  A right lateral decubitus radiograph could
 be considered for further evaluation barring clinical concern for pulmonary
 embolism, in which case urgent CTA of the chest is recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings and recommendations were discussed by Dr. ___ with
 Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 12:15 on ___.
