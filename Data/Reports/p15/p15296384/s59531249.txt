 An AP upright chest film ___ at 4:25 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina which is
 unchanged overall given differences in positioning.  Left subclavian central
 line has its tip in the proximal SVC.  Nasogastric tube coursing below the
 diaphragm with the tip and side port projecting over the stomach.  Patchy
 retrocardiac opacity persists and may represent an area of compressive
 atelectasis in the setting of an associated effusion, pneumonia or aspiration.
 Clinical correlation is advised.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged although difficult to
 assess given the lordotic technique.
