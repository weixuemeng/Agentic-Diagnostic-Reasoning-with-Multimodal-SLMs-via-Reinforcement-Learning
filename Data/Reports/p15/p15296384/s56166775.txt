                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:05 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with diabetes, atrial fibrillation, COPD.  Assess
 progression of possible pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Upper lobes are clear.  Left infrahilar consolidation has improved, rendering
 the left hemidiaphragm visible.  Pleural effusion is small on the left if any.
 Right diaphragmatic pleural calcification noted with interest.  Right
 infrahilar consolidation has improved.  Either or both of these could be areas
 of pneumonia or recent aspiration or atelectasis.  Conventional PA and lateral
 chest radiographs would be very helpful.  ET tube in standard position.  Right
 jugular line ends in the right atrium and would need to be withdrawn 2.5 cm to
 re-position it with confidence low in the SVC, if desired.  No pneumothorax.
