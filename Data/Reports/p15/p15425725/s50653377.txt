                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left PICC remains in standard position, and cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable allowing for rightward patient rotation.  Known partial
 right lower lobe atelectasis is difficult to assess in the setting of patient
 rotation, but has likely worsened since the previous study, with associated
 reduction in volume of the right hemithorax and worsening right lower lobe
 opacity.  Left lung is hyperexpanded but grossly clear.  No residual
 pneumothorax is evident.
