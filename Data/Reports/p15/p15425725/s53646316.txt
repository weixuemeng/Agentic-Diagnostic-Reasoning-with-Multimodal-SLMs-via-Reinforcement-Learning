                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Radiation therapy and resection, for ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5 cm above the
 carina.  Again, there is extensive opacification at the right base with a
 characteristic finding for right middle and lower lobe collapse.  This
 information was conveyed to the resident taking care of the patient at several
 minutes previously when the previous image was interpreted.
