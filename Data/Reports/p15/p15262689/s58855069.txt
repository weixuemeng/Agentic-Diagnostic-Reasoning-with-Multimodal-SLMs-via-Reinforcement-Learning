 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Renal failure and worsening of the kidney function,
 evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Prominence
 and indistinctness of the hila and perihilar interstitial opacities suggest
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  There may be trace bilateral pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged.

 cardiac silhouette.
