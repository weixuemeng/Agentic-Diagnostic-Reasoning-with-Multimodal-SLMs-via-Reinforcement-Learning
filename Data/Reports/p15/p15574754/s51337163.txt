 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement, new in the interval.  Persistent hazy opacity within the right

 pleural effusion.  Worsening opacification in the retrocardiac region may
 reflect worsening atelectasis or an additional area of infection, with a small
 left pleural effusion also noted.  No pneumothorax is identified.

 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the low SVC.  Bibasilar
 consolidative opacities concerning for pneumonia and/or atelectasis, with
