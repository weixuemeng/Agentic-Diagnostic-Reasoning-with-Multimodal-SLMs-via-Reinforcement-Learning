                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Again the cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size and
 there is tortuosity of the aorta.  Widening of the right upper mediastinum
 most likely is related to a tortuous vessel.
