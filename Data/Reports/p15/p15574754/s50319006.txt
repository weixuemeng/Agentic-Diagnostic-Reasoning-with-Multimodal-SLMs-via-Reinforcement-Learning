                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:04 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new shortness of breath.  Suspect pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is still present, consolidation at the base of
 the left lung has improved, probably clearing atelectasis or pneumonia.  Left
 pleural effusion is small and unchanged.  Upper lungs show mild vascular
 engorgement, but I doubt that pulmonary edema is present, despite severe
 stable cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax.
