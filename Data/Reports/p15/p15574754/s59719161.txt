                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AMS, hypoxia, c/f ABD infection*** WARNING ***
 Multiple patients with same last name!  // Eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ right-sided dialysis catheter is again seen, with
 lumens terminating in the deep right atrium and in the proximal right atrium. 
 There is a right-sided catheter which terminates at the level of the axillary
 vein, query whether this represents a midline catheter or a high in position,
 migrated PICC.  There are persistent bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
 than right, which may be slightly increased since the prior study.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are grossly stable.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right, which may be slightly
 increased since the prior study.  Left base opacity may be due to combination
 of pleural effusion and atelectasis, but underlying consolidation not
 excluded.
 
 Catheter is seen terminating in the right axilla; query whether a midline
 catheter vs a migrated PICC in inappropriate position.
