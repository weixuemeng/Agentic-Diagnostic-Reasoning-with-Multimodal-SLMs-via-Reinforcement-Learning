                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with lactate ___  // evidence of pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are  stable.  A right-sided
 dual-lumen central venous catheter tip terminates within the proximal right
 atrium and at the junction of the SVC and right atrium, as before.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The pulmonary vasculature is within normal
 limits.  A moderate left-sided pleural effusion is minimally decreased in size
 from the prior examination.  Left basal opacity is again demonstrated.  The
 tip of a percutaneous gastrostomy catheter is noted in the left upper quadrant
 of the abdomen.  No pneumothorax.  There is irregular lucency and compression
 deformity of the right humeral head, suggestive of sever degenerative changes
 with possible avascular necrosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left-sided pleural effusion is minimally decreased in size from the prior
 examination.  Persistent left basal opacity may represent compressive
 atelectasis; however, infection should be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
 
 Irregular lucency and compression deformity of the right humeral head,
 suggestive of sever degenerative changes with possible avascular necrosis. 
 Recommend clinical correlation.
