                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post CABG with chest tubes removed, evaluate
 for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 07:35 hours.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval
 removal of a left chest tube.  There is no definite pneumothorax.  There is
 bibasilar opacity, likely reflecting a combination of atelectasis, and/or
 effusion.  A Swan-Ganz catheter remains inserted through right IJ access
 sheath.  The tip is in the main pulmonary outflow tract.  An endotracheal tube
 is unchanged in position.  An NG tube is not well seen, or as it was
 previously seen passing into the stomach.  Median sternotomy wires are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval removal of left chest tube, no definite pneumothorax on this
 semi-erect portable film.
 2.  Unchanged appearance of support tubes and devices, though the NG tube is
 not well seen below the level of the mediastinum, which may be technique
 related.
 3.  Unchanged bibasilar opacity, likely reflecting combination of atelectasis
 and effusion.
