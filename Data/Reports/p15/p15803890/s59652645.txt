                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates
 progressive increase in a large left and smaller right pleural effusion with
 associated bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains markedly enlarged, the mediastinum remains widened,
 unchanged.  Intact median sternotomy closure wires are again seen.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal without pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Large left and smaller right pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis,
 progressing from ___.
 
 2.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal enlargement, with normal
 pulmonary vasculature, probably reflecting mediastinal fluid accumulation.
