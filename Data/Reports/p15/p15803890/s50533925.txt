                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post CABG with increased work of breathing.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left chest tube remains in place superimposed on the left lower
 lung.  Bibasilar opacity remains, with increased veil-like opacity over the
 right lower lung, likely reflecting worsening effusion.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains moderately enlarged, mediastinal widening is improving over
 time.  The pulmonary vasculature, however, is normal.  An endotracheal tube,
 NG tube, two mediastinal drains, right IJ sheath, Swan-Ganz catheter with its
 tip in the main pulmonary artery, and median sternotomy wires are unchanged in
 appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing right pleural effusion.
 2.  Unchanged appearance of support devices and tubes.
