                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hemoptysis, fever, right lateral chest pain; assess
 pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There has been
 interval development of a consolidation in the lateral right lung base
 compatible with pneumonia.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear and well
 inflated.  No large pleural effusion is seen, though a small right pleural
 effusion is difficult to exclude.  Cardiomegaly again noted with dual-lead
 pacer in unchanged position.  No pneumothorax.  Atherosclerotic calcifications
 along the aortic knob noted.  Bony structures intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of consolidation in the right lower lobe
 compatible with pneumonia.
