 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:21 PM
  No new focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia.  The right upper and lower
  lobe opacities are stable to slightly improved since ___.  Stable
  mild to moderate cardiomegaly.  Chronic scarring or atelectasis obscures the
  posterior costophrenic sulci.  Fractured uppermost mediastinal wire. 
  Calcified and tortuous aorta.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Potential pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 improved, with increased transparency of the lung parenchyma.  At the lung
 bases, notably on the left, there is an area of increased radiodensity, better
 visualized on the lateral film.  In unchanged manner, this area projects over
 the posterior costophrenic sinus.  It is associated with minimal blunting of
 the sinus.  The change is completely constant in extent and severity as
 compared to ___, which makes pneumonia unlikely.  No pulmonary edema. 
 Status post CABG, the sternal wires are in unchanged alignment.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly, moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pneumothorax.
