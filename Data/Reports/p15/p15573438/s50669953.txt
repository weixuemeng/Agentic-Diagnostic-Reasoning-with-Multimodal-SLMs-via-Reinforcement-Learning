  Increased perihilar, right greater the left opacifications and possible new
  trace right pleural effusion.  cardiac silhouette appears enlarged,
  particularly the left atrium.  Opacifications are nonspecific and could
  represent infection or less likely metastasis given the history ; however, the
  distribution of opacifications combined with cardiomegaly and right effusion
  suggest edema as the more likely cause.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hemoptysis and right-sided crackles, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a new parenchymal
 opacity in the right upper lobe and the right lower lobe.  The right lower
 lobe opacity is better visualized on the lateral than on the frontal image. 
 The patient shows no pleural effusions.
 
 No other changes are seen.  Known mild cardiomegaly, constant alignment of the
 sternal wires with a ruptured apical wire.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Newly occurred right upper and right lower lobe opacities, likely
 infectious in origin.  Clearing of the opacities should be monitored
 radiographically after therapy in order to rule out other potential
 differential diagnosis.
