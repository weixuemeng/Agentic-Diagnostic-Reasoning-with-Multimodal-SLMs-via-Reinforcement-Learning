                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with ESRD status post transplant with fever. 
 Evaluation for cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior studies, most recent from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates unchanged
 mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  The superior most sternotomy wire is
 fractured, as it was dating back to ___.  The previously seen right
 upper and lower lung opacities appear improved since the prior study.  No new
 parenchymal opacities are identified.  There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary
 edema or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved right upper and lower lung opacity likely represents
 resolving infection or asymmetric edema.
