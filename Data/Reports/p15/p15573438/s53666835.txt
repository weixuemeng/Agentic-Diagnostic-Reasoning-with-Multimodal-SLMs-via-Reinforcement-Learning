                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recent renal transplant with pain and fever, question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  The patient has had
 there a right IJ central venous catheter removed.  The lung volumes are low. 
 Bronchovascular crowding likely accounts for the subtle haziness over both
 lungs.  No focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart
 and mediastinal contour appears stable.  The imaged osseous structures appear
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.  Abandoned epicardial
 pacing wires project over the right heart.
