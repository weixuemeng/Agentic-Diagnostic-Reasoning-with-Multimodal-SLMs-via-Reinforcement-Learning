                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with w/HCV cirrhosis, variceal bleed. s/p ___
 line  // Please confirm ___ line placement
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right IJ sheath is present.  The tip lies near the point of confluence with
 the subclavian vessel.
 
 Tubing overlies the upper mediastinum in the midline.  If this is an ET tube,
 it lies relatively low, only 1 cm above the carina.  If it is an NG tube, then
 it has not passed beyond the mid esophagus.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is probable mild vascular plethora,
 though this is likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes.  Minimal
 subsegmental atelectasis at the bases.  No focal infiltrate, frank
 consolidation or gross effusion.  No free air seen beneath the diaphragm.  R
 
 Rounded densities overlying the cardiac silhouette adjacent to the descending
 aorta may represent  vessels seen on-end.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Tubing which overlies the mid mediastinum in the midline.  Clinical
 correlation is requested.   If this is an ET tube, it lies relatively low,
 only 1 cm above the carina.  If it is an NG tube, then it has not passed
 beyond the mid esophagus.
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  Possible mild vascular plethora, though this is
 likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  No focal infiltrate or gross
 effusion.
