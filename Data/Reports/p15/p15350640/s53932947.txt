                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with MPE s/p right pleurx placement  // 1L
 fluid out. ? pleurx placement. Unable to see TPC on post procedure film. Pt in
 WPC Farr 1.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The moderate right pleural effusion has continued to decrease compared with
 the immediate prior study from earlier on the same date, and is now small with
 moderate associated atelectasis. A small portion of the PleurX catheter is
 visible projecting over the right heart border, but the catheter course cannot
 be traced from the chest wall. Abdominal radiography will be better able to
 evaluate the catheter course. A right chest wall port catheter tip ends in the
 right atrium. There is no pneumothorax. There is no focal consolidation,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. Heart size is top-normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval decrease in a now small right pleural effusion.
 2. Pleurx catheter course cannot be identified, abdominal radiography
 including the lung bases could be performed for further evaluation.
