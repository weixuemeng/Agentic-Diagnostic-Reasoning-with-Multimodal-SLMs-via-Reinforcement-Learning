                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with MPE s/p right pleurx placement  // Please
 assess if Pleurx is in abdomen or chest. KUB view also ordered.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the immediate prior study of 1 hr before, right base pleural
 effusion has further decreased and associated compressive atelectasis has
 improved. Pleurx catheter still cannot be traced from the chest wall through
 its course. This is better evaluated on the concurrent abdominal radiograph,
 which demonstrates that the catheter is within the chest. Otherwise there is
 little change from radiographs obtained earlier the same day.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Further decrease in size of right pleural effusion and improvement in
 compressive atelectasis.
