 hilar contours are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 No definite rib fractures are noted.  However, if rib fractures continue to be
 a clinical concern, then dedicated rib series with markers at the site of pain
 is recommended.

 these are of clinical concern, then a dedicated rib series with markers at the
 site of pain is recommended.
