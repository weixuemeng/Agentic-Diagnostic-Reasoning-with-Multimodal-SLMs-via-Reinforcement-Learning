 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left chest pain radiating to the left arm with recent stress test.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Interstitial opacification is mildly prominent including
 peribronchial cuffing.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the lower
 lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial prominence.  Correlation with clinical factors
 is suggested.  Possibilities include mild pulmonary vascular congestion but an
 inflammatory process involving the airways could also be considered.
