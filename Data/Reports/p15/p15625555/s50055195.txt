 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Confusion and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is marked new bilateral upper lobe opacification with volume
 loss and new small pleural effusion on the right and moderate pleural effusion
 on the left, with accompanying retrocardiac opacity.  Bilateral perihilar
 fullness suggests coinciding fluid overload, but widespread pneumonia could be
 considered.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New widespread opacification in the upper lungs suggesting either
 multifocal pneumonia or perhaps an atypical pattern of congestive heart
 failure.  Findings include substantially increased bilateral pleural effusions
 with retrocardiac opacification, which is non-specific, atelectasis versus
 pneumonia.
