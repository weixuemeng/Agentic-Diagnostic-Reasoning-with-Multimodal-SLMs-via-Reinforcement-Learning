                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior study available for comparison.
 
 SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Evaluation of the lung apices is limited by the
 head position.  Within this limitation, lung volumes are low.  There is
 basilar atelectasis.  There is no large consolidation. Rounded opacity over
 the lower mediastinum suggests a hiatal hernia.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Imaged portion of the cardiac silhouette is unremarkable.  Mediastinal
 silhouette, hilar contours and pulmonary vasculature are normal.  Osseous
 structures are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic abnormality. Probable hiatal hernia.
