                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  VSD, SVT, question congenital heart disease.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.  No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged.  There is
 very slight prominence of the left ventricular contour.  In addition, the
 right heart border is slightly prominent for someone of this age.   The aortic
 knob is not well delineated on the left side and there is slight prominence of
 the right paratracheal soft tissues.   The pulmonary vascular pattern in the
 lungs is grossly unremarkable.  No rib notching is detected.  No focal
 infiltrate or effusion. Minimal atlectasis right base. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No clearcut abnormality, but there are findings suggestive of a
 right-sided aortic knob and of mild prominence of the right and left
 ventricles.  
 
 2.  No radiographic evidence for pulmonary hypertension.
 
 3.  No acute pulmonary process.
