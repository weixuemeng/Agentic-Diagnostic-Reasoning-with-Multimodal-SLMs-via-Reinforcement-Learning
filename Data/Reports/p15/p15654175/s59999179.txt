                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancreatitis status post NG tube placement.  Evaluate NG tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW CENTERED LOW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 6:07 a.m.
 
 An NG tube is present, the tip and side port lie beneath the diaphragm,
 overlying the mid stomach.  There are some patchy opacities at both lung bases
 with blunting of both costophrenic angles.  Allowing for significant
 differences in technique, the appearance is  slightly worse than on the prior
 film.
