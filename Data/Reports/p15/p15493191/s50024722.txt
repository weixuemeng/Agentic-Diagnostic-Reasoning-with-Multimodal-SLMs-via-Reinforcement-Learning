                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with congestive heart failure, short of
 breath, assess for edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Low lung
 volumes limit the evaluation with bronchovascular crowding likely accounting
 for the subtle lower lung opacities.  There is no evidence of CHF or definite
 signs of pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited due to low lung volumes with no definite signs of CHF or
 pneumonia.  If there is strong clinical concern for lower lung pathology,
 recommend a repeat study with more optimized inspiratory effort.
