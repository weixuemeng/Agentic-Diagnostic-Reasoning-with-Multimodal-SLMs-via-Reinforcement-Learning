                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of recent surgery, cough,
 bilateral leg swelling.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Again, there is blunting of
 bilateral costophrenic angles, suggesting small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 There is also moderate central pulmonary vascular engorgement and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Retrocardiac opacity on the lateral view likely relates to small
 pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis, although underlying
 consolidation cannot be entirely excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.
 2.  Retrocardiac opacity seen on the lateral view most likely relates to
 pleural effusions and atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot be
 excluded.
 3.  Cardiomegaly.
