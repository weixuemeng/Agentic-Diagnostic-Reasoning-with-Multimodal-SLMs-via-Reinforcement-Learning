                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post aortic valve replacement and
 bypass surgery, evaluate for pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Comparison is made with the pre-operative chest examination of ___.  A row of circular wire in midline indicative of recent sternotomy and
 bypass surgery as well as aortic valve replacement.  In comparison with the
 pre-operative chest examination, the heart size has not increased
 significantly.  Appearance of thoracic aorta unremarkable.  Comparison of
 lateral view indicates that the previously existing typical aortic valve
 calcifications have been removed.  Small surgical structures can be identified
 in the area, but no large aortic valve prosthesis is identified.  It is
 presumed that the patient received a non-radiopaque biologic prosthesis.  The
 pulmonary congestive pattern that existed on the pre-operative examination has
 improved and so have the mild degree of pleural effusions and thickening of
 the interlobar fissures normalized.  No new parenchymal abnormalities are seen
 and no major post-operative atelectasis persists.  No pneumothorax in the
 apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory post-operative chest findings.
