 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 On the frontal chest chest radiograph, the lungs are clear. But on the lateral
 view partial obscuration of the diaphragmatic surface of the one of the lungs,
 probably but not definitely the left, is sufficient to raise concern for
 pneumonia and I would recommend oblique views to get additional prospective 's
 of the lower lobes.  The upper lobes are clear.  The heart is not enlarged and
 there is no appreciable pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to ___ by telephone
 on ___ at 3:13 PM, 1 minutes after discovery of the findings.
