                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with progressive CKD and failure to thrive I/ss/o likely
 progressive uremia, presenting at recommendation of nephrologist for HD
 initiation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse interstitial abnormality is consistent with chronic lung disease. 
 Superimposed upon this process are new areas of consolidation within the right
 upper lobe and left lower lobe as well as apparent worsening of diffuse
 reticular opacities have.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Small left pleural effusion is new.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Superimposed upon pre-existing chronic fibrotic lung disease are new areas of
 consolidation in the right upper and left lower lobe, concerning for
 multifocal pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Considering
 associated worsening reticular opacities, differential diagnosis includes
 asymmetrical distribution of pulmonary edema and acute exacerbation of
 interstitial lung disease.
