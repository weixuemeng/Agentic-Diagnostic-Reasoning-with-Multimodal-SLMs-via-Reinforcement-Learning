                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with left chest tube pulled  // eval for
 interval changes, post-chest tube removal
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Following removal of left pleural catheter, a small left pleural effusion is
 again demonstrated, but no visible pneumothorax is evident on this semi
 upright study.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for improving pulmonary edema and
 decreased extent of bibasilar atelectasis.  Right pleural effusion has also
 apparently improved.
