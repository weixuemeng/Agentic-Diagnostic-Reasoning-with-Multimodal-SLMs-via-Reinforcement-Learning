                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with autoimmune hepatitis, now with right lung
 consolidation, s/p intubation for respiratory distress after chest tube
 placement for left pleural effusion drainage  // ET tube placement, interval
 changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, a left pleural catheter has
 slightly changed in position, and previously visualized small left apical
 pneumothorax has nearly resolved.  Considering lower lung volumes on the
 current study, there is otherwise not been appreciable change in the
 appearance of the chest since the recent radiograph.
