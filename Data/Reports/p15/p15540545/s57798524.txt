                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stage IV colon cancer with chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath is noted with tip terminating in the SVC.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Innumerable rounded
 lesions are demonstrated diffusely within both lungs compatible with
 metastatic disease. Overall, the metastatic disease within the lungs appears
 grossly progressed in the interval.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is identified.  No definite osseous metastatic lesions are
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Widespread pulmonary metastases appear progressed compared to the prior CT. 
 No acute superimposed process otherwise clearly identified.
