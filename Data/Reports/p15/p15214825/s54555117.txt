                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sarcoidosis and recent SOB  // assess for
 abnormalities
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased,
 likely reflecting improved ventilation.  As a consequence, the pre-existing
 basal atelectasis, notably on the right, has decreased.  There is no
 convincing evidence for the presence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. 
 Calcified lymph node could be present at the level of the aortopulmonary
 window.  No evidence of parenchymal fibrosis.  No pleural effusions.
