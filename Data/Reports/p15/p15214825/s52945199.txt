 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Known cirrhosis from liver sarcoid with crackles, assess for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  There are low lung volumes.  Bibasilar
 atelectases are larger on the right side.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural
 effusion or pulmonary edema.  Increasing reticulation is most likely due to
 the lower lung volumes.  Repeat radiograph with better inspiration is
 recommended.
