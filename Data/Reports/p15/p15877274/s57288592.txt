                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with enlarged firm lymph node in the left neck
 and hoarseness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 The lungs are clear.  There is no focal consolidation, and no effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal, with
 calcification and mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Pleural surfaces are
 smooth.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. 
 Extensive degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine, with multiple
 bridging paraspinal osteophytes, which account for apparent increased right
 paratracheal density.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Calcification of the thoracic
 aorta and marked thoracic degenerative change are incidentally noted.
