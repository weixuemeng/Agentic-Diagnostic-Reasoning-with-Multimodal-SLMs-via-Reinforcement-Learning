                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath.  Question
 infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Linear opacities are
 identified at the lung bases, most suggestive of atelectasis.  Superiorly, the
 lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Lower cervical
 and upper thoracic anterior spinal fixation hardware is identified.  Soft
 tissues and osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar linear opacities, most suggestive of atelectasis;
 however, infection is not completely excluded, particularly at the left lung
 base.  Clinical correlation suggested.
