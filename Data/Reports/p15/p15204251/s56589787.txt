                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w hx asthma p/w 1 day hx of runny nose, sore throat, cough 
 // eval for consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Increased opacities projecting
 over the lower lungs, less conspicuous on lateral view, possibly secondary to
 underpenetration in the setting of dense breast tissue. Allowing for this
 limitation, no definite signs of pneumonia or CHF. Lungs are somewhat
 hyperinflated. No large effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.
