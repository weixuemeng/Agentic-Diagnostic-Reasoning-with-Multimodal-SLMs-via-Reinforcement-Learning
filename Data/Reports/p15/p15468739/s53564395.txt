                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with left rib cage pain.  Evaluate for fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate clear lungs and
 normal hilar and cardiomediastinal contours.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  No displaced rib fracture
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  No displaced rib fracture is seen.  However, the PA and lateral radiograph
 is insensitive for the detection of subtle non-displaced rib fractures.  If
 there is continued clinical concern, dedicated rib radiographs with a skin
 marker at the location of the patient's pain is recommended.
