                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has been intubated.  Although it is difficult to
 measure the precise distance, the endotracheal tube closely approaches the
 carina and retracting the tube by approximately 2 cm is suggested.  An
 orogastric tube courses into the stomach.  There is better aeration at the
 right lung base.  The pulmonary vascularity is again mildly prominent.  It is
 difficult to exclude retrocardiac opacity noting slight blurring of the
 margins of the left hemidiaphragm, but this appearance may be due to
 difficulty in interpretation due to overlying soft tissue attenuation.  The
 heart remains mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.  The endotracheal tube
 appears to closely approach the carina and retracting the tube somewhat is
 suggested for more optimal positioning.  Improved aeration of the right lung
 base.   Persistent cardiomegaly and mildly prominent pulmonary vasculature. 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___.
