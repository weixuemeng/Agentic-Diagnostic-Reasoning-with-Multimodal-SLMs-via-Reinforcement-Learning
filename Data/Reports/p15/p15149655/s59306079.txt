                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of asthma, obesity, hypoventilation with cough,
 wheezing, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The exam is suboptimal due to some underpenetration of the lung
 fields due to patient body habitus.  Given this, no obvious focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion, although a small
 left pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contours are stable and unremarkable.
