 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  The pulmonary vascularity is again mildly prominent.  There
 are patchy right infrahilar opacities associated with persistent mild
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, most suggestive of minor atelectasis. 
 Overlying soft tissue attenuation obscures parenchymal detail.  It is
 difficult to exclude small pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar mild pulmonary vascular prominence, suggestive of
 pulmonary venous hypertension, seen in the setting of cardiomegaly.  However,
 no definite evidence for pneumonia; patchy right basilar opacity appears
 typical for atelectasis and is contralateral to the symptomatic side.
