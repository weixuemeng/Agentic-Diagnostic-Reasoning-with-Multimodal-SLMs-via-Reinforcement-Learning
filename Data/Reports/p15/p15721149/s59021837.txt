                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with right upper lobe cavitary lesion  // f/u
 size      f/u size
 
 COMPARISON:  Since ___ including chest CT on ___.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lucency at the apex of the right hemi thorax is smaller.  This has been a
 persistent air collection in the pleural space and a small region of residual
 aeration in the upward migrated right middle lobe.  The interval change
 suggests that most of the difference is due to near collapse of the middle
 lobe.
 
 Small right pleural effusion or pleural thickening at the base of the right
 hemi thorax is stable.  Right hilus is chronically retracted, responsible for
 tethering of bronchi in the right lower lobe.  Left lung is hyperinflated but
 clear.  Mild cardiomegaly is new but there is no pulmonary vascular congestion
 or edema.
