                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post right upper lobe resection.  Volume loss and
 homogeneous opacity in the right apex are persistent findings compared to ___, but the the degree of opacification has increased compared to
 earlier radiographs of ___, raising concern for local recurrence. 
 New bibasilar opacities are more confluent in the right lower lobe than the
 left.  Small bilateral pleural effusions have slightly increased in size.  No
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contours are similar, with calcifications at the
 aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New bibasilar opacities may represent aspiration pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  An asymmetrical distribution of pulmonary edema
 is considered less likely.
 2. Gradual increase an opacity in the right apex is concerning for local
 recurrence of lung cancer.
 3. Slight interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Contrast-enhanced chest CT to assess for possible lung
 cancer recurrence
