                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged with extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta
 again noted.  Cavitation with surrounding opacification in the right upper
 lobe with associated apical pleural thickening, architectural distortion and
 volume loss appears unchanged from the previous radiograph.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Remainder of the lungs are clear without new
 focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 Remote left-sided rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar appearance of right upper lobe cavitary lesion with surrounding
 pleural thickening, opacification, architectural distortion, and volume loss. 
 No new focal consolidation.
