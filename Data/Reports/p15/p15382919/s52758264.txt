                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypertension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph single-view.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low which mildly accentuates the cardiac silhouette which
 remains severely enlarged.  Hilar contours are unchanged.  A left-sided dual
 lead pacer remains in unchanged position.  There is increased reticulation and
 opacities within all lung fields compatible with moderate pulmonary edema. 
 Left sided pleural thickening is unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Cardiomegaly with moderate pulmonary edema.  Concurrent infectious process
 cannot be excluded given the correct clinical circumstance.
