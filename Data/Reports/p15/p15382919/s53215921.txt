                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided pacemaker with leads terminating in the atrium and left
 ventricle is in unchanged position.  Cardiac size remains enlarged.  Previous
 right-sided pleural effusion has mostly resolved. Left sided pleural
 thickening/fat again seen, stable. Probable pulmonary edema accounts for some
 of the increased interstitial markings.  There is no convincing evidence of
 pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable pulmonary edema.  No overt evidence of pneumonia.
 Consider repeat after diuresis depending on clincal scenario.
