                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, question pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Dual-lead pacer
 is unchanged.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The lungs are notable for
 diffuse ground-glass opacity which could represent pulmonary edema.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is unfolded though stable in
 overall mediastinal contour.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly
 re-demonstrated.
