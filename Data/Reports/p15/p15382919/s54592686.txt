                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, evaluate for pneumonia, pneumothorax or heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.  Chest CT
 without contrast ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable frontal view of the chest was performed.  A left-sided
 pacemaker is present with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.
 
 There is an increased appearance of the interstitium which is thought to
 reflect mild pulmonary edema, the degree of which is slightly worse than
 prior.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart remains
 markedly enlarged.  A calcified, enlarged and tortuous aorta is again noted
 which also accounts for the rightward deviation of the trachea.  The imaged
 upper abdomen is unremarkable. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: Increase prominence of the interstitium is thought to reflect mild
 pulmonary edema which is slightly worse than prior.
