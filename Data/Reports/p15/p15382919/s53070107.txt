                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of diastolic CHF with continued leukocytosis.  Evaluate
 size of pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, the mild pulmonary edema has improved.  There
 is increased consolidation at the right base.  There are probable stable small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged, with stable severe cardiomegaly.  A pacemaker is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing opacification at the right base, which is likely some
 residual edema and atelectasis associated with a small pleural effusion.  In
 the proper clinical setting, aspiration or pneumonia is a consideration.
