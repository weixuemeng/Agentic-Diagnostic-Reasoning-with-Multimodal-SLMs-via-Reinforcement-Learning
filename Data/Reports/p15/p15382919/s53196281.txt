                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen unchanged in position.  There is
 moderate to marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Patient is rotated
 to the left and there appears to be slight medialization of the calcification
 at the aortic knob.  Left base opacity due to combination of pleural effusion
 and atelectasis in underlying consolidation not excluded.  Pleural thickening
 is again seen along the right mid to lower chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large cardiac silhouette may be due to underlying cardiomyopathy and/or
 pericardial effusion.
 
 Left base opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded.
 
 Apparent medialization of intimal calcification at the aortic knob, underlying
 dissection is not excluded.  Recommend clinical correlation and consider chest
 CTA.  These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 12:00 via
