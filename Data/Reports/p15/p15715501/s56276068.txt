                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever, rule out acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and show a left perihilar alveolar opacity, with
 air bronchograms, in the upper lobe.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar
 contours, and pleural surfaces are normal. No pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left upper lobe opacity consistent with pneumonia.  Recommend follow-up
 radiograph after treatment and resolution of symptoms to confirm resolution of
 the radiographic findings.
