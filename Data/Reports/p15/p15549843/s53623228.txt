                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma status post fall with back pain and right lung
 base crackles on exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is unchanged from prior
 study. Hilar contours are unremarkable. Previously identified retrocardiac
 density is improved compared to prior study. There is trace linear atelectasis
 at the right lung base.  There is re- demonstration of a roughly 1.5 cm nodule
 in the right upper lobe unchanged from the prior examination.  There are no
 definite traumatic findings or focal bony lesions though this is greatly
 limited by diffuse osteopenia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. No traumatic findings or focal bone lesions though this is greatly limited
 by diffuse osteopenia.
 2. Re- demonstration of 15 mm nodule in the right upper lobe which as
 suggested on prior study, should be further evaluated by CT.
 3. Improving retrocardiac density and right base atelectasis.
