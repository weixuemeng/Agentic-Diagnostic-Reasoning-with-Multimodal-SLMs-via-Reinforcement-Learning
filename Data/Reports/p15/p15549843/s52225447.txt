                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with fever, AMS  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 AP views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Exam is limited secondary to patient positioning. There are linear right
 greater than left basilar opacities potentially due to atelectasis. Nodular
 opacity projecting over the left lower lung is compatible with healing
 posterior ninth rib fracture. Cardiomediastinal silhouette has not
 significantly changed given differences in positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam. Streaky right greater than left basilar opacities potentially
 atelectasis noting infection is also possible.
