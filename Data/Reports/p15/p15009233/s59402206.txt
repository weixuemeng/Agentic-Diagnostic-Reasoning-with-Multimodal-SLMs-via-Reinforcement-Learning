 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with severe MR, CHF with mitraclip planned for
 ___  ___/ Pre-procedural eval for mitraclip Surg: ___ (mitraclip)    
 Pre-procedural eval for mitraclip
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 continued pulmonary edema.  The hemidiaphragms are sharply seen bilaterally. 
 This could represent some improvement in pleural effusions and compressive
 basilar atelectasis, though it may only be a manifestation of a more erect
 position of the patient.
