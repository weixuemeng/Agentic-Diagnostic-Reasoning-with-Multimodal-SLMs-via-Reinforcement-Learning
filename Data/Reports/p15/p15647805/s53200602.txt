                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure disorder with left upper lobe mass and new lethargy. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates mild interval
 improvement in aeration of the left upper lobe which is predominated by a new
 left upper lobe mass resulting in bronchial obstruction and consolidation. 
 Lung volumes have reduced since the prior radiograph, resulting in appearance
 of vascular congestion.  Heart size is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval improvement in left upper lobe aeration with
 overall reduction in lung volumes.
