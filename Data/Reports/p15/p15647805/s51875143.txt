                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left upper lobe lung cancer, now status post fall.  Rule out
 pneumothorax/fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to ___, there has been mild interval improvement in
 the aeration of the left upper lobe.  Redemonstrated is a left upper lobe
 mass, as well as findings of post obstructive atelectasis.  Lung volumes
 remain somewhat reduced, resulting in the appearance of vascular congestion. 
 A small pleural effusion is seen on the left.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  The heart size is stable.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  No bony abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No evidence of acute fracture or hemothorax.
 
 2. Stable appearance of a left upper lobe mass, with adjacent atelectasis.
 
 3. Small left-sided pleural effusion.
