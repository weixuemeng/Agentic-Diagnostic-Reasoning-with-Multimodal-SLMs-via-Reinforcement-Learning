 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There are streaky basilar opacities suggesting residual
 minor atelectasis or scarring.  An eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is
 noted with patchy associated right infrahilar opacity most likely attributable
 to coinciding minor scarring or atelectasis.  Patchy vascular calcifications
 are present.  There is no evidence for pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of injury.
