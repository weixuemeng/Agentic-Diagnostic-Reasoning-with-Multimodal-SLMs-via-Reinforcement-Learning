                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.
 Density projecting behind the heart is compatible with a moderate size hiatal
 hernia, similar to prior.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity is compatible with
 atelectasis, although infection is not excluded.  No pneumothorax.  Osseous
 structures are unremarkable.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy retrocardiac opacity compatible with atelectasis, although
 infection cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
