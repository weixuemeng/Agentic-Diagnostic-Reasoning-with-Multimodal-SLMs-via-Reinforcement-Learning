                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain, back pain, neck pain  // ?cpd
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT with the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly, which is shown to represent a pericardial
 effusion on the CT with the same date.  The linear opacities within the lung
 bases bilaterally likely represent atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Small left pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate cardiomegaly corresponds with a pericardial effusion seen on
 same-day CT chest.
 2. Small left pleural effusion.
