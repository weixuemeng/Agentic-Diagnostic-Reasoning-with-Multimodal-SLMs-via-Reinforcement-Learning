                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dizziness and EKG changes  // eval for
 CHF/pneumonia, ICH, intracranial mass
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate severe upper thoracic
 rightward convex scoliosis, likely exaggerated secondary to patient
 positioning. Assessing cardiomediastinal and hilar contours is difficult given
 patient positioning.  Heart size is probably top normal to mildly enlarged. 
 Lungs are clear without a focal consolidation convincing for an infectious
 process.  Emphysematous changes are moderate.  Blunting of bilateral
 costophrenic angles may reflect pleural thickening.  There is no large pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic abnormality.  Emphysematous changes.
