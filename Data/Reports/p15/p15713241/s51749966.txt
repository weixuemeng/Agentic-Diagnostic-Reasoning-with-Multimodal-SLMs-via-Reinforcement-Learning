                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with left anterior chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid/lower SVC.  Right-sided
 dual-chamber pacemaker device is re- demonstrated with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Minimal patchy opacities are seen in the lung bases, likely areas of
 atelectasis.  Known pulmonary nodules seen on previous chest CT are not
 clearly identified on the current radiograph.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are mild degenerative changes
 seen in the thoracic spine.  Clips are noted within the right chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild atelectasis in the lung bases without focal consolidation.  No
 displaced fracture identified, though if there is continued concern for a rib
 fracture, dedicated rib series is recommended.
 2. Bilateral pulmonary nodules seen on previous CT are not well assessed on
 the current radiograph.
