                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with Pacemaker for MRI  // Patient has CIED
 Please evaluate for MRI.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ PA and lateral chest radiographs
 ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules are again identified, better evaluated on
 recent CT.  Hyper expansion of the left upper lobe is again noted. No pleural
 abnormalities.  Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes
 are unchanged.  Dual chamber cardiac pacemaker leads are unchanged in position
 with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Dense aortic
 arch calcifications are again noted.  Known rib lesions are seen to better
 detail on recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Cardiac pacemaker leads terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle.
 2. Numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules reflect known metastatic disease,
 better evaluated on recent CT.
