 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.

 chronic left apical opacity, similar in appearance to the scout radiograph
 from the prior chest CT, likely post treatment changes.  No new focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion is identified.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are unremarkable. Left axillary clip is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.
