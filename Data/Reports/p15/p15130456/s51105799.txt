                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate unremarkable
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  The linear opacifications within the
 bilateral lung bases likely reflect atelectasis due to poor lung volumes.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Poor inspiratory effort limiting evaluation of the lungs.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No cardiomegaly.
