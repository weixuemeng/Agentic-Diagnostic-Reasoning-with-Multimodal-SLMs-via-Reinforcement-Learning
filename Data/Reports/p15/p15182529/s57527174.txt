                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Apparent nodular focus projecting along the right
 lower lung on previous x-ray.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are essentially clear.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Hyperinflation of the upper
 lungs most likely reflects emphysema.
 
 No nodular opacity along the right lower lung is currently demonstrated, most
 likely reflecting nipple shadow on the prior examination.
