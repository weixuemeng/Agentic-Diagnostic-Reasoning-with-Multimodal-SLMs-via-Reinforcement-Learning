                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___ and ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The aortic arch is calcified.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  There is a nodular focus projecting over the right lower
 lung, probably a nipple shadow, although not visualized on prior radiographs. 
 Otherwise the lung fields appear clear.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.  
 
 2.  Newly apparent nodular focus projecting along the right lower lung,
 probably a nipple shadow, although a pulmonary nodule should be considered. 
 When clinically appropriate, repeat PA view with nipple markers is
 recommended.
