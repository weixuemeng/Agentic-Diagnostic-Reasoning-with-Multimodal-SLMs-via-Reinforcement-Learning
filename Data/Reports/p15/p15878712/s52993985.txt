                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation.  Evaluation of ETT position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP chest radiograph demonstrates ETT tip 6.8 cm above the carina. 
 NG tube tip and side hole are both below the diaphragm.  Lung volumes are low
 but there is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ETT tip is 6.8 cm above the carina.  Recommend advancing it 2 cm
