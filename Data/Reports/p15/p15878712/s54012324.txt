                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without
 change.  Lungs are clear except for a questionable well circumscribed nodular
 opacity in the right upper lobe, measuring 2.1 cm in diameter, overlying the
 sixth right posterior rib with scapular overlay in this region limiting
 differentiation between a scapular and lung abnormality.  Minimal blunting of
 left costophrenic sulcus may reflect small left pleural effusion and is
 without change since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable 2 cm diameter nodular opacity in periphery of right
 upper lobe.  With only a single portable radiograph available, it is uncertain
 whether this is intrathoracic or a structure external to the patient.  
 
 Recommend standard PA and lateral chest radiograph for confirmation and
 further localization.  Dr. ___ has been telephoned to discuss this
 finding and recommendation on ___ at 8:22 a.m.  This communication
 occurred at the time of discovery.
