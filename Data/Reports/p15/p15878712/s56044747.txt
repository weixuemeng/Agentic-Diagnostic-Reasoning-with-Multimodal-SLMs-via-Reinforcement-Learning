                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with respiratory failure, now status post
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at ___ hours, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Kyphotic frontal portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval
 placement of an endotracheal tube, the tip of which is located at least 1.5 cm
 from the level of the carina.  Lung volumes are decreased from prior but
 remain within normal limits.  The lungs show unchanged perihilar opacity
 likely the residual of improving pulmonary edema.  The pleural surfaces are
 normal.  The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval intubation, with the tip of the endotracheal tube at least 1.5 cm
 from the carina, repositioning is suggested.
 
 2.  No acute chest abnormality with no change in improving pulmonary edema.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ ___ MICU team at 9:20 a.m.
