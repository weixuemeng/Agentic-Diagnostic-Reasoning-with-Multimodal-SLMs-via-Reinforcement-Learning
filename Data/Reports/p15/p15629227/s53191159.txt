                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation.  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from the same day, as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable frontal chest radiographs demonstrate interval placement of an
 endotracheal tube, which terminates in the mid to upper thoracic trachea, and
 an enteric tube which courses below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of
 the image.  A left chest wall pacer device is unchanged in position.  Heart
 size is likely unchanged.  Diffuse pulmonary opacities are increased compared
 to prior exam.  Pleural effusions are incompletely imaged on this exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminating in the mid to upper thoracic trachea. 
 Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the
 image.
 2. Increased pulmonary opacity bilaterally.  Given short interval since prior
 radiograph, this could represent either flash pulmonary edema or sequela of
 aspiration.
