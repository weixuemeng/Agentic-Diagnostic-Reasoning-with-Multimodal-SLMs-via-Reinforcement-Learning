                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension status post recent catheterization, evaluate for CHF
 exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky opacities along the
 right medial lower hemithorax most likely represent atelectasis; however,
 early pneumonia cannot be ruled out in the correct clinical setting. 
 Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Streaky opacities at the right
 lower medial lung hemithorax most likely represent atelectasis; however, early
 pneumonia is also a possibility in the correct clinical setting.
