                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Septic shock.
 
 Comparison with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Cardiac size is obscured by pleural parenchymal abnormalities. 
 Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion a small-to-moderate right effusion are
 probably unchanged allowing difference in position of the patient.  Widened
 mediastinum is stable.  Tracheostomy is in standard position.  Right PICC tip
 is in the right subclavian vein.  Extensive bilateral lung opacities are
 stable.
