                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient, failed central line, assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 There is no evident pneumothorax.  Right PICC tip is at the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic veins.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  Mild left
 and small-to-moderate right pleural effusions are stable.  There has been mild
 interval increase in right upper lobe consolidation.  Otherwise, diffuse
 bilateral lung opacities greater in the left perihilar region are grossly
 unchanged.
