                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with necrotizing pancreatitis, evaluate for
 pneumonia and free air.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  Small right and
 moderate left pleural effusions are associated with adjacent atelectasis, left
 greater than right.  Ill-defined opacities in the right upper lobe and in the
 left perihilar region are increasing on the left side consistent with
 pneumonia.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  Right PICC tip
 difficult to visualize is at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein.
