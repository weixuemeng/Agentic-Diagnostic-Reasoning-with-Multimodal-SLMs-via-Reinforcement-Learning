 pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no prior chest radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube is in standard placement.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Mild right
 infrahilar consolidation could be atelectasis or, less likely pneumonia. 
 Small right pleural effusion is likely. No strong evidence for pneumothorax,
 although anterior pleural air can be missed on a non erect chest radiograph.
 Thickening of the right apical pleural margin could be bleeding due to local
 chest cage trauma. Mediastinum is not widened.
 
 Fracture in the mid portion of the right clavicle is non healed, could be
 acute.
