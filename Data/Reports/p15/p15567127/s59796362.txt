                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pleuritic chest pain with crackles in the right lung base.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, the most recent chest radiograph is from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small areas of scarring or linear atelectasis persist in the lower
 lungs.  However, the density overlying the right lower lung appears slightly
 increased in comparison to the prior studies and may be representative of a
 developing pneumonia in a proper clinical setting.  Otherwise, the cardiac
 silhouette appears unchanged and within normal limits.  Osseous structures are
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar areas of linear atelectasis/scarring are again noted. 
 However, opacity overlying the right lower lung appears slightly increased in
 comparison to prior study and a developing pneumonia must be excluded in the
 proper clinical setting.
