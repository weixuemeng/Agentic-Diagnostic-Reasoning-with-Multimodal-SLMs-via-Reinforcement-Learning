                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  There is opacity at the medial right lung base
 which may represent confluence of vascular structures, but underlying
 consolidation is difficult to exclude.  There is slight blunting of the
 costophrenic angles particularly on the right and a trace pleural effusion is
 also difficult to exclude.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Medial right base
 opacity may represent confluence of vascular structures given low lung
 volumes, although consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Trace blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may be due to
 overlying soft tissue although trace pleural effusion is not excluded. 
 Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation.
