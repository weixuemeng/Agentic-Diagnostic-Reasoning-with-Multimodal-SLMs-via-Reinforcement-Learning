                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To assess for effusion and atelectasis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the prior study, there again are low lung
 volumes.  However, the opacification at the bases has decreased.  Again there
 is some evidence of atelectasis without definite effusion.
 
 No vascular congestion is appreciated.  Central catheter tip is in the lower
 portion of the SVC.
