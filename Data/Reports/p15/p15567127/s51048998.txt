                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent hospitalization for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 somewhat better inspiration.  There are again bibasilar atelectatic changes,
 though less prominent than on the previous study.  There is an ill-defined
 area of opacification adjacent to the right heart border inferior to the
 hilum.  This could reflect some atelectatic change or conceivably an area of
 consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting, though it is not confirmed
 on the lateral projection.
