                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with ETT s/p intubation
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ 06:39 AM
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Semi-erect portable AP view of the chest are provided. There has been interval
 placement of a endotracheal tube which terminates approximately 1.9 cm above
 the carina. There is no pneumothorax. An enteric tube projects below the left
 hemidiaphragm and terminates in the expected location of the stomach.  Lung
 volumes are low and causes crowding in the central bronchovascular structures.
 Opacities in the lung bases likely represents atelectasis.  There is no large
 effusion.  Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
