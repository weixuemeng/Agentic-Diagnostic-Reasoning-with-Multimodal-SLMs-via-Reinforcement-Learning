                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Urinary retention.  Preoperative radiograph requested.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits. The lung volumes are low.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Patchy opacity at the left lung base suggests minor
 atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lung fields appear clear.  There is prior
 fracture involving the left mid clavicle.  Several mid to lower thoracic
 vertebral bodies show probably chronic mild loss in height.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
