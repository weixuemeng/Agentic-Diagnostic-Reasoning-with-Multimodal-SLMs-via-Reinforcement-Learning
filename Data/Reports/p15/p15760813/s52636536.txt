                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with question of pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified.  Prominence of the left hilar region could suggest underlying
 lymphadenopathy.  Relatively symmetric diffuse hazy opacities are noted within
 both lungs, findings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema, though an atypical
 infection cannot be completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.  Surgical anchor projects over the right humeral head.  Mild
 dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse, relatively symmetric hazy opacities in both lungs may reflect a mild
 pulmonary edema or potentially an atypical infectious process.  Prominence of
 the left hilum may suggest underlying lymphadenopathy.
