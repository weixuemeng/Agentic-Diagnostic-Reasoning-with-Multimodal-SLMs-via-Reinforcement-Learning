 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comparison to ___.  No relevant changes noted.  A minimal increase in
 radiodensity at the right lung bases is likely the result of different patient
 position.  In the interval, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric
 tube was removed.  The right PICC line appears to be coiled in the upper SVC
 and should be flushed.  The known left lateral bulla is stable in size.
