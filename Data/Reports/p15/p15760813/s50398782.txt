 Nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm.  Endotracheal tube unchanged in
 position.  Right subclavian PICC line with its tip in the distal SVC near the
 cavoatrial junction.  Bilateral interstitial abnormality is again seen
 although appears to be somewhat improved, possibly related to difference in
 technique or resolving interstitial edema.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended.  More focal consolidation in the retrocardiac region persists
 which could reflect a combination of parenchymal disease and/or pleural fluid.
 No pneumothorax.
