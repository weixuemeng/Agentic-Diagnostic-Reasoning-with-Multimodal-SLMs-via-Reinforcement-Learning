                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with CP s/p assault  // eval for rib fractures
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear. There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions are identified. There is a chronic
 appearing deformity of the right lateral seventh rib, likely related to prior
 trauma.  There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, which is new from
 the prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation.  No evidence of acute rib fractures.
 
 Of note, this study is not particularly sensitive for the detection of rib
 fractures. Consider marking focal findings and obtaining dedicated rib
 radiographs if clinically indicated.
