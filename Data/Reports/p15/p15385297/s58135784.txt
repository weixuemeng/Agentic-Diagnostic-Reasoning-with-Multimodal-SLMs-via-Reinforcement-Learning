                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left-sided rib pain status post assault.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable, as are the hila contours.  Degenerative changes are seen along
 the spine. No definite rib fracture is seen, however rib series is more
 sensitive.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.  No definite rib fracture, however, if
 clinical concern is high, suggest dedicated rib series, which is more
 sensitive.
