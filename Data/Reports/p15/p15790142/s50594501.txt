                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  AML  // pre bmt      pre bmt
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lungs are well expanded.  2 focal abnormalities in the left lung, projecting
 over the lingula at the level of the fourth anterior rib and in the left upper
 lobe, at the level of the second anterior interspace, are presumably
 infectious. Because there is so little lung involved, the diagnosis is more
 likely fungal or bacterial than PCP.
 
 Heart size normal.  No evidence of central adenopathy or pleural abnormality.
