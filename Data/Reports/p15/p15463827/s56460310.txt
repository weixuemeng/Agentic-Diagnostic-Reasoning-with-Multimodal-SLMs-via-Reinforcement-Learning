                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female on chemotherapy with fever.  Evaluate possible
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to chest CT on ___. 
 Although I presume that a ___-mm wide oval opacity projecting on the frontal
 view over the anterior right seventh rib is the right nipple, and on the
 lateral view, a region of radiopacity projecting over the anterior aspect of
 the mid-to-low thoracic spine is due to osteophytes, I would recommend at
 least oblique chest radiographs to increase certainty that no lung lesion is
 present.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are
 normal.  Vascular clips denote prior left axillary dissection.
