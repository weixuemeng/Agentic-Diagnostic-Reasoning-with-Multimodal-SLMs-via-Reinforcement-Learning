                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Left upper extremity pain, recent CABG, assess for acute
 intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  The right IJ central
 venous catheter has been removed.  The previously noted pneumoperitoneum has
 resolved.  Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar platelike atelectasis is
 again noted, not significantly changed.  No pneumothorax.  No definite signs
 of pneumonia, though given the bibasilar atelectasis, a subtle component of
 pneumonia is difficult to exclude.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change in bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural
 effusions.
