                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged, unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar with atherosclerotic calcifications
 of the aorta again noted.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated
 along with increased size of moderate left and small right pleural effusions. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  Lung
 hyperinflation is re- demonstrated.  No pneumothorax is present.  There are
 diffuse degenerative changes within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with increased size of bilateral pleural
 effusions, moderate on the left and small on the right.
