                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory distress, ? pulm edema and small
 effusion on previous study  // Acute/evolving pulmonary process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain low. The
 pre-existing parenchymal opacity and consolidation in the retrocardiac lung
 regions. With air bronchograms, is not substantially changed. The opacity
 might reflect atelectasis, pneumonia or a combination of both.  No new
 parenchymal opacities. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary
 edema.  No larger pleural effusions.
