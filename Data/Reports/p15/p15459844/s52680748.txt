 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with shortness breath, evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits.  The bilateral
 hila are unremarkable.  Lungs appear hyperinflated with emphysematous changes,
 with likely bullae in the left lung apex.  There are areas of irregular
 scarring and retraction with nodular opacities in the right upper lung.
 Airspace opacities in the right mid and lower lung are consistent with
 pneumonia.  The left lung is clear without focal consolidation.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right lower lobe consolidation.
 2. Irregular scarring and retraction with nodular opacities in the right upper
 lung.  Recommend CT to exclude a neoplastic lesion.
 3. Hyperinflated lungs with emphysematous changes.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Dedicated CT chest for further evaluation of right upper
 lung.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings and recommendation above were discussed by Dr.
