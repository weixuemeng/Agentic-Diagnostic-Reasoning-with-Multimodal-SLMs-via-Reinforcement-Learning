                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PNA, COPD exacerbation  // interval change?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are findings suggests of COPD with increased lucency in the
 bilateral apices consistent with bullous change.  There is a stellate opacity
 in the right upper lobe with associated volume loss.  While this may reflect
 scarring, neoplastic lesion cannot be excluded.  In addition there are
 ill-defined airspace opacities of the right lung base suspicious for
 pneumoniae.  No definite pleural effusion seen although the costophrenic
 angles are not fully visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.
 
 A spiculated opacity with volume loss in the right apex may represent scarring
 but an neoplastic lesion cannot be excluded, recommend CT chest to further
 evaluate.
 
 Right basal consolidation.
