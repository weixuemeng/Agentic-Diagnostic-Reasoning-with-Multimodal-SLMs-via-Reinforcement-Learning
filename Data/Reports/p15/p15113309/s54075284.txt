                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of heart failure with dyspnea and new oxygen requirement. 
 Evaluate for heart failure exacerbation. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___. 
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung
 volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild haziness of
 the bilateral hila, and slight cephalization of pulmonary vasculature,
 consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions with some adjacent atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild haziness of the hilar contours with slight cephalization of
 pulmonary vasculature and small bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with
 pulmonary edema.
