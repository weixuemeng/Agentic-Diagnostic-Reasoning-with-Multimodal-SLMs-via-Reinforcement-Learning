                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p right sided PM implantation  // check for pnx
 and lead location
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In the upper lungs are clear.  Subtle bilateral retrocardiac opacities may be
 of clinical importance however it is difficult to correlate without prior
 studies and are slightly obscured by the hiatal hernia.  Bowel contents are
 traversing the diaphragm through the hiatus and is likely due to a prior
 gastroesophageal surgery.  Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle may represent a
 small pleural effusion or chronic scarring.  The left pleural surfaces are
 normal.  No evidence of pneumothoraces.  The right pacemaker is intact with
 leads located in the right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Appropriate positioning of the right pacemaker leads.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 2.  Bilateral retrocardiac opacities which may represent pneumonia or
 atelectasis.  If clinical concern for infectious process, CT imaging would
 provide superior evaluation.
 3.  A probable small right pleural effusion.
