                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of left shoulder, left
 chest pain, question pneumonia, pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  The right costophrenic angle is not fully
 included on the frontal view.  Given the above, no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Gaseous distention of the stomach is
 noted; on the lateral view, there is an apparent 4.2 cm rounded structure with
 peripheral density of unclear clinical significance, could be within the
 stomach or external to the patient.
