 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Necrotizing pancreatitis, evaluation for pulmonary edema or
 pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain
 low.  There is a minimal pleural effusion bilaterally, with subsequent areas
 of atelectasis at the lung bases.  No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
 pneumonia.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  The right internal jugular vein
 catheter is in unchanged position.
