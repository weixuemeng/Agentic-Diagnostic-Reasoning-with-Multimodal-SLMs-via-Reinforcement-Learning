                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 8:48 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with Crohn's disease and V-tach with
 palpitations.  PICC placement this morning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 9:42 a.m.:
 
 Tip of the PIC line is partially obscured by EKG lead, as it was earlier this
 morning, but then it could be seen that the wire stylet in the line ended at
 or just above the level of the superior cavoatrial junction.  Current study
 after removal of the wire shows the tip may be just beyond the superior
 cavoatrial junction now, at a level 7 cm below the carina.  I would withdraw
 it 2.5 cm to move it unequivocally into the low SVC.  Lungs are clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
