                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:32 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a fever.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging:
 
 Vascular congestion and mild edema worse in the right lung than the left. 
 There is also more opacification at the base of the right lung, but not a
 sufficient differential to suspect pneumonia.  Heart size is top normal. 
 Hyperinflation suggests small airway obstruction or emphysema.
