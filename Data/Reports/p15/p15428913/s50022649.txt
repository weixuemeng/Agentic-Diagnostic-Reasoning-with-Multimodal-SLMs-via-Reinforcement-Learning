 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  MR liver dated ___.  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previously visualized left pleural effusion has resolved.  Low lung
 volumes.  There is subtle opacification at the right lung base, which likely
 represents layering pleural fluid, as seen on the MR dated ___. 
 No focal consolidations.  No pulmonary edema.  Stable appearance of the

 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with subtle opacification at the right lung base, which
 likely represents layering pleural fluid as seen on the MR dated ___.  This can be clarified with a lateral chest radiograph.
 2. No focal consolidations to suggest pneumonia.
 3. Resolution of the previously visualized left pleural effusion.
