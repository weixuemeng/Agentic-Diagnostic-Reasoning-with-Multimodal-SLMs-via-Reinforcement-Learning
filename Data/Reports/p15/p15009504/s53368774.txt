 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable ___-___ disease, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the patient has been
 extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.  The lung volumes remain
 relatively low.  At the right lung bases, there is unchanged evidence of a
 parenchymal opacity with air bronchograms, obliterating the right heart
 border, and suspicious for a status post aspiration or pneumonia.  
 
 A pre-existing effusion and opacity on the left have almost completely
 resolved.  The size of the cardiac silhouette remains large, but there is no
 evidence for pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
