                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Vague opacity
 involves the anterior right costophrenic angle, but this is suspected to be
 most likely due to minor scarring or atelectasis perhaps associated with a
 small epicardial fat pad.  More generally the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity in the right costophrenic angle although more likely due to
 atelectasis than acute infection. Correlation with clinical presentation is
 suggested.
