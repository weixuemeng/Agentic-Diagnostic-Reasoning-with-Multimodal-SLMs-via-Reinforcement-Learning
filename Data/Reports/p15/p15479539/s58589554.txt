                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest was obtained with comparison to the
 examination from one day previously.  The endotracheal tube tip is
 approximately 7 cm above the carina, which seems high.  Suggest advancement of
 the tube by approximately 3 cm.
 
 Right-sided IJ central venous catheter is present, with the tip in the
 upper-to-mid SVC.  Left-sided IJ central venous catheter is present, with the
 tip in the region of the brachiocephalic vein.  A feeding tube remains
 present, extending into the abdomen, but with the distal tip not visualized.
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain enlarged but unchanged.  Again
 there are no focal pulmonary opacities, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax. 
 Slight increased opacity of the left hemithorax compared to the right
 persists.  This may represent some asymmetric pulmonary edema, or a
 superimposed component of atelectasis.  The possibility of an infection cannot
 be excluded.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Pleural effusion is
 difficult to evaluate on this supine radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube tip is 7 cm above the carina, which seems a bit high. 
 Suggest advancement of the catheter.  This was called by telephone to Dr. ___
 ___ at 12:10 pm, ___.
 
 2.  Slight increased opacity of left hemithorax compared to the right may
 represent asymmetry of pulmonary edema or slight pleural effusion, although
 superinfection or an infectious component cannot be excluded.
