  position.  Left PICC in mid-SVC. NG tube terminates in mid-esophagus -
  advancement to stomach recommended.  No other change from prior.  No

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with hypoxemic respiratory
 failure, intubated with new PICC line placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 6 cm above the carina.  The new hemodialysis
 catheter inserted through right internal jugular approach terminates at the
 level of low SVC but potentially right atrium, difficult to assess on the
 current study.  The NG tube passes below the diaphragm.  No pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.  Overall due to underpenetration, precise details are difficult
 to assess.
