                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ARDS.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the apical region has been
 excluded from the image.  Monitoring and support devices as visualized are
 essentially unchanged.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 hazy opacifications at the bases consistent with pleural effusions and
 compressive atelectasis, especially of the left lower lobe which shows
 substantial volume loss.  Pulmonary vascularity appears to be somewhat
 engorged, though the entire study is limited by extensive scattered radiation
 related to the size of the patient.
