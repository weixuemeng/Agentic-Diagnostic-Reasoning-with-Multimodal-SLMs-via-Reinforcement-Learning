                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation.  Trach placement of fluid status.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 Tracheostomy is in place.  Additional tubing is seen over the upper
 mediastinum, but cannot be traced beyond the level of the mid mediastinum -
 clinical correlation is requested.  A dual-lumen left-sided line is present,
 tip overlying the right atrium. A right IJ central line is present, tip not
 well delineated, but likely overlying the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.   
 
 Some patchy increased retrocardiac density is noted. Allowing for technique, 
 no CHF, frank consolidation, or gross effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Line overlying the mediastinum for which clinical correlation is
 requested.  The line cannot be traced beyond the mid mediastinum due to
 overlying soft tissues and underpenetration.
 
 2.  Atelectasis at left base.
