 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:15 PM
  Right IJ HD catheter, left PICC and trach in proper position.  Difficult to
  visualize the end of the NG tube, although extends below the diaphragm.  Low

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 19:30.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with dilated cardiomyopathy, sepsis and
 rhabdo on hemodialysis, now with one day of status post trach and post
 persistent fevers, evaluate consolidation and effusion.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 16:47.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film dated ___ at 19:30 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  A tracheostomy tube is in place with its tip approximately 4.5 cm above
 the carina.  There is a nasogastric tube which appears to course below the
 diaphragm but the tip is not identified on the current study.  A right
 internal jugular large-bore catheter remains in place with the tip in the
 distal SVC.  A left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the mid SVC.
 2.  Overall, lung volumes are low and there is crowding of pulmonary
 vasculature.  There has been interval improvement in the pulmonary edema, with
 residual mild interstitial edema.  There is stable cardiac enlargement
 consistent with known cardiomyopathy.  No pneumothorax.
