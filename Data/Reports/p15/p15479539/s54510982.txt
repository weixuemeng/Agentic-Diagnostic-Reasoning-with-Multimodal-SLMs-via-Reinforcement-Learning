  Right costophrenic angle not imaged. New blunting of the left costohrenic
  angle, which could be technical or due to a small pleural effusion. Low lung
  volumes with limiting evaluation. Retrocardiac density may represent
  atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ECG changes, concerning for right heart strain, assessment for
 new pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is new blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle, likely suggesting the presence of a small left
 pleural effusion.  The lung volumes continue to be low, there is a
 retrocardiac atelectasis but no evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or
 other acute parenchymal pathologic process.
