                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New onset tachypnea, sputum production, fevers, question interval
 change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VW
 
 For reasons that are unclear, the entire chest is not included on these
 images.  Rather, the exam is split between upper and lower images.  In
 addition, there is rotated positioning which likely accounts for subtle
 difference in opacity between the right and left lungs.  
 
 The right IJ line and left-sided catheter appear unchanged. Tracheostomy tube
 again noted.  The previously described line over the mediastinum is not
 appreciated on the current study. No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Allowing for technical limitations, no overt CHF, frank consolidation or
 effusion is identified.  The left hemidiaphragm is elevated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Limited exam, without gross change compared with earlier the same day. 
 Continued left base atelectasis.  If clinically indicated, repeat view can be
 obtained at no additional charge to the patient.
