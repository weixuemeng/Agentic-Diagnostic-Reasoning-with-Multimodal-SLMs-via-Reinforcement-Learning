                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia with intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal
 tube measures approximately 6.3 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is
 difficult to see, though it appears to extend into the stomach.  The side hole
 could be above the gastroesophageal junction.
 
 Scattered radiation related to the size of the patient greatly degrades the
 image.  Nevertheless, there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 congestive failure.
