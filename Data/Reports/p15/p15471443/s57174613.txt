 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Severe global pulmonary opacification has
 worsened considerably over 9 hr.  Transvenous right atrial and right
 ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses, unchanged, continuous
 from the left pectoral generator.  Bilateral pleural effusions are trace.

 Moderate pulmonary edema in the setting of only mild cardiomegaly raises the
 possibility that this is noncardiogenic edema.
