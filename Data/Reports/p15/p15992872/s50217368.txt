                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with OSH PICC placed  // verify PICC placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.  A linear density density seen in the soft tissues in
 the region of the left axilla and appears to extend up to the lateral border
 of the left chest wall.  Detail is considerably obscured due to overlying soft
 tissues, even on the edge-enhanced images.  No definite PICC line is seen
 within the thoracic cage and no PICC line is identified overlying the SVC.
 
 No obvious pneumothorax, though a small small pneumothorax could be obscured
 due to lordotic positioning.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is no CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 PICC line is not visualized over the SVC.  It is not clear that it extends
 beyond the left lateral chest wall.  Correlation with the previous outside
 films may help for further assessment.
 
 No acute pulmonary process identified.
