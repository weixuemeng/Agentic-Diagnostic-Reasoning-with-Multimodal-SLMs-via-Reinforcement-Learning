 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A venous catheter terminates in the superior vena cava.  There is a
 calcified right breast implant.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  The lungs appear clear. 
 Based on elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and blunting of the right
 costophrenic sulcus, there may be mild chronic scarring or a very small
 effusion, but there is no sizeable pleural effusion.  Mild degenerative
 changes are present along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
