                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known brain mass with increased confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST:  Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular
 crowding.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Right basilar atelectasis is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and
 hilar contours are normal allowing for lung volumes. A right Port-A-Cath tip
 projects over the right atrium. A calcified granuloma at the left lung apex is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia, edema, or effusion.
