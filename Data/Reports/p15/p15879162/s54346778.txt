                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates
 at the cavoatrial junction.  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is mild linear bibasilar
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural
 effusion. The patient is post left mastectomy.  No bony fractures are
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. No acute intrathoracic process.
 2. No fractures detected. This technique is not optimized for evaluation of
 osseous trauma; dedicated rib films with localizing markers can be obtained if
 there is a clinical concern for fracture.
