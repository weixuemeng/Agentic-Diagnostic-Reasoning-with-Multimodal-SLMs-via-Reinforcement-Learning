                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Progression of pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is a little overall
 change in the degree of bilateral pulmonary opacifications that is more
 prominent on the right.  Although some of this may reflect asymmetric
 pulmonary edema, a multifocal pneumonia is also present.  
 
 Subclavian PICC line is difficult to assess, though it appears to extend to
 the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.
