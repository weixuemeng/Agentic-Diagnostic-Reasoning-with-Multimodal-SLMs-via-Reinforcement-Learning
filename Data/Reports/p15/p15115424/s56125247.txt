                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with AMS. intubated in outside facility.  // confirm
 position of tubes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.1 cm above the carina.  The
 enteric tube loops in the distal esophagus before terminating near the GE
 junction.
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  There is likely a right pleural effusion. 
 There is left retrocardiac opacity, which may represent aspiration or
 atelectasis.  There is left lower lung atelectasis.  There are multiple
 gas-filled loops of bowel partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The endotracheal tube appears appropriately positioned.
 
 The enteric tube loops in the distal esophagus.  Recommend repositioning.
 
 Likely right pleural effusion and left retrocardiac opacity, which may
 represent aspiration and/or atelectasis.
