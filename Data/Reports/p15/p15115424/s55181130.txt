                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multifocal PNA  // any change in
 infiltrates
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15 11
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.  An ET tube is present, tip 3.4 cm above the carina.  An
 NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  Again seen is
 focally dense, somewhat patchy, opacity in the right lung base medially,
 essentially unchanged.  Mild patchy opacity at the left lung base is also
 similar to the prior film.  No CHF or gross effusion.  Relative lucency
 interposed between the right base opacity and right hemidiaphragm is again
 noted.  Doubt pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy relatively confluent opacities tear right-greater-than-left lung bases,
 consistent with pneumonic infiltrates.  Allowing for differences in
 positioning, the appearance is similar to 1 day earlier.
