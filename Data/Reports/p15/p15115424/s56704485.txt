                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman re-intubated  // any progression of
 infiltrates? ETT position?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, bilateral pleural
 effusions with associated bibasilar atelectasis have improved.  Consolidation
 in the right lower lobe, as well as retrocardiac opacity, persist and could
 represent multifocal infection or aspiration. There is mild central vascular
 congestion without overt pulmonary edema, unchanged.  No pneumothorax. 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.7 cm above the carina,
 unchanged.  Nasogastric tube extends below diaphragm and into the stomach,
 beyond the field-of-view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent right lower lobe consolidation and retrocardiac opacity, likely
 pneumonia or aspiration.  If cardiopulmonary status does not improve,
 recommend repeat chest CT, as this may represent extensive pneumonia with
 second concurrent diagnosis, such as vasculitis.
 2. Improved small bilateral pleural effusions with associated mild bibasilar
 atelectasis.
 3. Mild central vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
 4. Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.7 cm above the carina,
 unchanged.
