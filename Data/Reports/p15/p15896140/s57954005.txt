                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There are low lung volumes. 
 Within the right lung base adjacent to the heart border, there is a vague
 opacity that is new from prior study.  This may represent atelectasis or
 pneumonia, however this may also represent crowding of the pulmonary
 vasculature due to low lung volumes.  Likely small right pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.
 There is mild interstitial thickening and bronchial cuffing.  There is a small
 nodular opacity projecting over the right lower hemithorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Right lung base opacity may represent atelectasis or pneumonia, recommend
 clinical correlation.  This may also represent crowding of the vasculature due
 to low lung volumes.
 
 2.  Likely small right pleural effusion. Mild interstitial thickening and
 bronchial cuffing.
 
 3.  Small nodular opacity projecting over the right lower hemithorax. 
 Recommend shallow oblique views with nipple markers for better assessment. 
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 8:02am on ___ by
 phone.
