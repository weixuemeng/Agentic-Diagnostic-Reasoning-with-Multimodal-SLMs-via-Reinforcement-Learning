                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post CABG, evaluate for effusions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Re-identified is a right IJ central venous catheter with tip projecting over
 the high right atrium versus cavoatrial junction.  Also unchanged are multiple
 median sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips. There are very low
 lung volumes, likely accentuating the size of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, stable in size from prior exam.  The hila are not well assessed on
 this exam.  Retrocardiac opacity is persistent, with increased hazy
 opacification of most of the left lower lung, probably representing a
 combination of layering pleural fluid and atelectasis.  Left pleural fusion is
 likely mildly larger in comparison to prior exam, now all small to moderate. 
 Right moderate pleural effusion is also likely slightly larger, tracking along
 the right pleural space, with unchanged right basilar atelectasis.  There is
 no new superimposed focal lung consolidation.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Very low lung volumes.  Mildly increased bilateral small to moderate pleural
 effusions with adjacent bibasilar atelectasis.  No edema or definite new focal
 lung consolidation.
