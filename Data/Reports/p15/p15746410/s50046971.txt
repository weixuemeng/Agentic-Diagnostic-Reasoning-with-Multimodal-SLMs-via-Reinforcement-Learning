                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Hypoxia, follow up right lower lobe opacity, patient with
 COPD and new oxygen requirement.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  The right lower lobe opacity has increased, could
 be due to increasing atelectasis or pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  If any, there is a small right effusion.  Faint opacity in the
 left lower lobe is likely atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
