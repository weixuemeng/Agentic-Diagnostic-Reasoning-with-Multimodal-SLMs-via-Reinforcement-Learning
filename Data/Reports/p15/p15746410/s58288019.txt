                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with COPD exacerbation and shortness
 of breath, evaluate for possible acute infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No configurational
 abnormality is identified.  Normal appearance of thoracic aorta.  No
 mediastinal abnormalities are present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  No evidence of acute discrete local parenchymal infiltrates are
 present.  Similar as seen on several previous examinations, the patient now
 has increased interstitial markings on the bases and the diaphragms are
 relatively low positioned and somewhat flattened, all findings suggestive of
 COPD.  Acute infiltrates however cannot be identified and there is no evidence
 of pulmonary vascular congestion as the heart size is completely within normal
 limits.  On several previous portable single view chest examinations of
 ___ and ___, the patient had some episodes of scattered
 small parenchymal infiltrates on the lung bases, but this is not the case
 presently.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with COPD, but no signs of exacerbating
 infiltrates.
