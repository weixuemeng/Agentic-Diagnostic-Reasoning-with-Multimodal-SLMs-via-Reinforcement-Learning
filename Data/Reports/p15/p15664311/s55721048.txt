                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with left pleural mass status post bronchoscopy and
 pleural biopsy.  Now status post PleurX catheter placement.  Assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Lung volumes remain extremely low.  Left
 lower lobe opacity has increased, likely due to increasing pleural fluid;
 though the overall opacity likely reflects a combination of atelectasis, known
 pleural mass and pleural fluid.  A tiny left apical pneumothorax is stable. A
 left pleurX catheter terminates near the left hilum.  Subcutaneous emphysema
 along the left chest wall is decreased.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slightly increased left basilar opacity likely related to increasing
 pleural fluid.
 2.  Left PleurX catheter terminating near the left hilum.
 3.  Unchanged tiny left apical pneumothorax.
