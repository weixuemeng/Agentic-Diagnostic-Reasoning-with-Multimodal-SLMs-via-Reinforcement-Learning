 There is a 2-3 mm right apical pneumothorax.  No evidence of tension. 
 Post-surgical left lateral pleural thickening and small air inclusion in the
 left lateral soft tissues.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Minimal
 left basal atelectasis.  Minimal right pleural effusion.  Otherwise, the right
 hemithorax appears normal.
