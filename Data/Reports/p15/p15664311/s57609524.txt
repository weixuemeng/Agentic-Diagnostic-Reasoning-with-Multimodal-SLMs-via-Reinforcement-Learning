                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Left lower rib/chest pain.  Patient with history of
 metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, CT, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural and
 lung metastases are better seen in prior CT.  There are low lung volumes with
 persistent atelectasis in the right middle lobe and right lower lobe.  Small
 right effusion is unchanged.
 
 No displaced rib fractures or pneumothorax.  If clinically persistent concern,
 dedicated rib series could be performed.
