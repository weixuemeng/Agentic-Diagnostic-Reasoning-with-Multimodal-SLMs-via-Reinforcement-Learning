                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess pleural effusion.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Large left pleural effusion is grossly unchanged allowing the difference in
 positioning of the patient.  There are low lung volumes.  Bibasilar
 atelectases are larger on the left and unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable.  Previously described left pneumothorax is less conspicuous than
 before.  Patient has known left pleural mass.  There are increasing left
 perihilar atelectases.
