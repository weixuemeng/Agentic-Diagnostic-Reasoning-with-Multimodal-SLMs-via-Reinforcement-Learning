                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  C tube removal, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the left chest tube has been
 removed.  There is a small residual pneumothorax in the left apical region. 
 Opacification at the left base is consistent with some combination of
 atelectasis and effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 Opacification at the right base could reflect crowding of vessels or some
 atelectatic changes.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is again seen
 on this side.
