                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute sob  // eval for pleural effusion,
 edema      eval for pleural effusion, edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 14 57
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 23:26 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been interval development of a prominent interstitial pattern, more
 on the right than the left, as well as more focal patchy opacities in the
 right upper and lower lung and in the retrocardiac region. Given the interval
 change, this would favor mild pulmonary and interstitial edema rather than an
 infectious process.  There is possibly a small left effusion. Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable. A nasogastric tube is seen coiled within
 the stomach.  No pneumothorax.
