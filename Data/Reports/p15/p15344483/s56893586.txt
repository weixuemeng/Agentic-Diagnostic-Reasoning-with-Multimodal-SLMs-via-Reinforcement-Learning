                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, shortness of breath, question edema, atelectasis.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  LORDOTIC POSITIONING.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 21:57 p.m.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Again seen is an NG tube, with tip and side port
 overlying the gastric fundus.  Side port lies in the region of the GE
 junction, possibly slightly distal to it.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.  There is upper zone
 re-distribution, vascular plethora and increased interstitial markings
 consistent with interval development of CHF with interstitial edema.  At the
 left base, there is increasing opacity , with progressive left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.  Patchy opacity at the right base could also
 reflect the degree of collapse/consolidation.  Minimal blunting of both
 costophrenic angles, without gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening of CHF/interstitial edema, left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation and patchy opacity at right base.
