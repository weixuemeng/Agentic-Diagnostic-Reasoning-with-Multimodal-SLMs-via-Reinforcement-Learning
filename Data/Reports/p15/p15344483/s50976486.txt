 ?position of ET tube
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an
 endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 2 cm above the carina. It should
 be pulled back about 2 cm for proper positioning. This information was
 discussed with the resident on-call by the Radiology resident.
 Bibasilar opacification is again seen, consistent with pleural effusion
 bilaterally and substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Other
 monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
