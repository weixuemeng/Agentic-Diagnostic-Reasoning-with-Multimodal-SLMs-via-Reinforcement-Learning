                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  CHF and respiratory distress, status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ from 7:56 a.m., less than one hour
 prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  The
 patient has now been intubated with the endotracheal tube ending 3.4 cm above
 the carina.  An upper enteric tube ends in the stomach.  Moderate pulmonary
 edema and small right pleural effusion are unchanged from the prior study.  No
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. ETT in satisfactory position.
 2. Unchanged moderate pulmonary edema. Right lower lobe opacity may be due to
 edema. Recommend repeat radiograph after treatment to exclude underlying
 infection.
