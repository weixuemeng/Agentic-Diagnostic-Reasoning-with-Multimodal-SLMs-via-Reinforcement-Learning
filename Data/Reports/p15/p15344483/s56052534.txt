                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Abdominal CT ___, subsequent chest radiograph ___
 from 8:46 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Diffuse bilateral hazy opacities with perihilar fullness is
 compatible with moderate pulmonary edema, increased at the lung bases from the
 prior CT. Opacity at the right lower lobe may be due to edema, but underlying
 infection cannot be excluded.  There is probably a small right pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax. Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  A surgical clip projects over the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Moderate pulmonary edema, increased from prior CT.
 2. Right lower lobe opacity may be due to edema. Recommend repeat radiograph
 after treatment to exclude underlying infection.
