 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new central IJ  // pneumothorax? position 
 pneumothorax? position
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at 23:26
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable chest film dated ___ at 15 57 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central line
 which has its tip in the mid to distal SVC. No pneumothorax. The nasogastric
 tube is seen again coursing below the diaphragm with the tip coiled within the
 stomach.  There are persistent bibasilar patchy opacities with improved
 aeration in the right upper lung.  Findings would be consistent with
 fluctuating pulmonary edema rather than an infectious process.  Probable small
 layering bilateral effusions. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  A right shoulder replacement is incompletely visualized.
