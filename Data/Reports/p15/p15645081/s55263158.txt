                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p MVC with C7 burst fracture with 4mm retropulsion and 3mm
 parafalcine subdural hematoma s/p corpectomy (___).  // Intubated post op.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ from earlier today
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Partially evaluated cervical spinal hardware, new since the earlier
 radiograph.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic
 trachea.
 
 Low bilateral lung volumes.  Mild left basilar atelectasis.  No pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is enlarged but this
 may be technical secondary to AP technique and low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a cervical spinal hardware projecting over the mid
 thoracic inlet, incompletely evaluated.
 
 Low bilateral lung volumes.  Mild left basilar atelectasis.
