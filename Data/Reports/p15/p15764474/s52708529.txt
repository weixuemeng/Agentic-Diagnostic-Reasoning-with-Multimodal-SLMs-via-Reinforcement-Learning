                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Head trauma.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There are relatively low lung volumes which
 enhance the transverse diameter of the heart.  There is some indistinctness of
 pulmonary vessels that could reflect some increase in pulmonary venous
 pressure.  No definite pneumonia.  
 
 Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric
 tube extends to the upper stomach, where it crosses the lower margin of the
 image.
