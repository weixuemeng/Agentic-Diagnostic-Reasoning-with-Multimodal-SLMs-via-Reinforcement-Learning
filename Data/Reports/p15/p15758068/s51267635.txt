                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hematemesis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Streaky opacities in the
 lung bases likely reflect atelectasis though infection is not completely
 excluded.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities demonstrated. No subdiaphragmatic free air is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis.  Infection is not
 completely excluded.  No subdiaphragmatic free air.
