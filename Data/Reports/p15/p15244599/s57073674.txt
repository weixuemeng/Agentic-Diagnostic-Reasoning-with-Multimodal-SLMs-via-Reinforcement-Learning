                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis, encephalopathy,  s/p Dobhoff
 placement  // evaluate for dobhoff placement      evaluate for dobhoff
 placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the Dobhoff tube has been advanced
 slightly.  However, the opaque tip again straddles the esophagogastric
 junction.  The tube should be pushed forward at least 5-8 cm for optimal
 positioning.
 Right PICC line extends to the mid to lower SVC.  The left hemidiaphragm is
 not well seen on the current study, suggesting some layering effusion and
 volume loss in the left lower lobe.
