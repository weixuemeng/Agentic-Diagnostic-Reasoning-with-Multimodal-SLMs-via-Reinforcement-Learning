 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:20 PM
  Compared with the chest radiograph from ___, there has been
  interval placement of a Dobhoff feeding tube.  Sequential chest radiographs
  demonstrate advancement of the tube.  However, the weighted tip only barely
  passes the left hemidiaphragm, with the side-hole well above the
  gastroesophageal junction.  This should be advanced several cm to be
  positioned correctly within the stomach, if desired.  Increased bilateral lung
  opacities are also identified, which may reflect underlying vascular
  congestion.
  
  The above findings and recommendation were communicated via telephone by Dr.
  ___ to Dr. ___ at 19:18 on ___, ___ min after discovery.  Per
  Dr. ___, ___ patient has had prior Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and therefore,
  they have withdrawn the NG tube.

 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 2 EXAMS
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis, SBP s/p Dobhoff placement  //
 evaluate for dobhoff placement      evaluate for dobhoff placement
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS SINCE ___, MOST RECENTLY ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 2 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS SHOW REPOSITIONING OF THE ESOPHAGEAL FEEDING TUBE WITH THE
 WIRE STYLET IN PLACE FROM THE LOWER ESOPHAGUS TO THE GASTROESOPHAGEAL
 JUNCTION.  IT WOULD STILL NEED TO BE ADVANCED ABOUT 8 CM TO MOVE THE
 APPROPRIATELY INTO THE STOMACH.
 
 MOST SIGNIFICANT INTERVAL CHANGE IS NEW LEFT PERIHILAR OPACIFICATION WHICH
 COULD BE LARGE SCALE PNEUMONIA OR ASYMMETRIC PULMONARY EDEMA, PARTICULAR IF
 PATIENT LIES ON HER LEFT SIDE.  MILD CARDIOMEGALY IS ONLY A LITTLE LARGER
 TODAY THAN IT WAS ON ___.  MODERATE RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION IS LARGER. 
 THERE IS NO PNEUMOTHORAX.
