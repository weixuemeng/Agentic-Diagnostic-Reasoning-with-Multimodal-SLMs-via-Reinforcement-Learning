                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of shortness of breath and anasarca.  Evaluate for
 pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided. Lung volumes are
 low.  Perihilar interstitial opacities are consistent with mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema. Hazy opacity is present in the region of the left hilus which
 may represent developing pneumonia.  There are moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions.   There is no pneumothorax.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Dense
 material is noted in the left upper quadrant of uncertain etiology.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
 2. Possible early developing pneumonia in the left perihilar region. Short
 term follow-up radiograph is recommended.
