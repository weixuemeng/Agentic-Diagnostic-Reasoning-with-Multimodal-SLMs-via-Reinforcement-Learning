                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after right upper lobe
 wedge resection, evaluation for pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were compared to ___.
 
 Currently, the two upright PA and lateral upright chest radiographs
 demonstrate the presence of apical air collection that appears to be unchanged
 to minimally smaller than on the prior study.  On the other hand, there is
 interval increase in right pleural effusion, partially potentially loculated
 with right basal area of atelectasis.  Right mediastinal shift is unchanged
 and expected.  Left lung is clear.
