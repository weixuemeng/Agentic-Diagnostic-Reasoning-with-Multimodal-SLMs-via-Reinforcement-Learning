                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female presenting after cardiac arrest.  Evaluate
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  Please note that comparison to old studies can
 be helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating 2.3 cm above the carina.  Tip of
 the hemodialysis catheter terminates at the mid SVC.  An enteric tube extends
 to at least the low esophagus, but the tip is not captured on the current
 study.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No focal
 consolidation.  There is a small pleural effusion on the left.  No sizable
 pleural effusion on the right.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low-lying endotracheal tube, terminating 2.3 cm above the carina.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, with small left pleural effusion.
