                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest and chest radiograph, both dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pleural effusion, assess.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is a left
 pleural effusion again seen with a fluid level suggesting a hydropneumothorax.
 Please note, a similar finding was seen on prior CT, though the loculated gas
 component appears slightly increased from prior exam.  There is persistent
 left lower lobe consolidation, which could represent atelectasis or possibly
 pneumonia.  The right lung remains clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears grossly stable.  Bony structures are intact with a left humeral head
 replacement again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left hydropneumothorax, with gas component loculated and slightly
 increased from prior exam.  Left lower lobe consolidation could represent a
 combination of atelectasis and pneumonia, though clinical correlation is
 advised.
