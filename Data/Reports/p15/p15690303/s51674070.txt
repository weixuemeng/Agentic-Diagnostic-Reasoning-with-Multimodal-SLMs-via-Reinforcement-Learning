 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, status post pleurodesis, now Pleurx catheter,
 evaluation for recurrence of effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, one of the two left chest
 tubes has been removed.  One chest tube on the left remains in situ.  There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  A linear scar at the left lung apex, adjacent to
 a rib fracture with cortical defect, is unchanged.  The extent of pleural
 fluid on the left is decreased as compared to the previous image, but still
 clearly visible.  Moderate retrocardiac atelectasis.  Unchanged normal
 appearance of the right lung.
