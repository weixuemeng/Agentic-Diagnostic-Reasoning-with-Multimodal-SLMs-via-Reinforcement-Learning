                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with hypertension presenting with multiple injuries,
 mechanical fall downstairs, left humeral fracture.  Pneumothorax, chest tube
 removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 3.2 cm above the carina.  NG tube is in the stomach.  Left-sided
 chest tube has the side port in the chest wall.  Minimal residual apical left
 pneumothorax measures only 3 mm, unchanged.  Bilateral widespread opacities
 are partly explained by increase in moderate pulmonary edema.  There is
 bibasilar consolidation and probable pleural effusion.  The cardiac contour is
 mildly enlarged.  
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided chest tube has the side port outside of the thorax, but
 residual pneumothorax is minimal and unchanged.
 2.  Increase in moderate pulmonary edema.
 3.  Unchanged bibasilar atelectasis with pleural effusions.  
 
 The medical team have been contacted for the results.
