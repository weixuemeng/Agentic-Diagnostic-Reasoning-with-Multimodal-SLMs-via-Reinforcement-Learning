                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a history of rib fractures who presents
 for evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, CTA from ___,
 and chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is a round opacity in the left upper lobe which
 corresponds to the laceration seen on the prior CT.  This is unchanged
 compared to the prior exam.  The left third rib fracture is not clearly seen
 on this exam.  The previously noted right upper lobe nodules on the CT also
 cannot be clearly seen on this exam.  No new focal consolidations are
 identified in the lungs.  The mediastinal and hilar borders are unremarkable. 
 There appears to be interval increase in the left-sided pleural effusion;
 however, this may be secondary to differences in patient positioning compared
 to the prior exam.  There is stable moderate cardiomegaly.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. The comminuted lateral third rib left fracture well seen on prior CT is not
 seen clearly on this exam. If absolutely clinically necessary, would recommend
 CT for further evaluation.
 
 2. There appears to be an interval increase in the left-sided pleural
 effusion, however, the differences may be secondary to patient positioning
 technique.
