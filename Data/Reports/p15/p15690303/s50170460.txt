                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post pleuroscopy with persistent left hemothorax, here to
 evaluate for recurrent effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two left chest tubes are unchanged in position.  There is increased
 opacification of the left hemithorax likely reflecting increased left pleural
 effusion from ___ and unchanged atelectasis.  The inspiratory lung volumes
 are decreased from ___.  The right lung is relatively clear without
 significant pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is detected.  There is slightly
 increased pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiac silhouette is
 incompletely evaluated due to moderate left pleural effusion.  The mediastinal
 contours are unchanged with unfolding of the thoracic aorta and mild
 calcification of the aortic knob.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased moderate left pleural effusion from ___.
 2.  Unchanged position of two left chest tubes.
 3.  slightly increased pulmonary vascular congestion.
