 WET READ: ___ ___ 7:28 PM
  Evaluation is severely limited due to overlying subcutaneous air and
  projection. The ET Tube appears to be in the lower trachea at approximately 2
  cm from carina. There is a new left chest tube. Evaluation for pneumothorax is
  limited and a small pneumothorax may be present, but there is no increased
  rightward shift of the mediastinal structures. Pnemomediastinum persists.
  Otherwise, little change compared to prior study from the same day. Right
  hemidiaphragm's elevated appearance is likely projectional. Continued followup
  is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intubation, evaluation of endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.5 cm above the carina.
 The patient has also received a nasogastric tube.  The course of the tube is
 in correct position, the tip of the tube is not visible.  In the interval, a
 second left-sided chest tube has been inserted.  There are unchanged massive
 diffuse left and right soft tissue air collections.  Given the limitations of
 the overlying soft tissue changes, it is difficult to exclude the presence of
 a pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  Mild overinflation of the stomach.
