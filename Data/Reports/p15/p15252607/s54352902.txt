                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tricuspid endocarditis and septic
 arthritis  // per rehab (want a baseline)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  There are multiple cavitating lesions slightly obscured by
 superimposed interstitial edema and are better seen on prior radiographs and
 CT.  Interval increase in interstitial edema, however this can be exaggerated
 by low lung volumes.  Mild platelike atelectasis in the right mid lung.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The small right pleural
 effusion has increased in the interval.  The remaining pleural surfaces are
 normal.  The left PICC line terminates in the mid to lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval worsening of interstitial edema and small right pleural effusion. 
 Septic emboli better evaluated on prior imaging.
