                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.  There is no obvious lobar
 airspace consolidation.  Increased perihilar opacities and interstitial
 markings are consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  The heart size is
 minimally enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Although
 the patient is somewhat rotated, rightward deviation of the trachea is likely
 secondary to tortuous aorta.  Marked kyphosis of the spine is unchanged. 
 There is a stable moderate-large hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild decompensated congestive heart failure.
