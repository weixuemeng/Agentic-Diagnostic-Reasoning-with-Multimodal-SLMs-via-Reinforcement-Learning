                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with tongue SCC, status post extensive resection
 and free flap reconstruction with trach insitu.  Evaluate volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the
 mid-to-low SVC.  Feeding tube terminates above the GE junction and has been in
 similar position on prior radiographs.  The heart is top normal in size. 
 Hilar and mediastinal contours are stable.  Moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions remain unchanged.  There has been interval improvement of diffuse
 bilateral airspace opacities, likely reflective of improving pulmonary edema. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval improvement of diffuse bilateral airspace opacities, consistent
 with improving pulmonary edema. Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 
 2.  Feeding tube terminates above the GE junction, recommend advancing for
 standard positioning.
 
 These findings were discussed with ___ by ___ via
 telephone on ___ at 9:25 a.m., at the time of discovery.
