                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year old man status post radical neck dissection with free
 flap to tongue, trach, with desaturation to ___%.  Study requested to rule out
 infiltrate, atelectasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has
 been gradual improvement of a right upper lobe consolidation.  In general,
 vascular congestion also appears improved, although there is some prominence
 of the azygos vein. No new focal consolidations are identified. Enteric tube
 is again seen straddling the GE junction, advancement of the tube is
 recommended. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Interval improvement of right upper lobe consolidation, which could be
 related to aspiration or volume loss. Given the prominence of the azygous vein
 this could also be a manifestation of right heart failure although vascular
 congestion appears improved in general. 
 
 2. Enteric tube straddles GE junction, recommend advancing for more stable
 positioning. 
 
 These findings were communicated to ___ NP by Dr. ___ via
 telephone on ___ at 7:20 PM.
