                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with recent neck surgery, fevers to 102,
 evaluate for possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar study ___ ___.  High positioned diaphragms indicate
 poor inspirational effort and result in crowded appearance of pulmonary
 vasculature.  In comparison with a preceding similar study ___ ___, there
 is no evidence of newly-developed discrete local pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrates that can be identified as pneumonia.  Observe that the portable
 examination in supine position has limitations in evaluating the entire lung.
 
 It is observed that the Dobbhoff line remains in unchanged position,
 apparently hung up in the pylorus as it does not progress into the stomach.
