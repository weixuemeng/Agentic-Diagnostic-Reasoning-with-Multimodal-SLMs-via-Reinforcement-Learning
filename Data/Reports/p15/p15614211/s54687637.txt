 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-erect view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. 
 Moderately large bilateral pleural effusions have progressed since prior. 
 Diffuse airspace opacities have also progressed.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are difficult to discern due to adjacent opacities.  Dobhoff tube
 is unchanged in position and is stationed at the level of the pylorus.

 In comparison with ___ exam, there is interval progression of moderately
 large bilateral pleural effusions and diffuse bilateral opacities, which
