                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post hemiglossectomy, radical neck
 dissection, radial forearm free flap, now with Dobbhoff in place.  Study
 requested for assessment of Dobbhoff tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  An enteric tube is seen straddling the GE junction.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing for accentuation
 by low lung volumes.  There is partial atelectasis and increased opacity of
 the right upper lobe, which could be related to aspiration. There is elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm. Increased opacity is also noted at the left lower
 lung, and could reflect atelectatic changes or early pneumonia.  There is no
 definite pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Enteric tube straddles GE junction, recommend advancing for more stable
 positioning. 
 
 2. Increased opacity at right upper lobe with partial atelectasis. In the
 appropriate clinical setting, this finding could represent aspiration.
