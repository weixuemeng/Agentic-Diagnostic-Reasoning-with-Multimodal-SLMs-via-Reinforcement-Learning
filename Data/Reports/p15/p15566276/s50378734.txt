                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG on ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate multiple sternotomy wires. 
 Again seen is a widened mediastinum, which is improved compared to prior
 radiograph, presumably secondary to slowly resolving hematoma.  A small left
 pleural effusion is also improved.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The lung
 fields appear clear.  No pneumothorax or bony abnormality is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. A widened, postoperative mediastinum is improving over the past week,
 presumably secondary to slowly resolving hematoma.
 
 2.  Small left pleural effusion, decreased over the past week.
