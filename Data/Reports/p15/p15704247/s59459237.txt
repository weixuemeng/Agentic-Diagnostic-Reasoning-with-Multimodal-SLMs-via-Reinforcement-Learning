                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever  // r/o infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Lung volumes are low. Overlying leads
 limits of best evaluation. Linear densities in lower lungs most compatible
 with atelectasis and bronchovascular crowding. Furthermore, subtle
 ground-glass opacity in the right lung base raises concern for an early
 pneumonia, possibly with a small right pleural effusion. Heart size appears
 mildly enlarged. The aorta is unfolded. An anchor at the right humeral head
 noted. Bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Subtle opacity in the right lung base is concerning for an early pneumonia
 in the correct clinical setting.
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis.
 3. Top-normal heart size.
