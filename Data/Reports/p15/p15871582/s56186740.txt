                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, lethargy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob are again demonstrated. 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is similar compared to the previous study
 with a small to moderate right pleural effusion and trace left pleural
 effusion, relatively unchanged compared to the previous studies.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate on the right and trace on the
 left, with bibasilar atelectasis and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
