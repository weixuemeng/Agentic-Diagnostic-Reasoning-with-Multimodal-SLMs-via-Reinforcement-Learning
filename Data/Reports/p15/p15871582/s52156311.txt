                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea and history of CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and ventricle.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is re- demonstrated, a component which may reflect a pericardial
 effusion.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  There is a continued moderate right pleural
 effusion, with trace left pleural effusion, not substantially changed in the
 interval.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Mild atelectasis is noted in lung bases. 
 There are mild degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine with slight
 loss of height of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, not changed from the
 previous studies, a component which may reflect a moderate size pericardial
 effusion as seen on the previous CT.
 2. Moderate right and small left bilateral pleural effusions, similar to the
 previous exams.
