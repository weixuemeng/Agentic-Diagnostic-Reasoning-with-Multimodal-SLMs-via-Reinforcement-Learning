                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old with wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are hyperinflated
 with flattening of the diaphragms.  There is increased hazy opacity throughout
 both lungs with indistinct pulmonary vascular markings.  There is a
 superimposed more confluent consolidation in the left mid lung laterally.  The
 cardiac silhouette has enlarged since prior.  Blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angles is suggestive of small effusions.  Atherosclerotic
 calcification is noted at the aortic arch.  Left chest wall dual-lead pacing
 device seen with lead tips in the right ventricular apex and right atrium.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion and small
 effusions with cardiomegaly.  More confluent region of opacity in the left
 upper lobe, potentially superimposed infection.
