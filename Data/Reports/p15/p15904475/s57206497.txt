                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia after D&C three days previously.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Study is limited due to patient
 rotation.  The heart size is likely moderate to severely enlarged.  Evaluation
 of the mediastinal contour is limited due to the rotation.  There appears to
 be mild pulmonary edema, which appears new when compared to the prior study. 
 No definite focal consolidations seen, though the extreme left costophrenic
 angle is excluded from the field of view.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:   Limited study due to patient rotation. Mild pulmonary edema.
