                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.   
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared to the ___ radiograph, there is new opacity in the left mid zone,
 likely in the left upper zone anteriorly, with minimal stranding at the left
 base and with left greater than right pleural fluid and/or thickening
 posteriorly.  There is also some pleural fluid and/or thickening along the
 lowermost left chest wall. Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base.-
 Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear, without focal consolidation or CHF. 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The aorta is calcified.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise within normal limits. 
 Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Focal left upper lobe opacity, which is new compared with ___.
 The differential certainly includes an acute pneumonic infiltrate.  However,
 followup PA and lateral chest x-rays after resolution of acute symptoms is
 strongly recommended to exclude the possibility of an underlying chronic
 opacity.
 
 2) Pleural fluid and/or thickening at left greater than right bases, may also
 be new.
