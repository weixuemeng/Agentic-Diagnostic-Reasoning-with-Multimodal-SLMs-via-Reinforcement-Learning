                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph images are available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 patchy left basilar opacity which could be due to atelectasis, but underlying
 consolidation due to pneumonia is not excluded.  The finding is not well seen
 on the lateral view.  There is minimal vascular congestion.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar opacity best seen on the frontal view, could
 represent atelectasis versus consolidation due to focus of pneumonia.
