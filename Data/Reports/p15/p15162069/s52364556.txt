                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with multiple myeloma, being worked up
 for autologous bone marrow transplant, eligibility testing.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is now within normal
 limits.  No configurational abnormalities are seen.  Thoracic aorta is mildly
 widened and elongated but no local contour abnormalities or walled
 calcifications are identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. 
 There is no evidence of any acute or chronic pulmonary parenchymal abnormality
 and the pleural sinuses are free laterally and posteriorly.  No pneumothorax
 in the apical area.  Skeletal structure of the thorax grossly unremarkable. 
 When comparison is made with the next previous examination, it can be stated
 at that time moderate cardiac enlargement existed in the presence of some
 interstitial edema on the lung bases but absence of pleural effusions.  All
 these findings have now been normalized and confirm the previously made
 diagnosis of mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion at the time of
 previous examination of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: No significant cardiovascular or pulmonary abnormalities
 identified.
