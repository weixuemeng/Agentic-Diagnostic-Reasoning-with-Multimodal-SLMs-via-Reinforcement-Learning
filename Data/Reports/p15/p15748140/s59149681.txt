  Right lower lobe pneumonia.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with SOB for 7 days, can't take a deep breath, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rounded opacity at the right lung base does not silhouette out the diaphragm
 and corresponds to the right lower lobe on the lateral projection, most likely
 a right lower lobe pneumonia.  Given the position, pulmonary infarction should
 be considered as well, and clinical correlation is advised.  There is a
 suggestion there may be a similar smaller area at the left lung base.
 
 There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Rounded opacity at the right lung base is most likely a right lower lobe
 pneumonia.  Given peripheral location, consideration should be given to
 pulmonary infarction as well.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. 
 ___ On the telephone on ___ at 3:44 PM, 5 minutes after
 the discovery of the findings.
