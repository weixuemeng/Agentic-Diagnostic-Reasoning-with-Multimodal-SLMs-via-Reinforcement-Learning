 retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis, with no evidence for focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal patchy retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis in the setting
 of low lung volumes.
