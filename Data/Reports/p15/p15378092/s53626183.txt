                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with lymphoma, increased bands with
 concern for infection.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 portable AP chest examination of ___.  Again on the frontal PA view,
 the patient makes a very poor inspirational effort resulting in relatively
 high-positioned diaphragms and thereto related crowded appearance of the
 pulmonary basal vasculature.  There is no conclusive evidence for any new
 parenchymal infiltrate and the lateral pleural sinuses are free.  Previously
 described right-sided Port-A-Cath system advanced via internal jugular
 approach remains in unchanged position and terminates at the level of the
 carina overlying the right-sided mediastinal structures.  On the lateral view,
 the patient makes a very inspirational effort with normally positioned
 diaphragms and resolution of the crowded appearance of the pulmonary
 vasculature on the frontal view.  The lateral view demonstrates normal
 vasculature, absence of any atelectatic structures or pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrates with the posterior pleural sinuses clearly free from any fluid
 accumulation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute infiltrates or pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax in apical area in this patient with lymphoma and increased bands
 raise concern for infections.
