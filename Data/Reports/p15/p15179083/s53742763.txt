                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with possible torsades, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single AP upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates
 asymmetric pulmonary edema greater on the right than the left.  There is
 slightly increased opacification of the left lung base which obscures the left
 hemidiaphragm compared to the prior study and may represent a small left
 pleural effusion or atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable and within
 normal limits.  Biliary drains are in place in the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.  A device is also located in the abdomen, which may be external to
 the patient or alternatively may represent a nerve stimulator.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Increased opacity in the left lung base
 likely represents pleural effusion with atelectasis, but underlying
 consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Stable cardiomegaly.
