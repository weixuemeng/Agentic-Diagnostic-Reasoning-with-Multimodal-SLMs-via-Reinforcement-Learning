                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with fever, please assess for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest CT and radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Redemonstration of a larger retrocardiac opacification,
 characterized as a large diaphragmatic hernia on the ___ CT. 
 Adjacent opacification likely reflects atelectasis, though cannot exclude
 infectious process in the appropriate clinical setting.  Left costophrenic
 angle is blunted, reflecting atelectasis or a small pleural effusion.  Linear
 right middle lobe opacification is similar to prior radiograph and correlated
 with area of atelectasis on concurrent CT.  Stable mild enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No
 lytic or blastic lesion identified.  There is stable mild vertebral body
 height loss of mid thoracic vertebrae, unchanged compared to ___ CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large retrocardiac opacity likely represents combination of large
 hiatal hernia and adjacent atelectasis, though cannot exclude infectious
 process in the correct clinical setting.  Possible left pleural effusion.
 Stable mild mid thoracic vertebral body height loss.
