                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with supraventricular tachycardia and shortness
 of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___, and concurrent
 chest CT from ___.  
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A large retrocardiac opacity with an
 air-fluid level is seen on multiple prior examinations and is consistent with
 a known large hiatal hernia.  Slightly increased left lower lobe consolidation
 and linear right middle lobe opacity, correspond with areas of atelectatic
 collapse seen on concurrent CT.  There is no pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema
 or pleural effusions are evident.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged from
 prior.  A healed though persistently deformed left humeral head fracture is
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Increased opacification of both lung bases corresponding to areas of
 atelectatic collapse seen on concurrent chest CT, please see report for
 details.
 
 2.  Large hiatal hernia
