                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  Heart size remains moderately enlarged with a
 left ventricular predominance.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation, although assessment of the lung apices is somewhat
 obscured by the patient's chin and neck projecting over these areas.  No
 pleural effusion or large pneumothorax is identified.  There are moderate
 multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
