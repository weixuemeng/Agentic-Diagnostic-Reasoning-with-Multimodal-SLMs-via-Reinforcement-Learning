                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Generalized weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 increased opacity along the right mid-to-lower lateral hemithorax, which may
 relate to prior trauma/rib fractures, possible pleural thickening.  The
 patient is rotated in position.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mild-to-moderately enlarged.  No overt pulmonary edema
 is seen.  A punctate radiopaque structure projecting over the soft tissue just
 adjacent to the lateral humeral head may relate to calcific tendinosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pleural thickening along the mid-to-lower lateral right
 hemithorax could relate to prior trauma.  Correlate with history of prior
 trauma/prior.  Consider repeat chest radiograph with the patient in better
 position.  No definite focal consolidation.
