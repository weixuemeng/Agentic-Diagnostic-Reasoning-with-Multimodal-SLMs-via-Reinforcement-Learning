                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Renal failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT abdomen and pelvis ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated.  Aside from minimal atelectasis in the lung bases, there is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No pulmonary vascular
 engorgement is present.  Linear densities within the right upper quadrant of
 the abdomen are compatible with a fractured old inferior vena cava filter, as
 demonstrated on the prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
