                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ILD, COPD, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing right upper
 lobe opacity has completely cleared.  There is unchanged moderate cardiomegaly
 with enlargement of the left heart contour.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta.  Asymmetry of the rib cage, obviously caused by scoliosis.  The frontal
 radiograph shows no other abnormalities.  On the lateral radiograph, there is
 a sound of minimally increased opacity at the lung bases.  The shape of this
 change is more suggestive of atelectasis than of pneumonia.  
 
 Normal appearance of the hilar and mediastinal structures.  No pleural
 effusions.
