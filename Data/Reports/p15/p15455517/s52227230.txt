                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoglycemia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A central venous catheter has been removed.  The heart is again
 moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A
 nodular opacity suggesting a nipple shadow projects over the left mid lung. 
 Upper zone re-distribution of pulmonary vascularity appears similar, but
 otherwise the lungs appear clear.  Extreme posterior costophrenic sulci are
 excluded, but there is no evidence for pleural effusions.  The bony structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Baseline cephalization of pulmonary vascularity and cardiomegaly but no
 evidence for superimposed acute disease.  
 
 2.  Suspected nipple shadow projecting over the left mid lung.  However, for
 confirmation, a repeat PA view with the nipple markers is recommended when
 clinically appropriate.
 
 Recommendation for a follow-up chest PA view with nipple markers was discussed
 with Dr. ___ on ___ by telephone.
