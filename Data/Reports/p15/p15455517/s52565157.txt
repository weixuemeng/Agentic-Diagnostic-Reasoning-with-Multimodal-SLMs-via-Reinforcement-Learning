                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and fever
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CTA of the chest from

 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lungs are clear.  No confluent
 consolidation is identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  Enlargement of the
 hilar and upper lobe vasculature is longstanding and unchanged from prior
 examination.  There is no overt interstitial pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal
 contours appear within normal limits.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 is similar to prior examination, though is moderate-to-severe.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Chronic engorgement of the hilar vasculature, though no acute pulmonary
 edema
 2.  No confluent consolidation to suggest pneumonia
 3.  Unchanged moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly
