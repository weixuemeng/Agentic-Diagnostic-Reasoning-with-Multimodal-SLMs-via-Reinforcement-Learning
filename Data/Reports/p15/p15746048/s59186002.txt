                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with R PICC malpositioned, evaluate
 repositioning.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right approach PICC has been repositioned, now terminating in the low SVC.
 Low lung volumes cause left basilar atelectasis.  A small to moderate left
 pleural effusion is unchanged from the prior study.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and
 terminates within the stomach.  The endotracheal tube terminates 4.5 cm from
 the carina.  The previously seen right subclavian line has been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval repositioning of the right approach PICC, which terminates in the
 low SVC.
 2. Unchanged small to moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent
 atelectasis.
