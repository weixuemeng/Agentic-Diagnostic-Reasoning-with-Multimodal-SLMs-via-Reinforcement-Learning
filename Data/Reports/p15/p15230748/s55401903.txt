                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of multiple sclerosis now
 status post chemotherapy and cough.  Evaluate for new infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  The heart size remains within normal limits.  Thoracic
 aorta unremarkable.  No new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are identified. 
 Similar as on the preceding examination one can identify an old rib fracture
 with callus formation in the right hemithorax located in the anterolateral
 portion of the fifth rib.  Comparison demonstrates that there is a local
 pleural thickening along the right lateral chest wall involving either the
 fifth rib more proximally or perhaps the fourth rib.  These changes are not
 surprising in this patient with history of multiple myeloma and may represent
 rib abnormalities related to this condition.  Otherwise, no gross skeletal
 abnormalities are identified short of some degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine but no evidence of vertebral body compression.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of cardiac enlargement, pulmonary congestion or new
 acute pulmonary infiltrates in this patient with history of multiple myeloma.
