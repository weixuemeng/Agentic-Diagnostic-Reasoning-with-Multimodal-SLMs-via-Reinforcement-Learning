                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  History of myeloma and COPD with progressive cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is persistent
 vague opacity in the lingula but this seems to be a background finding of long
 chronicity that may indicate minor atelectasis or scarring. The chest is
 hyperinflated. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Waxing and waning minor lingular opacity suggesting atelectasis or scarring;
 pneumonia seems less likely to explain this appearance.
