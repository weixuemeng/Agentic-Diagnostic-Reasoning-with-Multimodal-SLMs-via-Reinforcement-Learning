                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.  Question
 consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Left chest wall port
 is seen with catheter tip projecting over the RA SVC junction.  There is an
 irregular mass centered in the left mid lung in the perihilar region.  Nodular
 opacity projecting over the right upper lung as well.  There are irregular
 regions of opacity in the left upper lung peripherally as well.  Elsewhere,
 the lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Surgical clips seen in the right axilla. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.  Surgical clips seen in
 the right upper quadrant, suggestive of cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Irregular mass in the left perihilar region, suspicious for
 malignancy.  Additional nodular opacities projecting over the upper lungs
 bilaterally.  Correlation with outside films would be of use to further
 characterize.  No evidence of other focal consolidation.  Surgical clips in
 the right axilla.
