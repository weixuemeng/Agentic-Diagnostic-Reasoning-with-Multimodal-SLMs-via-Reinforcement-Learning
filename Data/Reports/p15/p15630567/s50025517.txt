                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, pneumothorax.  Evaluate chest tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Left-sided chest tube is noted with tip projecting over
 the left upper lung field.  Small amount of  subcutaneous emphysema is
 demonstrated within the left lateral chest wall.  No pneumothorax is clearly
 visible on this exam.  Heart size is accentuated due to low lung volumes, but
 likely mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted.  Small left pleural
 effusion is demonstrated.  Bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced in
 the retrocardiac region, may reflect atelectasis though infection is not
 excluded.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No definite pneumothorax seen on this single semi upright AP view.  Left
 chest tube in place with a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema in the left
 lateral chest wall.
 
 2. Low lung volumes with bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis, but
 infection is difficult to exclude.  Small left pleural effusion.
