                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Permanent pacemaker remains in place with leads overlying the
 expected locations of the right atrium and right ventricle.  A small
 radiolucency is observed at the junction of the right ventricular lead and
 electrode; this is difficult to assess on this portable projection with
 overlapping soft tissue structures of the chest and abdomen.  Considering
 provided history of right ventricular perforation, the possibility of lead
 fracture should be considered as communicated by phone to Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 9:45 a.m. at the time of discovery.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable in appearance, and lungs are clear except for linear
 atelectasis in both lower lungs.
