                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The recently described radiolucency at the junction of the right
 ventricular lead and electrode is no longer evident on the current study,
 which provides better visualization of this region than the prior portable
 radiograph.  The atrial and ventricular leads are in expected location, and
 there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The heart demonstrates left ventricular
 configuration, and the aorta is tortuous.  Lungs are clear except for a
 calcified granuloma in the right mid lung region and minor atelectasis at the
 extreme bases posteriorly.  Questionable small pleural effusions are also
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right atrial and ventricular leads as described, with no evidence
 of pneumothorax.
