                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of recurrent bronchitis and
 increased sputum production, here to evaluate for bronchiectasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show stable biapical
 pleural thickening.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is unchanged from
 the preceding radiograph and likely represents pleural scarring.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No pulmonary vascular congestion or edema is present.  There
 are no findings to suggest bronchiectasis by radiography at this time.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No findings to suggest bronchiectasis by radiography at this
 time.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
