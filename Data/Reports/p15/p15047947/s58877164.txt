                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness  // r/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated. Minor basilar atelectasis is seen without focal
 consolidation. Minimal blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle may
 be due to slight pleural thickening of the trace effusion is not excluded.
 There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight blunting of the left posterior costophrenic angle could be due to
 pleural thickening versus a very trace pleural effusion. Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
