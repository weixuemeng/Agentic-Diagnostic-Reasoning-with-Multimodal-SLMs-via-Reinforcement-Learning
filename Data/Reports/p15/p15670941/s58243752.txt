                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Heart block status post pacemaker insertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  There
 has been interval placement of a left pectorally implanted pacemaker with a
 single lead terminating in the right ventricle without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The previously appreciated nodular opacity along the left heart
 border is not clearly visualized on either views of today's study as the
 patient is turned and the nodule is obscured by the cardiac silhouette.  Lungs
 are otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left pectoral pacer in appropriate position with lead in the right
 ventricle without evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Previously appreciated nodule on the left heart border is not clearly
 visualized on today's study.  Further evaluation with dedicated chest CT is
 recommended.
 
 Results were entered into the ___ online critical result database.
