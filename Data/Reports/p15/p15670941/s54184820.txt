  No evidence of acute disease.  Nodular focus along inferior margin of left
  hilum, artifact versus nodule; recommend short-term follow-up with PA and
  lateral views to see whether it may persist when clinically appropriate.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Heart block.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from CT torso dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  A discrete nodular focus projects inferior to the left
 hilum near the left cardiac border.  It may represent a normal vascular
 structure but at least raises some concern for a nodule.  When clinically
 appropriate, repeat views with standard PA and lateral technique are
 recommended to assess further.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Possible left
 infrahilar nodule versus a normal vascular structure.  When clinically
 appropriate, repeat PA and lateral radiographs are recommended to assess
 further.  A preliminary report regarding the findings and recommendations was
 posted to the ER department dashboard while the patient was still in the
 emergency room.
