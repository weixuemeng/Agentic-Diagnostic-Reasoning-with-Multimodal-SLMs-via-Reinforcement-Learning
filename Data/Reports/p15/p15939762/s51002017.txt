 INDICATION:  Postoperative after thoracic spinal fusion.  Fever, new oxygen
 requirement.  Concern for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates cervical and thoracic
 spinal fusion hardware and surgical ___ overlying the mediastinum.  There
 are low lung volumes and dependent atelectasis, greater on the right. An
 underlying effusion or focal consolidation cannot be excluded.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged, likely related to recent
 surgery.  There is no pneumothorax.
