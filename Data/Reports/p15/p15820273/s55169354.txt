                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 there may be minimal interstitial edema.  No focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  No displaced fracture is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given
 this, possible minimal interstitial edema.  No focal consolidation.
