 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of diverticulitis, nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital film from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change, with the exception of a nasogastric tube that has been newly inserted.
 The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not included on
 the film, but is likely in the prepyloric zones of the stomach.  No
 complications, notably no pneumothorax.
