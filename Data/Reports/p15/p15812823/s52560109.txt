                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ h/o L SFA stenosis   chronic ___   ___ toe gangrene p/w
 increased swelling/drainage from wounds  // Pre-op Surg: ___ (LLE angio)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is probable background COPD.  Heart size at the upper limits of normal
 or slightly enlarged.  Aorta is mildly unfolded and calcified.  Increased
 interstitial markings are seen diffusely in both lungs, but with a relatively
 patchy distribution.  This is similar to radiographs from ___ can
 ___ and is compatible with previously described chronic
 interstitial lung changes.  No focal consolidation or gross effusion is
 identified.  Allowing for the background interstitial changes, no definite
 CHF.  Metallic density in the upper abdomen most likely represents a vascular
 stent.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable background COPD, with chronic interstitial changes in the lungs.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude a pneumonic
 infiltrate or atypical distribution of CHF, but given similarity to prior
 films,  appearances on today's chest x-ray are likely accounted for by chronic
 changes.  Doubt acute superimposed pulmonary process.
