                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Congestive heart failure presenting with saturations in the 70s.
 Assess for acute process, fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes with
 chronic interstitial fibrosis and bibasilar atelectasis. Cephalization with a
 increased interstitial markings in the upper lobes is most consistent with
 mild vascular congestion. A focal opacity within the left lingula is more
 prominent on today's examination. No pleural effusion. Heart size, mediastinal
 contour, and hila are unremarkable. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Increased opacity in the lingula is most consistent with atelectasis
 however differential pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2. Mild vascular congestion.
 3. Evidence of chronic interstitial fibrosis and bibasilar atelectasis.
