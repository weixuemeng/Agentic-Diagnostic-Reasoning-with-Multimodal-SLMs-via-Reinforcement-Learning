                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with increasing  shortness of breath// Assess for
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CT torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Coarse interstitial opacities are noted diffusely within
 the lungs, most pronounced along the periphery and right mid lung field,
 compatible with a chronic interstitial lung disease. Patchy opacities in the
 lung bases likely reflect superimposed atelectasis. No focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is seen. No definite pleural effusion is identified. There is no
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis superimposed on
 a background of chronic interstitial lung disease. Infection is difficult to
 exclude however.
