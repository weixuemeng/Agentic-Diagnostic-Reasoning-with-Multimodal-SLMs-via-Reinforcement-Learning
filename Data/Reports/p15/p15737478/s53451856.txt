                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and CT chest and chest x-ray
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs compatible with
 patient's underlying emphysema.  There is no superimposed consolidation. 
 Blunting of the left lateral costophrenic angle could be due to atelectasis
 although small effusion is possible.  Cardiac silhouette is moderately
 enlarged and atherosclerotic calcifications are seen at the arch.  Known
 hiatal hernia is seen in the retrocardiac region.  No displaced fractures
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings likely due to patient's known COPD.  Blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle could be due to atelectasis although small
 effusion is possible
