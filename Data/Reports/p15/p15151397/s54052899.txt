                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // eval cariomegaly
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is not enlarged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits. Slight haziness over the right heart border is likely artifact due to
 mild pectus excavatum configuration. No CHF, focal infiltrate, effusion, or
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 There is suggestion of slight left convex curvature of the thoracic spine
 centered at the approximate T5 level. On the lateral view, visualized
 vertebral body heights and vertebral body alignment is preserved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Heart size normal. No acute pulmonary process identified.
 2. Note made of mild pectus excavatum and slight left convex curvature of the
 thoracic spine.
