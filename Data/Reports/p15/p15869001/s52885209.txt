                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain after fall.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  The lungs are clear
 of focal consolidation or effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged.  Hypertrophic change is seen in the spine.  Osseous
 and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Enlarged
 cardiac silhouette, potentially due to either cardiomegaly; however,
 possibility of pericardial effusion is not excluded.  Clinical correlation
 suggested.
