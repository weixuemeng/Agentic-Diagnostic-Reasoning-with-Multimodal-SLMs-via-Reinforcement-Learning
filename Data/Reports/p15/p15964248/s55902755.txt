                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  r/o pna vs pulmonary
 History: ___M with lethary // r/o pna vs pulmonary
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest radiograph, frontal view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is dense opacity in the left lung base which could be due to combination
 of large left pleural effusion and left lower lobe volume loss.  Superimposed
 pneumonia is also possible.  Cardiac silhouette is obscured by large left
 pleural effusion, however probably moderately enlarged.  Faint opacity at the
 right lung base is likely atelectasis.  Left pectoral pacemaker with 2 leads
 terminating in right ventricle and right atrium are in unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Dense opacity in the left lung base could be due to left lower lobe volume
 loss and large left pleural effusion.  Superimposed pneumonia is also
 possible.
