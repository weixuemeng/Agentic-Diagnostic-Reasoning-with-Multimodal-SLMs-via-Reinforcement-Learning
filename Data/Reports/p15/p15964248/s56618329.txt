  Interval placement of a catheter projecting over the heart.  This may be
  related to patient's reported pericardial effusion.  Dense consolidation in
  the left lower hemi thorax may be related to this effusion, and/or a
  combination of pleural fluid and left lower lobe volume loss.  Right base
  opacity is unchanged.
