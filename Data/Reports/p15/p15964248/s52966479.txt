                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lytic C2 lesion, smoking history  // Please
 assess for malignancy/metastatic disease
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Please note that a portable chest radiograph has relatively low sensitivity
 for detecting pulmonary nodule.  With this limitation in mind, no dominant
 mass is evident within the lungs, but CT would be much more sensitive for
 detecting pulmonary metastases or primary lung cancer. Heart is upper limits
 of normal in size, with indwelling dual lead pacemaker. Small left pleural
 effusion is present with adjacent atelectasis and or consolidation. A mass are
 nodule in this region cannot be excluded.
