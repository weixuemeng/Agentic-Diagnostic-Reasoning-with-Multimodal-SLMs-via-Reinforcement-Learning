                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post open right colectomy with
 extensive lysis of adhesions for right cecal mass, now with nausea and
 vomiting around NG tube, check for placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___.  Mild degree of cardiomegaly
 as before, but no evidence of new pulmonary congestion or pleural effusions. 
 The presence of an NG tube is now seen and it can be followed through the
 stomach pointing towards the duodenum.  There exists a linear density on the
 right base, which was not present on the previous examination.  This finding
 is compatible with some aspiration, which may be related to the position of
 the NG tube as indicated in the requisition.  There is, however, no evidence
 of any large discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates and the lateral
 pleural sinuses remain free from any fluid accumulation.  No pneumothorax is
 identified in the apical area.  An orthopedic stabilization plate in the lower
 neck area is seen and remains unchanged in position in comparison with the
 previous study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Plate atelectasis on right right lung base, possibly related to
 position of NG tube.
