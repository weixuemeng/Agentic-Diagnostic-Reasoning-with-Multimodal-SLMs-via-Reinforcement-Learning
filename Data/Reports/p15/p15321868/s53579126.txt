                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with urosepsis.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Right internal jugular line tip is currently low, at the level of the right
 atrium and should be pulled back approximately 2.3 cm.  There is interval
 placement of the right nephrostomy, partially imaged.  Pulmonary edema is
 still present, although minimally improved since the prior study.  Right
 middle lobe atelectasis and left retrocardiac density with air bronchogram
 persist, highly worrisome for pneumonia.
