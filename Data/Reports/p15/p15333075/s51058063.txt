                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous.
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are present within the aortic arch. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs are clear without focal consolidation.
 Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly on the lateral view
 may suggest the presence of tiny effusions or pleural thickening. Lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms suggestive of COPD. No
 pneumothorax is identified. Multilevel degenerative changes are present within
 the thoracic spine with anterior bridging osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Probable COPD.  Possible trace
 bilateral pleural effusions versus pleural thickening.
