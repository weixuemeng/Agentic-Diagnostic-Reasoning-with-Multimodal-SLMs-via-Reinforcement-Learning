 Subtle opacity in the right lower lobe is new from the prior exam and may
 represent an atypical infection. Blunting of the costophrenic angles
 posteriorly on the lateral view could represent trace pleural effusions or
 pleural thickening. There is no pneumothorax identified.  Note is made of mild
 rightward tracheal deviation which could be due to an enlarged thyroid.
