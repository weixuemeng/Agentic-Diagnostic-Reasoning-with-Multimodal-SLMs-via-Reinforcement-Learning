 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal

 a 1 cm right upper lobe nodule and an approximately 3 cm left lower lobe
 nodule.  Several smaller nodules documented on the most recent CT chest are
 not visualized on the current exam.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No focal opacity concerning for pneumonia is visualized.  Again
 seen is asymmetry of the breast tissue.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Unchanged right upper lobe and left lower lobe nodules, which are better
 seen on the current exam than on prior radiograph.  Several smaller nodules
 documented on CT chest are not visualized on the current exam.  
 
 2. No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pneumonia.
