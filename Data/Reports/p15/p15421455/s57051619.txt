                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of stage IV lung cancer, presenting with chest pain. 
 Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT from ___.  Subsequent CTA chest from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Multiple nodular opacities are seen throughout both lungs,
 measuring up to 2.6 cm in the left lower lobe, corresponding to known
 pulmonary nodules that have been documented both on prior PET-CT from ___ and subsequent chest CT from ___.  None of these opacities
 has a morphology suggestive of an infectious process.  The heart is top normal
 in size.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  A lobulated contour
 abnormality along the posterior pleural surface corresponds to left-sided
 pleural thickening and fluid on the subsequent CT.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 A sclerotic lesion is seen within the anterior aspect of the T10 vertebral
 body, best appreciated on the lateral projection.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary findings.
 
 2.  Multiple bilateral nodular opacities, corresponding to known pulmonary
 nodules and a left lower lobe pulmonary mass.  Please see the accompanying
 chest CT for details.
 
 3.  Left posterior pleural fluid/thickening, fully assessed on subsequent CT.
