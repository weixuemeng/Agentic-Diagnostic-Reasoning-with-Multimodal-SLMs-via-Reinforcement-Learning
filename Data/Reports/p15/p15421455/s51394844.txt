                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, syncope x1 and
 recent elevated white blood cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
 appearance of the left hemithorax is similar, with a large left pleural
 effusion.  There is subsequent mediastinal shift to the right.  There is a
 possible very subtle increase in opacity projecting over the the remaining
 aerated left upper lung which may be due to interval slight increase in volume
 loss, although infection or disease spread is not excluded.  There is new
 right ___/suprahilar opacity as compared to the prior, which may be due to a
 new site of infection or disease spread.  Hazy right basilar opacity is seen
 which may be due to atelectasis in combination with a small right pleural
 effusion.
