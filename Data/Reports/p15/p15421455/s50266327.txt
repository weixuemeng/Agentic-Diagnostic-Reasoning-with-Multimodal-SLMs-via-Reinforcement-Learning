                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of metastatic lung cancer, currently
 undergoing chemotherapy, who now presents with fever of unknown origin.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PET-CT exam dated ___
 
 FINDINGS:   Frontal and lateral views demonstrate hyperexpanded lungs.  There
 is no pleural effusion or focal consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is top normal.
 The patient's known pulmonary lesions in the left lung base and right upper
 lobe are better seen on CT of ___. Retrocardiac streaky opacity, which
 projects over spine on the lateral view, is noted. A right breast prosthesis
 is in place.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Retrocardiac streaky opacity likely relates to the patient's known left
 lower lobe mass, however an adjacent area of atelectasis and/or infection
 cannot be excluded.  
 2. Right upper lobe opacity corresponds to the previously noted partly solid
 and ground glass opacity in the right upper lobe as seen on PET CT of
 ___.
