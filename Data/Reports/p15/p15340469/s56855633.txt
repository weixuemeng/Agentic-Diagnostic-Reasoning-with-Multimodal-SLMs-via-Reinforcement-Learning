 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There are no focal parenchymal
 opacities.  There is mild bilateral hilar engorgement and vascular upper
 redistribution, suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion, but no overt
 pulmonary edema.  The heart is moderate to severely enlarged and a unicameral

 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion in the setting of moderate
 cardiomegaly.  No focal opacities to suggest pneumonia.
