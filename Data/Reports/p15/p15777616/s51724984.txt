                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post fall, question rib fracture.
 
 COMPARSION: ___
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low, accentuating the lung markings. Cardiac silhouette size is accentuated by
 low lung volumes, but likely is within normal limits. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. 
 No displaced rib fracture is present. Comminuted left humeral head and neck
 fracture is better visualized on concurrently obtained shoulder radiographs. 
 Diffuse vertebral osteopenia and vetebral compression deformities are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Low lung volumes.
 2.  Comminuted left humeral head and neck fracture.
 3.  No displaced rib fractures identified. If there is continued concern, a
 dedicated rib series is recommended.
 4.  Chronic thoracic vertebral compression deformities.
