                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p avr  // eval for effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Previous median sternotomy and aortic valve replacements noted.  A right
 internal jugular catheter terminates at the right atrium.  This could be
 withdrawn 3-4 cm for better seating within the distal SVC.  Compared to the
 prior study, there has been interval development of bilateral pleural
 effusions, larger on the right than the left.  This is associated with a
 atelectasis and superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax
 seen.  The visualized bony structures demonstrate mild multilevel degenerative
 changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than the
 left.  There is associated atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded.
