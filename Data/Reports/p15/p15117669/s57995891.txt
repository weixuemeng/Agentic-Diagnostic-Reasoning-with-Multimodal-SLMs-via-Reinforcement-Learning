                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral chest tubes for empyema complaining of worsening
 left-sided chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___. 
 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  Bilateral pleural pigtail drains and 3
 leads of a left chest wall pacer are in stable position.  Mild interstitial
 edema persists with a new elliptical opacity in the right mid lung region,
 possibly represent a new area of loculated fluid given its incomplete margins.
 Right effusion is otherwise unchanged. Left-sided pleural effusion has
 slightly enlarged with increased retrocardiac opacity consistent with
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild interstitial edema.
 2.  New elliptical opacity in the right mid lung suggestive of loculated
 pleural fluid.
 3.  Slightly increased left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
