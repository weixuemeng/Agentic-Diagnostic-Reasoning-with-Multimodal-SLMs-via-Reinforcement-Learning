 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Empyema.  Follow up effusion.
 
 Preliminary report typed into PACS reads "marked interval improvement of
 loculated right pleural effusion, now small right pigtail catheter
 repositioned and now projects inferior to right lung base.  Persistent left
 lung base atelectasis and likely small effusion".  Signed, ___
 ___).
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable AP upright chest radiograph shows bilateral pulmonary
 pigtail catheters, with that on the right now directed inferiorly beyond its
 entrance into the thoracic cage compared to study from earlier today where it
 was directed superiorly.  There appears to be improvement in aeration of the
 right base and decreased fluid.  Left pigtail catheter is in relatively
 unchanged position.  There remains some consolidation obscuring the left
 medial hemidiaphragm and lower thoracic aorta.  Left-sided pacing device with
 three intact leads is noted.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Improved aeration and decreased fluid right hemithorax and right
 lung base associated with inferiorly repositioned right-sided pigtail drainage
 catheter.  Left-sided catheter and medial basal consolidation unchanged.
