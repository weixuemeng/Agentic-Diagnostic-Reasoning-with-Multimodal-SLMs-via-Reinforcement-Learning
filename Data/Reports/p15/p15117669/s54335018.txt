 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Follow-up of empyema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.  This was earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new drainage catheter projects over the mid hemithorax.  An
 associated fluid collection appears decreased but a small opacity suggesting
 residual fluid projecting over the right mid hemithorax.  Two drainage
 catheters projecting over the left mid-to-lower hemithorax appear unchanged
 with persistent widespread retrocardiac opacification and probably a residual
 small pleural effusion.  Left perihilar opacity is stable.  Streaky opacities
 at the right base remain, but for the most part, aeration has improved
 substantially in the right lower lung.  A PICC line courses into the superior
 vena cava from a right-sided approach.  Its tip is difficult to visualize
 because of coinciding three-lead pacemaker/ICD device, but it probably
 terminates in the superior vena cava.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of posterior drainage tube along the mid right
 hemithorax with decreased fluid.  Improved aeration at the right lung base.
