                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left upper quadrant pain near the costal
 margin.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There is a moderate sized pleural
 based density, suggestive of a loculated pleural effusion in the right lower
 thoracic region, resulting in medial displacement of the lung tissue with
 minimal compressive atelectasis.  An ovoid well-defined opacity projecting
 over the mid lung fissure likely represents a small loculated effusion within
 the fissure at this level.  
 
 There is an ill-defined opacity in the right mid-to-upper lung field. A small
 left-sided pleural effusion is also present.  The aorta is tortuous. The heart
 is mildly enlarged.  A tricameral pacemaker is present with the leads ending
 in appropriate position.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  No
 subdiaphragmatic free air is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Ill defined opacity in the right mid to upper lung suggestive of
 infectious/inflammatory process.
 
 2.  Right-sided loculated pleural based density suggestive of a loculated
 effusion with associated atelectasis of the right lung base.  Superimposed
 infection in this region cannot be excluded.  A small ovoid lesion projecting
 over the minor fissure is likely loculated fluid in the fissure.
 
 CT scan should be considered to further characterize these findings.
