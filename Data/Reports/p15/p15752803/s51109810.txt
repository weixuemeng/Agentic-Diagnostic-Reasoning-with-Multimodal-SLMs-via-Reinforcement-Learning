                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post mini-maze, evaluate for effusion.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  A metallic clamp overlies the left heart. 
 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.  There is
 borderline upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.  There is atelectasis
 at the left base.  Apparent linear atelectasis or scarring in the left lung
 laterally.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated. There is also a small right
 effusion and some atelectasis at the right base.  
 
 Small rounded metallic density is again seen over the right upper chest, now
 actually outside the chest overlying the scapula, ? BB within the patient. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Suspect slight improvement in CHF findings, with slightly more atelectasis
 at the right lung base.  Otherwise, the findings are overall similar to the
 radiograph from chest x-ray from ___ at 9:13 a.m.  
 
 2) Suspected BB adjacent to the right upper chest -- this may lie inside the
 patient. Prior film suggsted the presence of a similar "BB".
