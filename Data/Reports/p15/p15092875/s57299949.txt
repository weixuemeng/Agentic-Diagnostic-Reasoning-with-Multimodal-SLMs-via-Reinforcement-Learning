                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multiple falls.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size
 is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is
 hyperinflation of the lungs with emphysematous changes again noted, most
 pronounced in the lung apices.  Streaky linear opacities within the lung bases
 likely reflect the patient's known bronchiectasis.  Linear scarring is also
 seen within the periphery of the right lung base.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are multilevel mild
 degenerative changes noted within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.  Chronic bronchiectasis
 within the lung bases and emphysema.
