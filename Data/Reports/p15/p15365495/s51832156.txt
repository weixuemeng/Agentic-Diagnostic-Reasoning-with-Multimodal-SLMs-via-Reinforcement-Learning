                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, s/p spinal surgery  // eval for
 infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP semi upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Even allowing for the AP technique and low lung volumes, the heart is probably
 mildly enlarged.  A right subclavian central venous catheter is in the
 proximal SVC.  Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes and mild cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 3.  Central venous catheter terminates in the proximal SVC.
