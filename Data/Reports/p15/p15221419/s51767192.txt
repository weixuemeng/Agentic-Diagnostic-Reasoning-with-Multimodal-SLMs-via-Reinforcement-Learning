                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:___ ___ ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pneumonia.  Now intubated.  Check ET tube
 placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ 7:___ p.m.:
 
 With the chin down, tip of the endotracheal tube at the carina is 3.5 cm too
 low, at 5:___ a.m.  Second image performed at 5:___ a.m. showed that the
 endotracheal tube had been withdrawn, but the tip is no more than 2 cm from
 the carina with the chin partially flexed.  Findings were discussed with Dr.
 ___ at 9:___ a.m. after paging him at 9:___ a.m. within a minute of
 recognizing the pertinent findings.
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is larger today, and there is greater
 opacification of both lungs, probably a component of pulmonary edema obscuring
 previous large scale consolidation in the right mid and lower lung zone and
 smaller consolidation at the left apex.  New consolidation at the left base
 could be either atelectasis or another focus of pneumonia.  Whether the right
 pleural effusion is due to hemodynamic compromise or empyema remains to be
 seen.
 
 Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  No pneumothorax.
