                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ?pneumonia diagnosed from OSH  // PNA?

 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low, accentuating the pulmonary vasculature, with no
 evidence of overt pulmonary edema. Streaky opacification in the left lung base
 could be due to atelectasis alone, however underlying infection cannot be
 excluded. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size
 is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky left lung base opacification, possibly atelectasis, however underlying
 infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
