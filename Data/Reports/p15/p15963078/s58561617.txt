                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Heart failure, extubation, assessment of pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 12:55.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, volumes have slightly
 decreased, likely reflecting a lesser inspiratory effort.  There is unchanged
 evidence of moderate cardiomegaly as well as bilateral pleural effusions and
 subsequent areas of atelectasis.  The changes are more severe on the left than
 on the right.  In the interval, there is no evidence of new parenchymal
 opacities.  No pneumothorax.  No convincing evidence of pulmonary edema.  The
 sternal wires and the right internal jugular vein catheter are in constant
 position.
