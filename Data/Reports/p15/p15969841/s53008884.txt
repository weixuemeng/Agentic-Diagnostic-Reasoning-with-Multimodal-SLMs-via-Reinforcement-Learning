                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Median sternotomy with two chest tubes.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the two chest tubes remain in
 place.  There appears to be a small apical pneumothorax on the left.
 
 Pulmonary vascularity remains within normal limits.  There is some increased
 opacification at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm,
 suggesting some combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion.  Minimal
 atelectatic changes are seen at the right base.
