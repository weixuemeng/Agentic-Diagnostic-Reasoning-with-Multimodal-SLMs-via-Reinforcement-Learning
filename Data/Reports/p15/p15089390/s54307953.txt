                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old, evaluate mediastinum.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP supine chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at the thoracic inlet.  There
 is a nasogastric tube which is now seen coursing below the diaphragm, although
 the tip is not definitely identified.  A left basilar chest tube remains in
 place.  Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the
 proximal to mid SVC.  A left-sided pacer is unchanged in position.  Lung
 volumes remain low with patchy opacity at the left base most likely reflecting
 partial lower lobe atelectasis and/or layering effusion.  The pulmonary
 vasculature appears somewhat ill defined, raising concern for interval
 development of mild interstitial edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely unchanged in this post-operative patient status post
 median sternotomy for CABG.  No large pneumothorax is seen, although the
 sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
