                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 09:27
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post CABG, status post chest tube
 removal.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 16:53.
 
 Portable upright chest from ___ at 9:27 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube and left chest
 tube and mediastinal drains.  Right internal jugular central line and
 left-sided pacer remain in place.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy with stably enlarged cardiac and mediastinal contours.  There is
 increasing opacification at the left lung base, likely reflecting a
 combination of compressive atelectasis and a layering effusion.  Patchy
 opacity at the right base is suggestive of atelectasis as well, although an
 early infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.  Lung volumes are low
 and there is crowding of the vasculature but no pulmonary edema is evident on
 the current study.  No definite pneumothorax is identified.  Followup imaging
 would be advised.
