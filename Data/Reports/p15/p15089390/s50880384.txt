                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the previous study of ___, the patient has taken
 a better inspiration.  Pulmonary vascularity is substantially improved. 
 Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.
 
 Right IJ catheter has been removed, and the pacer device remains in place.
 
 There is increased opacification remaining in the retrocardiac region at the
 left base.  This most likely represents a stage in reexpansion of the
 previously substantially collapsed left lower lobe.  No evidence of acute
 focal pneumonia.
