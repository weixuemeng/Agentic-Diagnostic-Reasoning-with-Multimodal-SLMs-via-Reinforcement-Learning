                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Diabetes and likely diabetic ketoacidosis; question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two ___ project over the right shoulder.  Presumably these lie
 outside of the patient or on the surface.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Two ___ projecting over the
 right shoulder, probably outside of the patient; correlation with direct
 inspection is suggested, however.
