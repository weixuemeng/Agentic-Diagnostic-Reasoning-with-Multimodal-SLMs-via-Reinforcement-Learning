 flattening of the diaphragms.  The heart is enlarged.  There is no evidence to
 suggest pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion.  No focal opacity
 convincing for pneumonia is identified. Note is made of a severe compression
 deformity at the L1 level with vertebroplasty changes.

 No findings convincing for pneumonia. Hyperinflated lungs and flattening of
 the diaphragm suggest chronic obstructive disease. Moderate compression
 deformity of T12 noted with prior vertebroplasty.
