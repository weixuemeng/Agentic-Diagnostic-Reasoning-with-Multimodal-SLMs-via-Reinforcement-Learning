 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:30 PM
  Comparison is made to prior radiograph performed on the same date
  approximately 8 hours prior.  No significant changes have been made. 
  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Central vascular appears
  engorged with airspace opacities which appear to of increased over time to
  suggest volume overload and early pulmonary edema.   Blunting of the right
  costophrenic angle suggests right small pleural effusion.  There is no
  pneumothorax.
