                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with MDS and graft-versus-host disease, with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal semi upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest on ___, chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided PICC line terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Lung volumes
 are low.  Streaky opacities in the lower lungs are better assessed on prior CT
 which may reflect the sequelae of chronic aspiration.  Cardiac size is normal.
 Bilateral patchy opacities in the lower lungs are slightly increased from
 prior.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral streaky opacities at the lung bases are slightly increased from
 prior and consistent with ongoing infectious bronchiolitis.
