                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacity of the lung bases on the lateral view corresponds to left lung base
 consolidation seen on recent CT, not substantially changed from prior studies.
 Increased linear opacities bilaterally likely reflect mild bronchial wall
 thickening.  There is no new focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary
 edema, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The
 osseous structures and upper abdomen are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bronchial wall thickening and an unchanged small posterior left lung base
 opacity seen on the lateral view are likely similar dating to prior CT of ___.  No new focal consolidation.  Tree-in-___ opacities seen on
 prior CT were better appreciated on CT.
