                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ yo M with h/o MDS ___/p MUD HSCT x 2 (___ and ___) c/b
 transplant rejection and graft failure c/b GVHD of the lungs, gut, and skin,
 s/p recent prolonged hospital courses (___ and ___) for
 PNAs, presenting with hypoxia and tachycardia, concern for respiratory failure
 and shock from pulmonary infection, evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Peribronchial consolidations in the bilateral upper lobes are not well
 appreciated on radiograph and better characterized on prior CT from ___.  Peribronchial thickening in the lower lobes is improved.  Pulmonary
 edema is also improved compared to the prior study, now mild.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in peribronchial thickening and pulmonary edema. 
 Scattered peribronchial consolidations are better appreciated from recent
 chest CT and their evolution is hard to assess on radiograph.
