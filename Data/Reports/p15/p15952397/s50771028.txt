                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dyspnea, hypoxia, aspergillus, influenza
 psuedomonoas pna.  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:08
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is the left subclavian PICC line, with tip over cavoatrial
 junction.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 Also again seen are scattered patchy opacities in both lungs, prior study.  A
 small, slightly more confluent focus is now seen in the midclavicular line on
 the left, adjacent to the left third anterior rib.  No gross consolidation or
 effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Scattered patchy opacities in both lungs, overall similar to the prior study. 
 Most likely etiology or multifocal pneumonic infiltrates.  Patchy initial
 development of CHF could have a similar appearance, but is considered less
 likely.
