                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with MDS ___/p HSCT x 2 c/b transplant rejection
 and graft failure c/b GVHD of the lungs, GI tract, and skin, with recurrent
 PNA (stenotrophomonas, pseudomonas, and Aspergillus), intubated  // PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16:04
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left subclavian central line is present, tip over distal most SVC.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
 
 Compared with the prior study, opacification at the right base has progressed.
 Focal opacity in the left upper zone laterally, overlying the inferior left
 scapula, has also progressed.  Faintbackground hazy opacities are again noted.
 It would be difficult to exclude a component of interstitial edema, but
 opacities related to infection might also account for this appearance.
 
 Minimal blunting the right costophrenic angle is new.  Gross effusion
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening opacity at the right lung base and focally in the left upper zone
 laterally.
