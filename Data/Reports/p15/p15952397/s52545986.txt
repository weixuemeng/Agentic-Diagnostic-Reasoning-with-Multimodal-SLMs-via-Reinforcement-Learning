                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with graft vs host lung disease and recurrent
 pneumonia, increasing shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided PICC tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right atrium. 
 Heart size appears top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy ill-defined nodular
 opacities in both lower lobes appear progressed in the interval concerning for
 worsening bronchiolitis.  Other additional patchy areas of focal ill-defined
 opacity in the upper lobes bilaterally appear minimally improved.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased ill-defined patchy nodular opacities in both lung bases concerning
 for worsening infectious bronchiolitis.  Other additional focal patchy
 opacities in the upper lobes bilaterally thought to reflect additional sites
 of small airways disease appear minimally improved.
