                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left-sided back pain and cough.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Heart size and cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal.  On the lateral view, projecting over the mid thoracic
 spine is a region of opacity probably in the superior segment of the left
 lower lobe, probably pneumonia, though not clearly seen on the frontal view. 
 There is no pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  No thoracic vertebral body
 compression fracture or displaced rib fracture appreciated. Rightward
 deviation of the trachea in the neck could be due to a left thyroid mass or
 adenopathy.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probable pneumonia.  Oblique views recommended if additional radiographic
 confirmation is necessary. 
 
 Possible left goiter or cervical adenopathy. Clinical evaluation indicated. 
 
 Dr ___ ___ findings with Dr ___ by phone at 8:20AM.
