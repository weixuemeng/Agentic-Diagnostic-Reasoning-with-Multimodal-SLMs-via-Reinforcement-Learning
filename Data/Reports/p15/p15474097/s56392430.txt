 HISTORY:  CABG 3 weeks ago with nausea and weakness for 3 weeks.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiac silhouette
 size appears unchanged, mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions have decreased in size compared to the prior exam.  Minimal streaky
 opacity in the left lung base is compatible with atelectasis.  There is no
 focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, decreased from the prior study, with
 minimal left basilar atelectasis.
