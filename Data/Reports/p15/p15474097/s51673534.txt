                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, weakness, assess for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  There is obscuration
 of the left CP angle on the lateral view which could indicate a small
 effusion.  Areas of linear density in the left lower lung could be secondary
 to areas of scarring or plate-like atelectasis. Tine right effusion persists.
 No definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 stable.  Bony structure is intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable exam with tiny b/l pleural effusions and lower lung
 plate-like atelectasis versus scarring.
