                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with EKG changes, shortness of breath on
 exertion.  Evaluate for evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hypoinflated.  The right lung is clear, while the
 left lung demonstrates an ill-defined opacity that is obscuring a portion of
 the margin of the left hemidiaphragm, which is confirmed in the lateral view
 where the left hemidiaphragm is not clearly identified.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill-defined opacity in the left lower lung base might represent
 atelectasis, although an infectious/inflammatory process cannot be excluded.
