                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Uveitis, suspected sarcoidosis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is top normal, exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Mediastinum
 assessment demonstrates tortuosity of the aorta as well as irregular
 calcifications at the level of the aortic arch.  Lateral view demonstrates the
 irregular nodular appearance of the aortic arch calcification that might
 represent focal area of calcified aneurysm.  Lungs are clear with no
 abnormalities seen.  No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy is present.  No
 pleural effusion is seen.
 
 Given the above described findings, correlation with chest CT, preferably
 after administration of IV contrast is recommended.
