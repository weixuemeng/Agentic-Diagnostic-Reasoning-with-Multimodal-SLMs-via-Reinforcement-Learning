                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with leukocytosis and R basilar crackles  //
 assess for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of a right internal jugular catheter.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  Bilateral hilar fullness and mild perihilar
 opacities are minimally decreased from the prior study.  Additionally, there
 is volume loss in both upper lobes.  No evidence of focal, infectious
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral hilar fullness and perihilar opacities may represent mild edema. 
 However, volume loss in the bilateral upper lobes in addition to these
 findings may suggest background interstitial lung disease or possibly
 sarcoidosis.  Recommend CT for further evaluation.
