                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ct placement to water seal this am. // acute
 process/worsening ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal terminates 5.7 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube
 terminates over the left upper quadrant, likely within the stomach.  A chest
 tube on the left is unchanged.  A left internal jugular catheter terminates in
 the brachiocephalic SVC junction and has its tip oriented.
 
 Lung volumes are somewhat low, which accentuates bronchovascular markings. 
 There is no focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  A small triangular
 opacity projected over the left lung base suggests atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  Triangular
 opacity at the base of the left lung suggests atelectasis.
 
 Left internal jugular catheter terminates at the brachiocephalic SVC junction
 and has its tip oriented upward.
