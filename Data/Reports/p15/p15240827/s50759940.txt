  Endotracheal tube and enteric tubes in appropriate position.
  
  Left chest tube terminates at the high left lung apex.  No pneumothorax or
  large pleural effusion seen.
  
  Widening of the superior mediastinum may be due to supine position and AP
  technique, although acute mediastinal process is not excluded.  If there is
  clinical concern for such, chest CTA should be considered.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with s/p cardiac arrest eval ett*** WARNING ***
 Multiple patients with same last name!  // eval ett
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately a 4.9 cm above the level
 the carina.  Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level the diaphragm,
 terminating in the expected location of the stomach.  Left-sided chest tube is
 seen, terminating at the left lung apex.  No definite pneumothorax is seen. 
 There is no large pleural effusion.  The cardiac silhouette appears mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinum appears mildly widened which may be due to patient
 position and AP technique although acute mediastinal process is not excluded. 
 Subtle right base opacity may be due to overlap of vascular structures or
 aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube and enteric tubes in appropriate position.
 
 Left chest tube terminates at the high left lung apex.  No pneumothorax or
 large pleural effusion seen.
 
 Widening of the superior mediastinum may be due to supine position and AP
 technique, although acute mediastinal process is not excluded.  If there is
 clinical concern for such, chest CTA should be considered.
