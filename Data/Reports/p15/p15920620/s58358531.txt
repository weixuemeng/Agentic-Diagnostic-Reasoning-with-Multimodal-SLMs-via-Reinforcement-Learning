                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with 10 day history of cough, 2 episodes of
 hemoptysis. Described blood-tinged sputum and a very small amount ___. 
 Reported slightly larger amount on ___ after forceful coughing episode. 
 Treated for fairly significant asthmatic bronchitis.  // Rule out pneumonia,
 versus other cause of hemoptysis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left hilum is enlarged with a somewhat nodular contour.  Given recent
 pulmonary infection with asthmatic symptoms, this could represent
 postinfectious adenopathy, however, with a history of multiple episodes of
 hemoptysis, a central bronchial mass cannot be excluded and chest CT is
 recommended for further evaluation.  The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting
 small airways disease and air trapping, although this can be a normal finding
 in young patients with vigorous inspiratory effort. There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The cardiac
 silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Enlarged left hilum for which a chest CT is recommended.
 2. Hyperinflation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with ___
 ___, NP on the telephone on ___ at 3:57 PM, 10 minutes after
 the discovery of the findings.
