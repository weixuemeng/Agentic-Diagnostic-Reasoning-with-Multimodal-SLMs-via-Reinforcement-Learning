                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p TAVR s/p PPM placement today  // eval for
 volume overload vs PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of a right-sided single lead stem for a
 pacemaker with placement of a purged permanent dual lead pacemaker on the left
 side.  Lead position appears appropriate on this single AP view.  A vascular
 stent is seen at the expected location of the aortic valve.  No pneumothorax,
 consolidation or pleural effusion.  Prominent reticular opacities in bilateral
 lower lobe distribution, unchanged compared to the prior coronary CT and
 likely reflecting fluid overload.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a left-sided pacemaker.
