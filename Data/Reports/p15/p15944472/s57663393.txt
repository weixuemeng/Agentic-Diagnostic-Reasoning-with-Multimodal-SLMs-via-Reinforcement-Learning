                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough, fever and congestion.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Streaky bibasilar opacities are seen, more so on
 the lateral view.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky bibasilar opacities, potentially due to atelectasis given
 lower lung volumes, however, developing infiltrate cannot be entirely
 excluded.
