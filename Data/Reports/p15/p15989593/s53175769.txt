 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  There is minimal patchy left lower lobe patchy opacity
 likely reflective of atelectasis, however contusion or aspiration is not
 excluded.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There mild degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine. 
 Lucency through the posterior left eighth rib is concerning for a nondisplaced
 fracture.

 1. Left posterior eighth rib fracture.
 2. Minimal left lower lobe patchy opacity, potentially atelectasis however
 aspiration or contusion cannot be excluded.
