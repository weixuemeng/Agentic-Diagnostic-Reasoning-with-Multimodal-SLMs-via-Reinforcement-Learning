                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough, dyspnea and fever, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two vascular stents are again noted, the first in the superior vena
 cava and the second in the left brachiocephalic vein, unchanged.  The cardiac
 silhouette is clearly enlarged, but stable compared to the prior study.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Mild calcification
 of the aortic knob is noted.  There is pulmonary vascular congestion with mild
 pulmonary interstitial edema.  No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is detected.  Evaluation is limited due to difficult patient positioning
 secondary to pain with the patient's arm obscuring the lateral radiograph.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Limited evaluation due to patient discomfort and limited positioning. 
 Overall, stable appearance of the chest from ___.
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.
 3.  Stable severe cardiomegaly.
