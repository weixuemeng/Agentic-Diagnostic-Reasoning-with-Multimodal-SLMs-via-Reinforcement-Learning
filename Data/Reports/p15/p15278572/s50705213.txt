                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o female with severe COPD, s/p lung ca recently s/p recent
 hospitalization ___ for PNA at ___  // F/U PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.  And PET-CT of ___
 as well as earlier chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated. A poorly defined peripheral opacity measuring
 5.5 cm in diameter persists in the periphery of the left mid lung,
 corresponding to the site of the patient's treated lung cancer in this region
 with adjacent fiducial seeds. Adjacent rib abnormalities are similar to prior
 radiographs. No new areas of consolidation are identified within the lungs,
 and there are no definite pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar post treatment appearance of the chest. No superimposed foci of
 pneumonia.  Consider chest CT if there is strong clinical suspicion for
 recurrent neoplastic disease or infection.
