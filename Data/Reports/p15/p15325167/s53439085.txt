                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent seizure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable, and no pulmonary vascular congestion is present. 
 Low lung volumes limits the assessment of the lung bases, with streaky
 bibasilar airspace opacities potentially reflecting atelectasis, but infection
 cannot be excluded, particularly in the right lung base.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Streaky opacities in the
 lung bases could reflect atelectasis but infection, particularly of the right
 lung base, cannot be excluded.  Consider repeat radiographs with improved
 inspiratory effort for better assessment of the lung bases.
