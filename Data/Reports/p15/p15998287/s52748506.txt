                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with trauma (left side stab wound per discussion
 with team).  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior imaging is available on PACS at the time of this
 dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Subtle lucency near the aortic knob is not well
 localized on this portable exam and could reflect focal pneumomediastinum or a
 small medial pneumothorax.  Lungs are clear except for patchy bibasilar
 opacities, left greater than right.  .  The heart is normal in size.  The
 thoracic aorta is tortuous and/or ectatic.  Subtle cortical discontinuity in
 left lateral ___ and 6th ribs may reflect non-displaced fractures of
 indeterminate age.  No unexplained radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Subtle lucency knear aortic knob, potentially representing focal
 pneumomediastinum or small medial pneumothorax.  .
 2.  Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis although contusion and aspiration
 are additional considerations.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  The described findings could be initially confirmed and
 further characterized with standard PA and lateral chest radiographs. 
 Alternatively, if the patient is clinically unstable, initial further
 evaluation by CT would be recommended.  .
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 8:05 AM, 1 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
