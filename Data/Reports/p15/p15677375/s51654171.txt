  1. Moderate left-sided pleural effusion, decreased in size from prior.  An
  underlying consolidation is not excluded.
  2. Round right lower lobe opacity is compatible with previously identified
  metastases.
  3. Linear right lower lobe opacities may represent atelectasis or scarring.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough, on chemo.  Evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  PA and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.There is a moderate left-sided pleural effusion,
 decreased in size from prior.  An underlying consolidation is not excluded.  A
 right lower lobe round opacity measuring 2.6 cm is compatible with previously
 identified metastasis.  Right lower lung field linear opacities may represent
 atelectasis or scarring.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
