                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Abnormal contour at the gastroesophageal junction
 corresponds to known metastatic lesion seen on previous CT.  There is
 worsening opacification of the left lung base, a component of which is
 attributable to confluent metastatic disease with atelectasis in the lingula,
 but infection is strongly suspected.  Additionally there is a small left
 pleural effusion.  Linear atelectasis in the right lung base is also
 demonstrated.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.  Partially imaged in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen is a
 percutaneous gastrostomy catheter.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening left basilar opacification concerning for infection superimposed on
 a background of confluent metastatic disease and atelectasis in the lingula. 
 Small left pleural effusion.
