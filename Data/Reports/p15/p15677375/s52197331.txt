                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  pneumonia and fluid status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Comparison is somewhat difficult due to differences in technique.  There is
 interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions.  The left pleural effusion
 is moderate to large in size.  The left heart border is largely obliterated. 
 There is evidence of underlying atelectasis or consolidation.  This is
 probably greater on the left but obscured by pleural fluid.  Mediastinal
 structures appear stable.  The bony thorax is grossly intact.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis and/or
 consolidation.
