                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophageal cancer status post esophagogastrectomy.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 3.4 cm above
 the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm.  The side port lies
 above the diaphragm.  An additional drain appears to be present to the right
 of the mid and lower thoracic spine.  An indwelling catheter is present, with
 tip over upper right atrium.  A thin linear density overlying the left chest
 and mediastinum may represent an epidural catheter -- clinical correlation
 requested.  No pneumothorax detected.  
 
 There is new prominence of the soft tissues to the right of the mediastinum,
 with chain sutures. This is consistent with the described esophagogastrectomy,
 but it would be difficult to assess for focal hematoma in this setting.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and mild unfolding of the aorta are
 unchanged.  There may be  minimal atelectasis at the right-greater-than- left
 bases, with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  However, no CHF, focal
 consolidation or effusion is identified.  No free air is seen beneath the
 diaphragm.  Skin ___ noted over the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Status post esophagogastrectomy.  Lines and tubes as described.  Aside from
 minimal atelectasis, no acute pulmonary process identified.
