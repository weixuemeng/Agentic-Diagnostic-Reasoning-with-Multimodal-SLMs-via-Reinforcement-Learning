 placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 17:28 p.m.
 
 An ET tube is present, the tip lies in satisfactory position approximately 3
 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip near the usual position  at
 the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus.  The side port overlies the right
 heart, presumably situated low in the surgically reconstructed esophagus.  A
 right-sided chest tube is present, with a charp  bend near the right
 paratracheal region.  A right indwelling catheter is present, with tip over
 right atrium.  Apparent epidural catherter present.  Linear density to the
 right of the mid and lower thoracic spine may thought to represent a drain.  
 
 There is bibasilar atelectasis including patchy retrocardiac density,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Minimal
 atelectasis at the right costophrenic angle.  No gross effusion.  Scattered
 subcutaneous emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post esophagogastrectomy.
 
 2.  ET tube in satisfactory position approximately 3 cm above the carina.
