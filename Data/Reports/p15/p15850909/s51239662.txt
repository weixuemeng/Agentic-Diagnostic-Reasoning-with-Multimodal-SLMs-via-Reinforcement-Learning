                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate for interval change status post esophagogastrectomy.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 The patient is status post esophagogastrectomy.  Multiple lines, tubes and
 other devices are again seen.  Again seen is the area of focal opacity in the
 right paratracheal region, which presumably relates to the surgical construct.
 Also again seen are bilateral right-greater-than-left effusions, with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  There is upper zone redistribution
 and mild vascular plethora, which appears improved compared with the film from
 ___ at 5:51 p.m.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Skin ___ noted over
 the abdomen.
