  Endotracheal tube tip at the orifice of the right mainstem bronchus;
  repositioning is recommended. On this image, the right lung is aerated.
  Enteric catheter coursing along the right mediastinum and terminating at the
  level of the diaphragm; exact position difficult to determine in the setting
  of post-operative anatomy. Right chest tube courses superiorly and takes a
  tight turn to terminate inferiorly; clinical correlation for patency is
  recommended. Port-a-cath courses approximately 2 cm into the right atrium.
  Linear hardware coursing along the right of the spine may be within the
  neo-esophagus but is indeterminate on this study; clinical correlation is
  recommended for identity of this object and location. Right mediastinal
  contours are distorted by post-surgical anatomy, limiting evaluation for
  mediastinal hematoma. Epidural catheter noted. Findings, limitations, and
  recommendations were discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 20:25 on ___
  and with Dr. ___ by phone at 20:28 on ___ at time of initial review.
  Bibasilar atelectasis without large pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with esophageal cancer s/p esophagogastrectomy 
 // eval for ptx s/p esophagogastrectomy
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 esophagectomy. All monitoring and support devices.  Are in correct position,
 except for the endotracheal tube that is at the orifice of the right main
 bronchus. Immediate withdrawal has to be performed. The these already
 documented on later films.  Expected appearance of the right postoperative
 hemi thorax with the new esophagus, minimal atelectasis at the left lung
 bases. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
