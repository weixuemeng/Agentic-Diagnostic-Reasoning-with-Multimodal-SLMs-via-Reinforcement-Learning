                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophageal cancer status post stent placement at GE junction for
 stenosis, continuing epigastric pain.Question stent placement
 pneumomediastinum.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at ___ p.m., a stent has been placed and appears to
 cross the GE junction, with segmental narrowing in that area.  The more distal
 portion of the stent overlies the upper stomach, extending to the left lateral
 edge of the gas distended portion of the stomach, presumably to the lateral
 gastric wall.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, within normal
 limits except for mild unfolding of the aorta.  No pneumomediastinum,
 pneumothorax, or free subdiaphragmatic air is identified.  A left subclavian
 PICC line tip overlies the distal SVC.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion.
 Possible trace subsegmental atelectasis at the left base.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  GE junction stent placed.  Clinical correlation requested for full
 assessment.
 2.  No evidence of pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, or free subdiaphragmatic
 air.  No acute pulmonary process.
