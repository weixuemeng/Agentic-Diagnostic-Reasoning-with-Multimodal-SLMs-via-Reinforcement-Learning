                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear with no evidence of consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No acute fractures are
 identified. There is slight prominence of the superior mediastinal tissues,
 likely due to technique. If further characterization is necessary, PA and
 lateral radiographs may be obtained.
