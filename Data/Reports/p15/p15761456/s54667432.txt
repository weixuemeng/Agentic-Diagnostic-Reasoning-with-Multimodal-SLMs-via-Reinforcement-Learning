                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new ETT and CVL s/p PEA arrest  // ETT and
 CVL position?      ETT and CVL position?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 14:16.  ET tube and
 right jugular line are in standard placements respectively.  No pneumothorax
 or mediastinal widening.  Large right pleural effusion is larger, but may not
 be related to line placement.  Nasogastric drainage tube passes as far as the
 gastroesophageal junction and out of view.
 
 Mild interstitial edema is new.  Consolidation at the base of the right lung
 is appreciably worse, but whether this collapse of the lower lobe, or less
 likely pneumonia, is radiographically indeterminate.
