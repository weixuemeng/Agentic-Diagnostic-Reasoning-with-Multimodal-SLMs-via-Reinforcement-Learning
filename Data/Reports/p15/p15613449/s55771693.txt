                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation  // eval tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two portable supine radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to outside hospital radiographs obtained at
 06:03 (___ ER).
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is in place and unchanged in position, terminating 3.3 cm
 above the level the carina. A nasogastric tube is now also in place,
 terminating in the fundus of the stomach. Since the prior study, there has
 been interval development of bilateral lower lobe consolidations, concerning
 for aspiration or pneumonia. The lung volumes remain somewhat low, with
 persistent mild pulmonary edema. The heart size is unchanged. There is no
 pneumothorax. Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles likely reflects
 small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Interval development of bilateral lower lobe consolidations since the prior
 study, concerning for aspiration, pneumonia, or pulmonary hemorrhage in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 2. Likely small bilateral pleural effusions.
