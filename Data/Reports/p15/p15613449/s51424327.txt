 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with potential aspiration event  // ?interval
 change      ?interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ 08:25
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lower airspace consolidation is not significantly changed. However,
 there is now patchy opacity in the right upper lobe abutting the minor
 fissure. Findings could reflect aspiration, pneumonia, or pulmonary contusion
 in the correct clinical setting.  There is improved aeration at the left base
 although there is likely some residual atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema. 
 Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube unchanged in position. Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.
