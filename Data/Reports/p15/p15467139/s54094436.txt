                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  On amiodarone, to exclude toxicity.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and
 no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Stable prominence of the
 cardiac silhouette and hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic
 pulmonary disease.  However, no acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
 
 Specifically, no interstitial prominence or dense spleen that would be signs
 of amiodarone toxicity.
