                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  There is a somewhat linear opacity in the
 retrocardiac region, along the left margin of the heart, which appears to
 correlate with an opacity in the retrocardiac region in the lateral view.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Linear retrocardiac opacity, potentially atelectasis although infection cannot
 be entirely excluded.
