                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain and left arm pain, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Left-sided pacemaker is noted with leads
 terminating over right atrium and right ventricle, respsectively.  Sternotomy
 wires are midline and intact.  Bibasilar opacification likely represents
 atelectasis; however, infectious process, although less likely, cannot be
 excluded in the correct clinical setting. Peripheral calcified opacities in
 both lungs are stable since the prior exam and could represent plaques or
 calcified nodules.
 
 The cardiac mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged since the prior
 examination with heart size remaining top normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
