                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ESRD ___ membranous nephropathy admitted for
 acute renal failure, hypertensive emergency with ?L pleural effusion,
 decreased breath sounds on L.  // Eval left lung effusion vs consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, there is been interval
 removal of a right central venous catheter and subsequent placement of a
 double-lumen right central venous catheter.  Left pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  No pleural effusion on the right. Left-sided pulmonary edema
 appears to have resolved, though may be a function of positioning.  The right
 lung remains clear.  No focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax.
 Double-lumen hemodialysis catheter tip terminates in the right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged moderate left pleural effusion.
 2. Resolution of left-sided pulmonary edema, which may reflect changes in
 patient positioning.
 3. Interval placement of right double-lumen hemodialysis catheter with tip
 terminating in the right atrium.
