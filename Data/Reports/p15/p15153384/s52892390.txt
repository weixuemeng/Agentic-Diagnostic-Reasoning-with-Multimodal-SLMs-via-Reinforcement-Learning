                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis with worsening peripheral edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again, the cardiac silhouette is mildly prominent, but there is no
 definite vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. 
 Opacification in the upper liver is related to chemoembolization.
