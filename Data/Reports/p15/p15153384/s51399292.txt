                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with bilateral lower extremity edema and
 lethargy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Increased interstitial
 markings seen in the lungs, particularly in the right upper lung.  This is
 unchanged from prior.  Linear left mid lung opacity suggests atelectasis and a
 more focal density projecting over the left lung laterally as well.  There is
 a small persistent right-sided effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
 stable in configuration.  Old right posterolateral fifth, sixth and seventh
 rib fractures are identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen. 
 Compression deformity of the lower thoracic spine is unchanged.  Vascular
 stent is seen within the abdomen.  Rounded calcific density again seen in the
 right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right effusion.  Patchy region of consolidation in the left
 lung laterally, nonspecific and can be followed on followup exams.
