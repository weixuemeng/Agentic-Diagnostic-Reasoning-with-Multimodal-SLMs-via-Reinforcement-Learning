                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Bilateral pleural effusion, thoracocentesis, pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Because today's exam is erect PA and lateral the exact comparison of the
 pneumothorax is hard to assess.  It has not changed significantly and is still
 small at apex measuring 9 mm.  There is now air-fluid level seen inferiorly. 
 Prior sternotomy was done for CABG in this patient with moderate cardiomegaly,
 left lung is unremarkable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 No significant change in small right hydropneumothorax considering the
 difference in positioning of the patient.
