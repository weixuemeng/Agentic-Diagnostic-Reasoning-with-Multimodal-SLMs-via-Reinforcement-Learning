                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior studies.  The overall volume of a moderate right hydropneumothorax is
 unchanged, but the fluid component has progressively increased since ___.  Right lung atelectasis is unchanged and the left lung is clear. 
 Chronically engorged pulmonary vessels and a moderately-enlarged heart are
 unchanged.  No pulmonary edema or left sided pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The overall volume of a moderate hydropneumothorax is unchanged; however,
 the fluid component has increased, presumably as the air is resorbed in the
 face of pleural restriction limiting reexpansion of the right lung.
 2.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly and chronic engorged pulmonary vessels.
