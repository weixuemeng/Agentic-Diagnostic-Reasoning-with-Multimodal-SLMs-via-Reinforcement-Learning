                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Midline sternotomy
 wires and mediastinal clips are again noted as well as a prosthetic cardiac
 valve.  As seen previously, there is an area of scarring and loculated
 effusion obscuring the right lung base which is stable from multiple prior
 exams.  The left lung is clear.  Heart is top normal in size.  No
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable opacity and effusion at the right lung base which has been
 previously seen and agree with recommendation on prior CT for pleural fluid
 analysis if not already performed.
