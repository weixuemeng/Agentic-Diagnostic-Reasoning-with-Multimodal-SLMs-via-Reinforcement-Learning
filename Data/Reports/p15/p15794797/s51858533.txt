                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of right-sided IJ line. Median sternotomy
 wires and mediastinal surgical clips are noted.  Again seen is severe
 cardiomegaly, unchanged from prior.  There is evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion without overt pulmonary edema, possibly minimally improved in
 comparison to prior exam.  The may be a persistent trace right pleural
 effusion.  There is no left pleural effusion. There is no focal lung
 consolidation. An abnormal appearance of the right lower lung is similar to
 priors, at least in part due to right pleural thickening. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Irregular appearance of the right lower lung due to pleural thickening and
 basilar atelectasis, lowering the sensitivity for the detection of pneumonia
 in this region. If clinically suspsected, CT could further evaluate this area.
 2. Interval removal of right IJ line. Stable severe cardiomegaly. Pulmonary
 vascular congestion persists, possibly minimally improved. No overt pulmonary
 edema. Persistent trace right pleural effusion.
