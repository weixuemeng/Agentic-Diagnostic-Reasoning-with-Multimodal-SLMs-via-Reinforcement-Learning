                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Loculated pleural effusion, here to evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  Multiple mediastinal
 surgical clips are compatible with prior CABG surgery.  A prosthetic cardiac
 valve is also redemonstrated.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size,
 but stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  As
 seen previously, there is an area of scarring and loculated effusion obscuring
 the right lung base, which is stable over multiple prior studies.  The left
 lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable scarring and loculated pleural effusion at the right lung
 base.
