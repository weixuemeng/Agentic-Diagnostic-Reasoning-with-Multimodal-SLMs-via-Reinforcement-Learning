                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with complicated right pleural effusion and
 shortness of breath after drainage.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Moderate residual right pleural effusion and associated pleural thickening and
 atelectasis in the right middle lobe are all essentially unchanged since ___.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left lung and left pleural space are normal. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding, but there is no mediastinal or
 pulmonary vascular engorgement to suggest cardiac decompensation.  This
 examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus.
