                                 FINAL REPORT

 INDICATION:  History: ___F with past medical history of congestive heart
 failure presents with symptoms of volume overload as well as productive cough,
 shortness breath, chest pain

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy, tricuspid valve replacement, and
 CABG.  Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  There is mild
 pulmonary edema, similar to that seen on the prior examination.  Linear and
 patchy opacification in the right lung base is compatible with atelectasis
 and/or scarring, with a small right pleural effusion and right lateral pleural
 thickening appearing unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small right pleural effusion, similar to that seen on
 the prior study.  Linear opacities in the right lung base likely reflect
 atelectasis and/or scarring.
