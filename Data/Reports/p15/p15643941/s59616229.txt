                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with weakness  // r/o pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Midline sternotomy wires and
 prosthetic cardiac valve again noted.  There is subtle opacity projecting over
 the bilateral lung apices on knee frontal view which likely represents
 prominent costochondral junction calcification though difficult to exclude an
 underlying lesion.  Otherwise the lungs appear clear.  No pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or signs of edema.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Right
 hemidiaphragm remains mildly elevated.  Surgical anchors project over the
 right humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague opacity in the upper lungs likely represent prominent costochondral
 junction calcification - recommend apical lordotic view to better assess. 
 Otherwise unremarkable exam.
