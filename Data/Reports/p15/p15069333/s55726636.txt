                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Swallowed pill capsule for endoscopy, to assess for impaction.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no change in the
 appearance of the heart and lungs with mild tortuosity of the aorta.  Mild
 hyperexpansion of the lungs could reflect some chronic pulmonary disease,
 though there is no evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
 
 No evidence of impacted opaque foreign body.
