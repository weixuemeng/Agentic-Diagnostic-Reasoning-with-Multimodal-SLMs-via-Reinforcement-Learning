                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with tachypnea.  Assess for pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to a chest CT dated ___.
 
 A portable supine chest film ___ at 10:07 p.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There is patchy retrocardiac opacity and to a lesser extent at the right
 medial lung base.  These findings are concerning for pneumonia or aspiration
 given the clinical history.  There is some fullness of the perihilar
 vasculature, but no overt pulmonary edema is evident.  There is likely a small
 layering left effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Heart is upper limits of
 normal in size for portable technique.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 Surgical clip in the right upper quadrant likely reflects prior
 cholecystectomy.
