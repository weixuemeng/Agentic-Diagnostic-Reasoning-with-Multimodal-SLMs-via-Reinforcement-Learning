                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Upper GI bleed, history esophageal cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___, CT Chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single AP chest radiograph was obtained.  The lungs are well expanded and
 clear.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax. Mild left basilar opacity likely
 reflects atelectasis. Minimal interstitial abnormality within the right mid
 lung field appears to correlate to tree-in-___ opacities on the prior Chest
 CT, and could reflect chronic aspiration. There is mild elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm which is chronic.  A stent projects over the gastroesophageal
 junction and extends into the upper aspect of the stomach.  Dual cardiac
 pacing leads are in stable position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stent positioned within the gastroesophageal junction and extending into the
 upper stomach.
