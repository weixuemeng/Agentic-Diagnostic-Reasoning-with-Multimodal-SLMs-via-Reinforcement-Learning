 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:11 PM
  Heart is enlarged.  Increased opacity at the right lung base could reflect
  atelectasis, however in the appropriate clinical setting an infectious process
  cannot be excluded.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions and
  prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.  Findings discussed with Dr. ___
  by ___ via telephone on ___ at 9:15 p.m., 3 minutes

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with increasing oxygen requirement, post-op
 day 2 from TAH-BSO, question atelectasis, question pneumonia.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There are patchy bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, small effusions
 and some prominence of the interstitium with Kerley lines.  These findings
 would favor mild pulmonary and interstitial edema.  Superimposed infectious
 process at the lung bases cannot be entirely excluded but can be better
 assessed on followup imaging.  Heart is enlarged, which may reflect
 cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. 
 Mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  No pneumothorax.
