                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension with
 failure to thrive.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  The hilar contours are stable, with no evidence of pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Minimal streaky opacity within the retrocardiac region
 likely reflects atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Multilevel degenerative changes are
 present within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild retrocardiac atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
