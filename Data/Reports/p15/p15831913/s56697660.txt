                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new b/l coarse breath sounds s/p left
 thoracentesis (1.4 L drain) ___  // re accumulation effusion vs chf? prior
 call at OSH of ?pna of left lower lobe...is there evidence of that
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with chest radiograph from ___, small bilateral effusions
 are minimally improved.   New consolidation at the left lung base with
 associated air bronchograms suggests atelectasis or pneumonia.  Mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema is more prominent on the right, though this is
 likely reflective of positional differences and total volume is unlikely
 significantly changed.  No pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New consolidation at the left lung base with associated air bronchograms
 suggests atelectasis or pneumonia.  Recommend correlation with physical exam
 and laboratory results.
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3. Stable mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 4. Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
