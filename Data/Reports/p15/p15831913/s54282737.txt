                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pna, s/p left thoracentesis  // post-___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior chest radiograph performed earlier on the same date, there has
 been near interval resolution of the left pleural effusion.  There is still
 minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which may represent trace
 residual effusion.  No pleural effusion on the right.  Mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema persist.  No consolidation.  No pneumothorax.  Stable
 cardiomegaly.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Substantial improvement in left pleural effusion, with only trace residual
 effusion on the left.
 2. Stable mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
