                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new single chamber ICD  // lead placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to previous chest radiograph done ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single lead ICD with lead tip in situ in the right ventricle.  Post CABG
 changes.  Transverse cardiomegaly.  Mild distention of the upper lobe
 pulmonary vessels suggests either fluid overload or early cardiac
 decompensation.  Bilateral pleural effusions (left larger than right) best
 seen on the lateral view.  No left sided pneumothorax.  The previously noted
 consolidation seen in the posterior basilar aspect of the left lower lobe is
 not clearly visualized on today's study, but may be obscured by the effusion. 
 No subdiaphragmatic free air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Single lead ICD with the lead tip in situ in the right ventricle. No
 left-sided pneumothorax.  Bilateral pleural effusions left larger than right.
