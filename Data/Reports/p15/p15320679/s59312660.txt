                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoglycemia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There are streaky opacities
 in the left mid lung which appear increased, suggestin opacity superimposed on
 background scarring.  There is also focal opacification of the left lower
 hemithorax on the lateral view, new since the prior study and projecting
 primarily over the visualized lower thoracic spine.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The patient is status post right shoulder
 hemiarthroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased posterior opacification, probably in the left lower
 lobe, a finding which could be seen with atelectasis, but pneumonia could also
 be considered in the appropriate setting.
