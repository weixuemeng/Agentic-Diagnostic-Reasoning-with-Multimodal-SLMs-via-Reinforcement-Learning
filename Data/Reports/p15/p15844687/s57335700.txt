                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension.  Evaluate right internal jugular catheter.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  This is accentuating the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, although there is likely moderate-to-severe
 cardiomegaly.  The mediastinum is prominent, which could be due to technique. 
 A right internal jugular catheter is present with the tip in the low SVC. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.
 There is no pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right internal jugular catheter with tip in the low SVC.
 2.  Probable moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly.
 3.  Minimally widened mediastinal contours, which is likely due to technique,
 although if clinical concern is present for aortic pathology, could further
 evaluate with a CT of the chest.
