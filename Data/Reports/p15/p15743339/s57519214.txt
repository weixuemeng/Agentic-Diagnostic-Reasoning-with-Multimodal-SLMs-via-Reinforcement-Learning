                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever and chills with some shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  There is some apparent crowding of bronchovascular
 structures projecting over the right lower lung that correlate to
 bronchovascular thickening probably in the right middle lobe.  There are also
 streaky bronchovascular opacities in the retrocardiac area referring to the
 left lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting bronchopneumonia.
