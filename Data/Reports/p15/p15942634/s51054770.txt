                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with history of atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban, HCV
 cirrhosis presenting with left distal femur fracture and bilateral pleural
 effusions after a fall.  // interval change    interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The apparent volume of previously large right pleural effusion has decreased. 
 Heart size is normal.  Equalization of pulmonary blood flow can be explained
 by supine positioning.  Bibasilar atelectasis is relatively mild.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such
 abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is
 clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings  should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
