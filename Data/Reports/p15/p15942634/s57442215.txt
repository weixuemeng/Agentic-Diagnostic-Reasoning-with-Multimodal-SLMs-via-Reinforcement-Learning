 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the region of
 the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins.  No large pneumothorax is
 identified on this supine exam.  Hazy opacification of the right hemithorax
 likely reflects a large layering right pleural effusion.  Moderate to severe
 cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 relatively unchanged.  No focal consolidation or overt pulmonary edema is
 clearly evident.  Rotary dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is again noted.
