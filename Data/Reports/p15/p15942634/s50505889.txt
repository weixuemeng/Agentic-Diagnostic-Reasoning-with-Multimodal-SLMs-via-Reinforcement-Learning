                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable CXR
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis s/p NGT  // NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable CXR
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The NG tube terminates in no further than the upper stomach, which suggests
 that the sideport is within the distal esophagus.  The right subclavian line
 terminates in the mid-SVC.  Otherwise no significant interval change compared
 to yesterday's CXR.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New NG tube is no further than the upper stomach, suggesting that the sidehole
 is in the distal esophagus.  This should be advanced by at least 5-6cm.
