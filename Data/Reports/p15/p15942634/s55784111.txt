 The NG tube terminates at least in the upper stomach.  There is unchanged
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with poorly defined vascular markings,
 particularly on the right, suggesting elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
 In the appropriate clinical setting, a basilar pneumonia should be considered.
 There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
