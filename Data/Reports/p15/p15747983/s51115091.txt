                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with SIRS and liver mets,
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT abdomen from ___.
 
 The chest radiograph demonstrates normal appearance of the heart and the
 mediastinum.  Right pleural effusion is present, moderate.  Overall lungs are
 clear within the limitations of the study technique.  There is no pneumothorax
 demonstrated.  Assessment of the mediastinum if clinically warranted should be
 obtained with chest CT to exclude the possibility of mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy that might potentially be present and not definitely depicted
 on the chest radiograph.
