                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea, end-stage renal disease, not dialyzed for
 three days.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, increased since
 prior.  No left pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is quite
 enlarged and almost a globular configuration, although similar to prior, may
 due to underlying cardiomyopathy, underlying pericardial effusion not
 excluded.  There is persistent prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature
 suggesting component of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
