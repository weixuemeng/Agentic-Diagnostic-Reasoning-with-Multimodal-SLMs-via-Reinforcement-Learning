 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
 moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and evidence of moderate pulmonary edema.  The
 lung volumes are relatively low compared to the previous examination.  There
 is no evidence of a pleural effusion, an apical cap or a contour irregularity
 along the aortic arch or the descending aorta.  Nevertheless, if the clinical
 symptoms persist, evaluation with CT should be performed.
