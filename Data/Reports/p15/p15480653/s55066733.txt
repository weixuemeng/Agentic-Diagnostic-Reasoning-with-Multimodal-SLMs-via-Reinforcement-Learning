                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  In retrospect, the minimally increased densities at the lung apices
 are likely the result of both patient positioning and a technical projection
 phenomenon. Therefore, a repeat radiograph in ___ month would be a reasonable
 option for monitoring the change and serve as a basis for decisions on further
 workup.

 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with post breast XRT COP on slow pred taper  //
 assess for any flare in opacities
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Chest radiograph, PA and lateral views
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperexpanded.  There is no consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal size. There
 are increased opacities at bilateral lung apices with pleural thickening,
 compared to ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral apical opacities and pleural thickening are increased compared to
