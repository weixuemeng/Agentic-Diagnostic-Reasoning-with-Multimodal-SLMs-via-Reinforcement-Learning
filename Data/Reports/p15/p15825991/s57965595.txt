                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension after surgical procedure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The patient is status post bilateral
 mastectomy.  Since the prior examination, a right-sided breast drain has been
 placed and the previously seen air-fluid level in this location has resolved. 
 A surgical device is seen within the left breast area.  Opacities within the
 left lower lobe are seen.  The right lung is clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is top normal.  There are
 degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe opacities likely are atelectasis but pneumonia or
 aspiration in the correct clinical setting cannot be excluded.
