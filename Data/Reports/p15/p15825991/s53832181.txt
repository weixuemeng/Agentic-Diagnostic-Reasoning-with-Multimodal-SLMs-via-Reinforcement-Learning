                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post bilateral mastectomies.  Since the prior
 radiograph on ___, the bilateral drains have been removed.  Two
 linear lucent areas are present overlying the right breastan.  There may be
 some layering of fluid within the air.  A third focus of air is present
 overlying the left breast, but only partially imaged.
 
 The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  The previously seen right
 basilar opacity has improved.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Areas of lucency overlying the right and left breast; query artifact or
 subcutaneous air.  This may be secondary to recent drain removal, although
 infection cannot be excluded.
 2.  No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 11:00 a.m. on ___ via
 telephone by Dr. ___.
