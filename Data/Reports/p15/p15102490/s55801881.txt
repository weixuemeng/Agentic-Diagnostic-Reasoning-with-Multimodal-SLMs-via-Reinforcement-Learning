 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided dual-lead pacer remains in place with its leads terminating
 over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle
 respectively.  Right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the proximal-to-mid
 SVC, unchanged.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with
 the tip projecting likely within the stomach.  An endotracheal tube is again
 identified with its tip approximately 5.5 cm above the carina, also unchanged.
 Status post median sternotomy with a mitral valve replacement.  Overall
 cardiac size is stable.  There has been interval improvement in aeration at
 the left base with some streaky residual linear opacities noted at both mid
 and lower lungs suggestive of patchy atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 No pulmonary edema.  No layering effusions.
