 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with syncope.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  No priors.  Lungs are clear of

 retrocardiac region at the left lung base measuring approximately 1 cm, also
 seen on the lateral view.  Cardiac silhouette is slighly enlarged.  The aorta
 is torturous with atherosclerotic calcification at the arch.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Cardiomegaly.   Possible
 nodule in the retrocardiac region for which repeat exam with PA technique and
 lateral view is recommended.
 
 An email regarding the recommendation for repeat chest radiographs in
 short-term follow-up of a possible nodule was sent the ER QA nursing group.
