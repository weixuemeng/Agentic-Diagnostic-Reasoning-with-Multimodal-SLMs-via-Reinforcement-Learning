                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is extensive calcification of
 the costochondral junctions.  Subtle basilar interstitial opacities are new. 
 In the setting of hypoxia, findings are concerning for pulmonary edema or
 atypical infection.  No focal confluent consolidation is identified.  Blunting
 of the bilateral costophrenic angles may be secondary to chronic pleural
 thickening, though small effusions cannot be excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Surgical clips are partially imaged in the region of the neck in this patient
 with history of head and neck cancer.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New basilar interstitial opacities which may reflect atypical infection or
 mild pulmonary edema
