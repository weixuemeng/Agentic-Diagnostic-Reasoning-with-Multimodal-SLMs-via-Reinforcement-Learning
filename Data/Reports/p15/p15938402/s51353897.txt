                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with MVA and now with mid thoracic and posterior
 chest wall pain on the right side.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung volumes are somewhat
 low, though there is no focal consolidation, large effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Faint linear density in the left lower lung likely represents mild
 subsegmental atelectasis.  There is retrocardiac air containing structure
 likely representing a small hiatal hernia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  No definite displaced rib fracture is seen.  Anchors are partially
 noted visualized at the level of the right shoulder.  A chronic compression
 deformity of T12 is partially visualized on the lateral view.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute findings.  Small hiatal hernia.
