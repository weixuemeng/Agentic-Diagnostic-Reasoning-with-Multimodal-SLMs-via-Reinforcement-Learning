                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal. Lungs are hyperinflated.  Linear opacity in the left upper lobe is
 compatible with scarring.  There is mild peribronchial cuffing and airway wall
 thickening, most pronounced in the left lower lobe, suggestive of mild
 bronchitis, as seen on the previous CT. No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are mild degenerative changes noted
 throughout the thoracic spine.  Left-sided rib deformities are re-
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggestive of mild bronchitis, better assessed on the previous CT. 
 No pneumonia.
