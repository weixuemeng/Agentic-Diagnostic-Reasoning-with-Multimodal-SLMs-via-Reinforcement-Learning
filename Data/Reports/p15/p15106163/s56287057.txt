                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with wheezing and cough, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There is
 hyperinflation of the lungs with coarsened interstitial markings and widened
 AP diameter of the chest, which is most compatible with underlying emphysema. 
 There is no superimposed pneumonia, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Areas of
 pleural thickening at the right lung apex noted.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of emphysema/COPD without superimposed
 pneumonia.
