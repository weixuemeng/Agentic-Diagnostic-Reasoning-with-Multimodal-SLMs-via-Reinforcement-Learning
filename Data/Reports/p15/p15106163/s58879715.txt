                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragm suggestive of chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Coarsened interstitial markings bilaterally
 are stable consistent with chronic lung disease, with likely emphysema. 
 Biapical pleural thickening is again seen.  No new focal consolidation is
 seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  No focal consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia radiographically.
