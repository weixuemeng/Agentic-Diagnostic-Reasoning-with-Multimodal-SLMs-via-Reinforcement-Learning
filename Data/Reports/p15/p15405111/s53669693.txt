                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___ and the CT of ___, there is again
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour.  Opacification at the left
 base is consistent with some combination of volume loss in the lower lobe and
 pleural effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
 
 The right lung is essentially clear.  The tip of the right central catheter is
 in the mid portion of the SVC.
