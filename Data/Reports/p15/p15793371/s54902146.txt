                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of IV drug use, presenting with fevers and altered mental
 status.  Now intubated.  Assess for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single AP radiograph of the chest was acquired.  The endotracheal
 tube is low lying, ending 1.2 cm above the level of the carina.  An enteric
 catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm and out of the field of view
 inferiorly.  Lung volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and
 accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is mild-to-moderate left
 retrocardiac atelectasis and minimal right lower lung atelectasis.  Aspiration
 pneumonitis at the left lung base is not excluded.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The heart
 size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal allowing for supine
 technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Low lung volumes with mild-to-moderate left lower lung atelectasis and
 minimal right lower lung atelectasis.  Left lower lung aspiration pneumonitis
 in the setting of recent intubation is not excluded.
 
 2.  Low-lying endotracheal tube terminating 1.3 cm above the level of the
 carina.  Recommend retraction by 2-3 cm.
