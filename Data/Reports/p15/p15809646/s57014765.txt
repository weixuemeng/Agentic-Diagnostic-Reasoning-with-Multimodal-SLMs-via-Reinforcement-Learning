                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ as well as older chest radiographs dating to
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size, stable compared to prior
 studies.  Aorta is tortuous.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Bilateral
 pleural thickening and plaques are present, in keeping with history of
 previous asbestos exposure.  Additionally, a linearly oriented opacity is
 present in the lingula, previously attributed to an area of round atelectasis
 on prior CT chest of ___.  Multifocal areas of linear scarring
 and/or atelectasis are also present predominantly in the mid and lower lungs. 
 No superimposed areas of consolidation are identified to suggest an acute
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Asbestos-related pleural disease with adjacent foci of
 parenchymal scarring and/or atelectasis.  No evidence of acute pneumonia, but
 a subtle pneumonia may be difficult to detect in the setting of chronic
 pleural and parenchymal disease.
