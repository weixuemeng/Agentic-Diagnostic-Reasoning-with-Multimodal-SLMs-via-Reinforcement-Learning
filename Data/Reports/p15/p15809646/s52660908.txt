                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with COPD, increasing dyspnea and cough,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest CTs dating back to ___, most
 recently ___, and chest radiograph most recent ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a 3-cm irregularly marginated mass in the lingula, which
 has grown since prior studies.  Other previous findings including the right
 lower lobe round atelectasis and bilateral pleural plaques/pleural thickening
 appear similar to prior studies.  The cardiac silhouette is stable and top
 normal in size.  The aorta is slightly tortuous but stable in appearance. 
 Linear vertically oriented opacity seen in previous chest radiographs appears
 unchanged, most likely represent scarring adjacent to pleural plaques.  Lungs
 are hyperinflated suggesting COPD. There is stable persistent blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle and stable interstitial opacities within the lower
 lungs.  Stable multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are
 noted.  There are scattered areas of focal pleural thickening noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Irregularly marginated 3-cm mass in the lingula has grown since prior studies.
 Although previously attributed to round atelectasis, its  growth and margins
 raise the potential concern for a slowly growing lung adenocarcinoma.  CT of
 the chest is recommended for further evaluation of this finding.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ via phone at 3:05 p.m.
