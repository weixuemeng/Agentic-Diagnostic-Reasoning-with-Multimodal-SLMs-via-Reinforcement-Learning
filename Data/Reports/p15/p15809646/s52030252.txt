                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute respiratory failure, questionable interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are in unchanged position.  There are improved lung volumes, notably
 on the left, potentially reflecting increased ventilatory pressure. 
 Currently, there is no overt pulmonary edema.  Atelectatic changes are seen at
 both lung bases, right more than left, no new parenchymal opacities, unchanged
 moderate cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
