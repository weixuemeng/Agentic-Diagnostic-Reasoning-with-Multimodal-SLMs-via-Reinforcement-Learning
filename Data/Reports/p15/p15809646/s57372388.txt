                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, here to evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies dated ___, ___,
 ___ and ___.  CT chest with contrast dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an irregular rounded opacity in the left mid lung zone,
 which was previously seen on ___ and ___ and thought to represent an
 area of round atelectasis which has resolved in the interim and recurred. 
 Bilateral pleural plaques and pleural thickening is unchanged from prior
 studies.  Increased hazy opacification of the lungs may represent mild
 pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable.  Prominence of the mediastinum is
 unchanged with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The lungs remain
 hyperinflated suggesting COPD.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Recurrent rounded atelectasis in the left mid lung as seen on the prior CT
 of ___. 
 2. Asbestos related lung disease.  
 3. Hazy opacification of the bilateral lungs may represent mild pulmonary
 edema.
