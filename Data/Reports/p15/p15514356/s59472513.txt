 INDICATION:  History of COPD with desaturations.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal with mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Hilar
 contours are normal.  Lungs are hyperinflated with increased biapical lucency
 and loss of architecture suggestive of emphysema.  There is trace scarring in
 the right apex.  There is no dense consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Pleural
 surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
