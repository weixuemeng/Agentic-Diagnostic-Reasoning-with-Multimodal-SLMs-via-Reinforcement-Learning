 COMPARISON:   Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are notable for mild left lower lobe atelectasis.  No large pleural
 effusion although blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles could
 represent small effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Mild bilateral symmetric
 irregular apical pleural thickening is unchanged since prior examination. 
 Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Again noted are bilateral breast implants.  Visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable with mild multilevel degenerative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Specifically, no pneumonia.
