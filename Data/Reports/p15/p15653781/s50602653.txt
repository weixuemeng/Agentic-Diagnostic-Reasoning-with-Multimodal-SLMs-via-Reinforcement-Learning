                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is
 diffuse interstitial abnormality noted with relative areas of lucency
 superiorly and fibrotic changes in the mid lungs bilaterally.  Bilateral
 calcified granulomas are also identified.  Increased interstitial markings are
 seen at the bases.  There is no confluent consolidation nor effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted at the aortic arch.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings are suggestive of COPD and previous granulomatous disease.  No
 definite confluent consolidation although given increased interstitial
 opacities with lack of prior for comparison to document stability, acute
 process would be difficult to completely exclude.
