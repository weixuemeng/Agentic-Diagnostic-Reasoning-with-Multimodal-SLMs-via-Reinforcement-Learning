                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, brown phlegm. Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Frontal and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:   None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hypoinflated. No pleural effusion although slightly
 limited evaluation due to limited view of the right costophrenic angle on
 frontal projection. No pneumothorax. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila
 are unremarkable. Subtle increase in hyperdense area on lateral projection
 just superior to the a costophrenic angles.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits and visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite evidence of pneumonia.  A density on lateral view at posterior
 costophrenic sulcus is felt likely projectional.  However, recommend repeat
 radiography in short interval after resolution of symptoms to ensure
 resolution of this density.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression above was entered by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 21:40 into the Department of Radiology critical communications
 system for direct communication to the referring provider.
