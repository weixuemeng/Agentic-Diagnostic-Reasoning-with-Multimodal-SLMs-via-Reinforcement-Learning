                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness, currently on chemo for lung
 adenocarcinoma // please evaluate for infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear relatively unchanged allowing for differences in modalities with known
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy better seen on the previous CT.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Mild patchy atelectasis is noted in both lung
 bases without focal consolidation.  Bilateral scattered pulmonary nodules
 compatible with metastases are re- demonstrated, better appreciated on the
 previous CT.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Mild
 degenerative changes are present within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  Known mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy and pulmonary metastases are better visualized on the previous
 CT.
