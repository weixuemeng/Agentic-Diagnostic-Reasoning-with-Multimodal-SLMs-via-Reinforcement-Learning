                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p failed portacath placement  // eval PTX     
 .  REVIEW OF O PRIOR STUDIES INDICATES A HISTORY OF METASTATIC LUNG CANCER.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  CHEST X-RAY FROM ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, with rotated positioning.
 
 No central line is detected on the current study.  No obvious pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 slightly prominent.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated, similar prior. 
 There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, and a probable small left effusion.  Pleural
 fluid is seen tracking along the right chest wall into the right lung apex. 
 There is upper zone redistribution.  Allowing for low inspiratory volumes, no
 definite CHF, though thickening of the minor fissure is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax detected.  If there is high concern for a small pneumothorax,
 then a lateral view may help for further assessment.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small bilateral effusions. 
 Vascular plethora, without overt CHF.
