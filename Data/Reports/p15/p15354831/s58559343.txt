  In comparison to chest x-ray from ___, the cardiomediastinal
  silhouettes are stable.  There are low lung volumes and crowding of
  bronchovascular structures.  A right IJ central line is in unchanged position
  terminating in the right atrium.  Opacity at the left lung base may be
  minimally increased in comparison to prior radiograph, possibly representing
  more prominent atelectasis, however superimposed infection cannot be excluded
  in the proper clinical setting.  No definite pleural effusions are identified.
  There is no pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with New onset wheeze  // Assess for pulmonary
 edema, effusion, atelectasis      Assess for pulmonary edema, effusion,
 atelectasis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with some element of elevated pulmonary venous pressure and
 atelectatic changes and possible small effusion at the left base.  No evidence
 of acute focal pneumonia, though the area behind the heart is difficult to
 evaluate, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
 Right IJ catheter again extends into the right atrium.
