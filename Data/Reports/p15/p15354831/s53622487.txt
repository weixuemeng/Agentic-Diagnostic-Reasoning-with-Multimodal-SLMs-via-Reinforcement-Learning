                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with SOB and new renal failure  // ?PNA vs CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiograph demonstrate low lung volumes.  There
 is central vascular engorgement and cardiomegaly, the latter probably
 exaggerated by low lung volumes.  No focal opacity is identified.  No over
 pulmonary edema is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  No air under the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enlarged cardiac silhouette and central vascular engorgement likely
 accentuated by low lung volumes.  Superimposed pulmonary vascular congestion
 is possible.
