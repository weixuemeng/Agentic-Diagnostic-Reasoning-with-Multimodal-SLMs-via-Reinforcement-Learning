                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Leg swelling and shortness of breath, evaluate for CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 blunting of the posterior right costophrenic angle which may be due to a trace
 to a small right pleural effusion.  There are relatively low lung volumes. 
 There are a couple of scattered relative lateral opacities, which may relate
 to overlap of structures, although underlying pulmonary opacity due to
 infection is not excluded.  Very minimal pulmonary vascular congestion without
 overt pulmonary edema.  Left basilar atelectasis is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No pneumothorax is seen.
