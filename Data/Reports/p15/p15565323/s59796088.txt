                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with focal seizures, falls.  Evaluate for
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a diffuse bilateral interstitial thickening in both lungs,
 which might represent interstitial lung disease versus interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse interstitial thickening might represent interstitial lung
 disease, although interstitial pulmonary edema cannot be excluded. Comparison
 with prior study could be helpful to differentiate.
