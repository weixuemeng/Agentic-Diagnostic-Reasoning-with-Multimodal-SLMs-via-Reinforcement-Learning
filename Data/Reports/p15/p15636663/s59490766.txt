                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with dizziness and dyspnea, assess for acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are reasonably well expanded with unchanged moderate
 cardiomegaly and mild vascular congestion.  Mild interstitial edema may also
 be present, although similar to the prior study.  A more multifocal opacity
 seen in the right base is poorly assessed.  Consider repeat evaluation with PA
 and lateral views after patient is clinically able to delineate these findings
 further.
