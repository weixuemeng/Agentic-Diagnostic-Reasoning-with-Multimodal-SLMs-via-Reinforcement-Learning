                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The heart remains
 mildly enlarged.  There are low lung volumes, which likely result in
 bronchovascular crowding in the lower lungs.  There is mild vascular
 engorgement without frank pulmonary alveolar edema.  No large effusions are
 seen.  No pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contour is normal.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with probable mild interstitial edema.  Limited exam
 due to low lung volumes.
