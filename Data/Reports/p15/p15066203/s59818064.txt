                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/CP and SOB  // ___M w/CP and SOB
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 08:15.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left pectoral pacemaker defibrillator device intact and unchanged.  Bilateral
 lower lobe predominant opacities with air bronchograms are slightly worse even
 when accounting for interval decrease in lung volumes, likely reflecting
 development of moderate to severe edema in the setting of cardiomegaly and
 central pulmonary vascular prominence.  Concurrent multifocal pneumonia cannot
 be excluded.  No large pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Volume overload, however concurrent multifocal pneumonia cannot be excluded.
