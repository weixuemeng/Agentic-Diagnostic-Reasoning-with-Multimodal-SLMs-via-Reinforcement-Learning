                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with s/p drowning*** WARNING *** Multiple patients
 with same last name!  // thoracic pathology trauma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates diffuse opacities
 bilaterally, worse on the right than on the left, which may represent edema
 versus ARDS in the appropriate clinical context.  Possible small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  An endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina.  A
 transesophageal tube coils and terminates in the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Diffuse, bilateral opacities, worse on the right than on the left, in the
 appropriate clinical context, may represent asymmetric non-cardiogenic edema
 versus ARDS.
 2.  Transesophageal tube close and terminates in the stomach.  Pullback is
 recommended.
