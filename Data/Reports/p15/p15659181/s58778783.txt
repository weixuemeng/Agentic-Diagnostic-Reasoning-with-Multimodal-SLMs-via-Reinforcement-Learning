                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and wheezing.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is a new opacity in the right lower lobe concerning for pneumonia,
 superimposed on preexisting patchy medial right middle lobe opacification that
 appears more chronic, also comparing to ___, although the lungs
 had been clear on earlier radiographs from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing right basilar opacity worrisome for pneumonia. 
 Follow-up radiographs are recommended within eight weeks in order to ensure
 resolution.  If opacification were to persist, then chest CT should then be
 considered.
