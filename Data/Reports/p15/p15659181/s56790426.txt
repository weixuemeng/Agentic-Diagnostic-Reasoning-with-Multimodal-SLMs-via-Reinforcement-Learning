                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of left flank pain.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  Obscuration of the right heart border would ordinarily suggest right
 middle lobe pneumonia, but there is no corresponding abnormality on the
 lateral view, and lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Because the abnormal appearance of the right middle lobe is seen only on the
 frontal view, if clinical findings warrant suspicion of early pneumonia,
 follow up chest radiographs should be obtained.
