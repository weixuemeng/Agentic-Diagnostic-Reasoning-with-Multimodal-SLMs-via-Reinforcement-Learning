                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are slightly low, causing accentuation of the
 pulmonary vasculature and exaggeration of the heart size.  Persistent right
 middle lobe heterogeneous opacity is concerning for chronic aspiration,
 although pneumonia could have a similar appearance.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Likely chronic aspiration involving the right middle lobe
 although pneumonia could have a similar appearance.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiac or pulmonary process.
