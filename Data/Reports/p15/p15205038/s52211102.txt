 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with sepsis with new right internal jugular line.

 jugular venous catheter whose tip projects over the upper SVC.  There is no
 visualized pneumothorax on this film noting significant rotation.  Right lower
 lung consolidation is again seen but better characterized on previous exam
 suspicious for pneumonia.  Left lung is grossly clear.

 pneumothorax.  Persistent right lower lung consolidation compatible with
 pneumonia.
