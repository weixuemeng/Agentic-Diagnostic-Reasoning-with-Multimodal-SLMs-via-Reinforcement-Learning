 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lungs are low in volume but clear.  The heart is moderately enlarged but the
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Poor definition of one posterior
 pleural sulcus on the lateral view makes it hard to exclude small left pleural
 effusion.
 
 Air and fluid in the intestinal tract in the incompletely imaged upper abdomen
 suggests stasis.
