                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, hypoxia post Whipple's procedure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left PICC tip terminates in the SVC.  Low lung volumes are noted.  The cardiac
 silhouette size is unchanged and is mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains
 tortuous.  There is mild to moderate pulmonary edema, which appears progressed
 in the interval.  Small left pleural effusion is present.  Opacification in
 both lung bases likely reflects atelectasis though infection cannot be
 excluded.  Coronary artery stent is again demonstrated.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening pulmonary edema, mild to moderate in extent, with bibasilar
 opacities likely atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.  Please note
 that infection in the lung bases cannot be excluded.
