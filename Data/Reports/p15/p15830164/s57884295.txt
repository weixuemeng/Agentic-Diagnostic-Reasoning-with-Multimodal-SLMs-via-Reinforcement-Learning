 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged in this patient with
 intact midline wires following CABG procedure.  Mild indistinctness of
 pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure.  Bibasilar atelectatic changes are seen, especially on the left.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, this could possibly represent a developing
 consolidation.
