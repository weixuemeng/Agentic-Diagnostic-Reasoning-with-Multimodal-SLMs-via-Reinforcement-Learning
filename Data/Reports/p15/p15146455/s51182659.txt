                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A
 right-sided catheter courses over the right hemithorax, presumed a VP shunt. 
 There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular marking. 
 Given this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
