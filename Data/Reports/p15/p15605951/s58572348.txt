 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute respiratory failure, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes appear to
 have increased, likely caused by a decrease in extent of the bilateral pleural
 effusions.  However, the parenchymal opacities that preexisted are still
 clearly visible and present.  They have not substantially changed.  Unchanged
 status post intubation, pacemaker and right PICC line.  No pneumothorax.
