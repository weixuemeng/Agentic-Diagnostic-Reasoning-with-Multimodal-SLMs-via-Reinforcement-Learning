                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post right-sided thoracentesis.
 
 STUDY:  Portable semi-upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 5:34 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  A pacing lead projects over the left chest with leads in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The heart size is large but stable.  The
 mediastinal contours demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease of the
 aortic knob and a prominent pulmonary arterial contour.  The lungs demonstrate
 mildly improved but persistent pulmonary edema.  A pleural pigtail catheter is
 present at the right costophrenic angle with near-complete resolution of the
 previously described pleural effusion.  A small pleural effusion is still
 present on the left.  A right-sided PICC tip terminates at the mid SVC.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post right pleural pigtail catheter placement with
 improvement in pleural effusion and no pneumothorax; persisting pulmonary
 edema and small left pleural effusion.
