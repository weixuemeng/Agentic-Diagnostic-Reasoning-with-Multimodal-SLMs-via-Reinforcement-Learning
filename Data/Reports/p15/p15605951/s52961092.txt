                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC line, please evaluate placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest most recent ___.  Portable AP chest.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The right PICC line terminates in the mid SVC.  A left pacer has leads taking
 an expected course and terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. 
 Median sternotomy wires are well-aligned.  Lung volumes remain low.  The left
 lower lobe is consolidated from atelectasis or pneumonia.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Bilateral moderate pulmonary edema
 is worse.  The thoracic aorta is tortuous and calcified.  There is no
 pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. The right PICC terminates in the mid SVC.  
 
 2. Unchanged opacification of the left lower lobe is due to atelectasis or
 pneumonia.
 
 3. Moderate bilateral pulmonary edema, cardiac or otherwise, is worse.  Some
 of the radiographic worsening may be due to termination of positive pressure
 ventilation. 
 
 The position of the PICC was communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to
 ___ at 11:15 on ___ as requested.
