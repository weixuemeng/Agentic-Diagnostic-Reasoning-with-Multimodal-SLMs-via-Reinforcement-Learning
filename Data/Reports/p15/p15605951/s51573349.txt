                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine portable view of the chest.  Patient is rotated to
 the right.  The lungs are grossly clear with interval resolution of a
 previously seen pulmonary edema.  There is focal, likely pleural-based opacity
 projecting over the right lung base laterally, potentially due to loculated
 pleural fluid, especially given prior right-sided pleural catheter which is no
 longer visualized.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, noting a
 dual-lead pacing device.  Gaseous distention of the stomach is identified. 
 Degenerative changes seen at the shoulders bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolution of previously seen edema without definite acute
 cardiopulmonary process.  Possible loculated right basilar pleural effusion
 laterally.
