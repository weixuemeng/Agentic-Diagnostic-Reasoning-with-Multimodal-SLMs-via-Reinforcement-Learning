                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:52 A.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after intubation, question interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderately-severe pulmonary edema has worsened radiographically since ___, but whether this represents a parallel to real clinical changes would
 depend upon status of positive pressure ventilation.  Severe cardiomegaly is
 chronic.  Pleural effusions are presumed, but small.  Right PIC line ends in
 the mid-to-low SVC.  ET tube is in standard placement and an upper enteric
 tube ends in the upper stomach.  The transvenous right ventricular pacer lead
 follows the expected course, the right atrial lead denotes a very large right
 atrium.  No pneumothorax.
