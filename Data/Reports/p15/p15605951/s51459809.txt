                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Extensive diffuse bilateral opacities have minimally improved in the left
 lower lobe.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard position.  Pacemaker
 leads are in standard position.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Large bilateral pleural effusions are probably
 unchanged, better seen in prior CTs.
