                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known bronchiectasis on azithromycin with worsening cough and
 dyspnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___; chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes appear stable compared to the prior
 examination.  Again seen at the right costophrenic angle is some haziness
 which when corresponding to the prior radiograph and CT examination likely
 represents a prominence of mediastinal fat and post resection changes. 
 Adjacent changes are seen involving diminutive right lateral ribs which appear
 chronic.  Linear scarring or atelectasis is seen at the left base, similar or
 perhaps slightly worse than on the prior study.  No new consolidative process.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left retrocardiac atelectasis, similar or slightly worse than prior.  No
 definite consolidative process.  Overall very similar appearance of the chest
 when compared to the radiograph from ___.
 
 It is notable that the right upper lobe changes described on the prior CT from
 ___ were not particularly apparent on the radiograph on the preceding day,
 and therefore slight worsening of this process might not be evident on these
 radiographs.
