                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic ovarian cancer, question progression of pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 11:54 a.m.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen is a
 small right effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  There is
 also minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  Atelectasis at the left
 base has improved.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No CHF,
 focal infiltrate or effusion is identified. Previously seen colonic oral
 contrast is not longer visualized. Screws from the patient's left humeral
 fixation hardware are noted, though most of the hardware is excluded from this
 film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Small right effusion, essentially unchanged.  
 2) Interval improvement in left base atelectasis. Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is unchanged.
