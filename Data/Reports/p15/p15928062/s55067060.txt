                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ?aspiration pna on cta abd/pelvis  // assess
 for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior radiographs available.  Comparison is made to the CT
 scan of the abdomen and pelvis from earlier today
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Ill-defined patchy airspace opacities, most pronounced in the right lower lung
 zone may reflect the clustered centrilobular nodular opacities seen on the CT
 scan.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.  The size of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Ill-defined airspace opacities seen predominantly in the right lower lung zone
 likely correlates with what was seen on the CT scan and may be reflective of
 aspiration pneumonia.
