                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with AMS  // eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right upper lobe volume loss is responsible for marked elevation of the right
 hilus.  This could well be scarring, but should be evaluated by comparison to
 prior chest radiographs to see if there is any need to investigate possible
 bronchial obstruction.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal and left
 hilar silhouettes are normal.  There is no pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left upper lobe scarring and/or atelectasis, chronicity indeterminate.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consult prior radiographs to determine chronicity of right
 upper lobe volume loss.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___ by telephone
 on ___ at 10:13 AM, 2 minutes after discovery of the findings.
