                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with palpitations and subacute cough. 
 Evaluate for infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Spect CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hypoinflated which accounts for some bronchovascular
 crowding. No focal opacities are identified.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Incidentally noticed bilateral cervical ribs.  Low lung volumes account for
 bronchovascular crowding.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral cervical ribs incidentally noted.  Low lung volumes.
 Otherwise, unremarkable chest radiographic examination.
