                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:10 P.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 Right upper and perhaps right middle lobe collapse areound large central hilar
 mass, have increased relative to ___.  ___ in the right
 lower lobe is probably local dissemination of tumor.  Right main bronchus
 poorly defined, may be more narrowed than before.  New left perihilar
 abnormality could be vascular or lymphatic congestion, but when looking at the
 better inflated of two views performed, I see no pneumonia.  Heart size is
 normal.  No left pleural effusion.  There is probably a small right pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.
