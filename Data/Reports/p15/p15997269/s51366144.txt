                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea and known metastatic lung cancer. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates near-complete
 opacification of the right hemithorax consistent with complete right lung
 collapse around a large central hilar mass.  Again seen is probable narrowing
 of the right mainstem bronchus and persistent rightward shift of the
 mediastinum.  Interval increase in pulmonary congestion in the left lung.
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing into the stomach and out of the field of
 view. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Near-complete opacification of the entire right hemithorax consistent with
 right lung collapse around a known large central hilar mass.
 
 2.  Interval increase in pulmonary congestion in the left lung.
