                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Gangrenous cholecystitis and sepsis status post aggressive fluid
 resuscitation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Within the limitations of technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are probably within normal limits.  The lungs appear clear aside from
 minimal suspected right basilar atelectasis associated with a mildly elevated
 right hemidiaphragm.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No free
 air is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
