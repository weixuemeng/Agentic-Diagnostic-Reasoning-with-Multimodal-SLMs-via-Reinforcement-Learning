                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  Recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP view.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided PICC line terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  The
 heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  There is a similar opacity in the right
 lower lung obscuring the right hemidiaphragm.  It is difficult to exclude
 small pleural effusions, although there are no definite effusions. 
 Superimposed on the prior process is prominent indistinct pulmonary
 vascularity that is increased suggestive of a mild to moderate pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right-sided rib deformities
 appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right lower lung opacity worrisome for pneumonia. 
 Superimposed diffuse but predominantly central opacification, which is not
 entirely specific but most suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion.
