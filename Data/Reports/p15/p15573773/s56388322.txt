                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS: ___:
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath, cough, right PICC line.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Right-sided central line is seen with tip at the
 RA SVC junction.  Again noted are bibasilar regions of consolidation with more
 dense opacity in the lateral view seen posteriorly, potentially in the right
 lower lobe.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged
 but stable in configuration.  Bilateral proximal humeral hardware is again
 seen.  Multiple bilateral rib fractures are also noted as well as a mid
 thoracic dextroscoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities with more dense consolidation posteriorly,
 likely in the right lower lobe.  Findings may represent atelectasis, however,
 effusion or component of consolidation due to infection is also possible. 
 Please clinically correlate.
