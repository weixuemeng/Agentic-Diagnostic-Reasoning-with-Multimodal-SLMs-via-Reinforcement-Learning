                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath upon awaking today.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided central venous catheter which terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.  There is persistent right base opacity and likely
 atelectasis/scarring in the left lower lung.  Interstitial edema is again seen
 stable to possibly minimally improved.  The right costophrenic angle is not
 fully included on the frontal image and the right pleural effusion is
 difficult to entirely exclude.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  Partially imaged is hardware in the left humerus.
