                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there are diffuse areas of opacification bilaterally consistent
 with multifocal pneumonia.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 pulmonary vascular congestion is also seen.  Probable bilateral effusions with
 atelectatic changes at the bases as well.
