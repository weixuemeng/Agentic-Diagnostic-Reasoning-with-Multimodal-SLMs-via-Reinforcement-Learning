                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___ and
 chest CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The patient has chronic atelectasis in
 the lung bases as evidenced by chest CT from ___.  A rounded dense
 opacity in the right lung base corresponds with an area of rounded atelectasis
 on prior CT. The right-sided pleural effusion has increased in size, now
 moderate, where as aeration of the left lung base has improved.  No definite
 superimposed consolidation is identified.  A right-sided central venous
 catheter terminates in the expected location of the cavoatrial junction. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The heart size remains moderately enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable chronic bibasilar atelectasis with more focal rounded atelectasis
 in the right lung base.
 2.  Increasing right pleural effusion, now moderate.
 3.  No definite new superimposed consolidation.
 4.  Right central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction.
