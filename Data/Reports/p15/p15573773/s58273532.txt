                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with desaturation to low 80s.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal portable view of the chest was obtained.  The heart
 is enlarged and its right border is silhouetted by right lung base
 consolidation, which is increased since ___ and compatible with
 pneumonia, pleural effusion, or a combination of both.  The left lung is
 clear.  No pneumothorax is identified.  A right central catheter terminates in
 the low SVC.  Left humeral hardware is similar to prior and right humeral
 hardware is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lung base parenchymal opacity, increased since prior,
 compatible with pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  Probable
 superimposed right pleural effusion.
