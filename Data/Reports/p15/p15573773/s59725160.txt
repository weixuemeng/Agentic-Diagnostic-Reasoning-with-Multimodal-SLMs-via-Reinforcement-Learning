                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in patient with recurrent pneumonias,
 presenting with shortness of breath and low oxygen saturation, with a history
 of T1-T2 paraplegia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ dating back to
 ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  There is new heterogeneous opacification
 of the right lung base superimposed upon chronic atelectasis and fibrosis of
 the same area.  The left hemidiaphragmatic contour is also obscured, although
 this region of the radiograph is underpenetrated.  The upper lung fields are
 clear.  There is stable severe cardiomegaly.  A right PICC terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax.  The left costophrenic angle
 is not well visualized and a small effusion cannot be excluded.  Again noted
 is dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine as well as stable ribcage deformity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right middle and possibly lower lobe consolidation consistent with
 pneumonia.
 2.  Pneumonia involving the left lower lobe cannot be entirely excluded.
 2.  Stable severe cardiomegaly with a right-sided predominance.
