                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension and crackles at the left lung base.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Right-sided central venous catheter tip
 terminates at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged.  Previously noted
 nasogastric tube has been removed.  There is severe cardiomegaly, which is
 unchanged.  Mild perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness is compatible
 with mild pulmonary vascular congestion, slightly improved from the prior
 study.  Streaky ill-defined opacities at the lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is definitively noted. 
 Multiple bilateral old rib fractures are present.  Additionally, the patient
 is status post ORIF of a left proximal humeral fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, improved from the prior
 study.  Patchy opacities at the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis, though
 infection cannot be completely excluded.
