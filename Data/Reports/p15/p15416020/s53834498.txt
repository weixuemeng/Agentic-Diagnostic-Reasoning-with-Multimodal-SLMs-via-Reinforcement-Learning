                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PNA, intubated  // interval change in
 infiltrate      interval change in infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged.  Again there is enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and left pleural effusion. 
 Coalescent opacification at the right base would be concerning for
 superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Retrocardiac
 opacification on the left with silhouetting the hemidiaphragm could represent
 volume loss in the left lower lobe, though the possibility of superimposed
 pneumonia in this region must also be considered.
