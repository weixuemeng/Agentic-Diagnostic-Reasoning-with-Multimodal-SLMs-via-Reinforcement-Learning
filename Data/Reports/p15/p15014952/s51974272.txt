 HISTORY:  Cough and night sweats.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with some tortuosity of the aorta without vascular
 congestion or pleural effusion.  On the frontal view, there is asymmetry at
 the bases with some increased opacification on the left.  Although this is not
 confirmed on the lateral view, in view of the clinical history, the
 possibility of developing pneumonia must be seriously considered.
 
 This information was conveyed to Dr. ___.
