                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new diminished breath sounds R posterior
 base  // please assess for pneumonia/pleural effusion/hemidiaphragm elevation
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 New elevation of the right hemidiaphragm probably facilitates migration of a
 loop of large bowel above the liver, Chilaiditi's sign.  Atelectasis in the
 right middle lobe reflects elevated right hemidiaphragm.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New elevation of right hemidiaphragm suggests diaphragmatic dysfunction,
 including phrenic nerve paralysis.  Further evaluation by fluoroscopic sniff
 test or targeted ultrasound can be considered.
 2. No evidence of pneumonia.  No pleural effusion.
 Recommendations:
 Assess diaphragmatic function with fluoroscopy or ultrasound.
