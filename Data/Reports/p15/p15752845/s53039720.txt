                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with rectal cancer now with shortness of breath
 and cough  // does this patient have pneumonia or pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.  Targeted review of chest CT from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are multiple nodular densities seen throughout both lungs, the largest
 measuring approximately 22 mm, seen at the left lung base.  These are depicted
 in greater detail on the chest CT from ___.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  Low inspiratory volumes may contribute to
 accentuation of the cardiac silhouette.  There is upper zone redistribution,
 without overt CHF.
 
 There is subsegmental atelectasis at the left lung base and trace atelectasis
 at the right lung base.  No frank consolidation or gross effusion is
 identified.  Probable trace right pleural effusion.  Tiny left effusion cannot
 be excluded.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 There right-sided indwelling catheter is present, tip at SVC/RA junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules measuring up to 22 mm at the left base,
 better depicted on CT from ___.
 
 Upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.
 
 Subsegmental atelectasis at left and (minimal) at right lung base.  Trace
 right pleural effusion.
 
 No frank consolidation to suggest pneumonic infiltrate.  The possibility of an
 early pneumonic infiltrate at the left lung base cannot be entirely excluded,
 but is considered less likely.
