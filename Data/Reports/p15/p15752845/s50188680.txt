                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dyspnea, pleural effusions, severe MR  //
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable, and widespread pulmonary metastases are similar allowing for technical
 differences between the exams.  Small right pleural effusion has slightly
 increased in size with adjacent worsening atelectasis and increased elevation
 of right hemidiaphragm.  Linear left basilar atelectasis has improved in the
 interval and a small left pleural effusion has apparently decreased in size. 
 No other relevant change.
