                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of achalasia, presenting with flare of
 achalasia symptoms and increased secretions.  Question aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Evidence of a distended esophagus is seen
 with lucency projecting in the upper right paramediastinal region, likely
 representing air within the esophagus with some opacity seen more distally
 which may represent fluid within the esophagus.  No overt pulmonary edema is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of a dilated esophagus.  No focal consolidation.
