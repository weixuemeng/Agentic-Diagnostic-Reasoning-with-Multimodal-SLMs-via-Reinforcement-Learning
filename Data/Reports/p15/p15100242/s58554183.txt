                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, failed antibiotic treatment twice.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Ill-defined opacities within both
 lung bases are concerning for pneumonia or aspiration.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is clearly identified.  There are multilevel degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine.  Degenerative changes are also noted within the right
 shoulder with narrowing of the acromiohumeral interval suggestive of rotator
 cuff disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar pneumonia or aspiration.
