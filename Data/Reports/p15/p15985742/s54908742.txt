 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dyspnea on exertion  // ? heart failure;
 decreased sounds at bases crackles on right      ? heart failure; decreased
 sounds at bases crackles on right
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Hyperinflation reflects severe COPD.  Opacification at projecting over the
 lateral aspect of the right midlung could be peripheral consolidation due to
 active pneumonia.
 
 There is a 17 mm wide lobulated opacity projecting over anterior right second
 rib, which has been present, with a somewhat different morphology since at
 least ___.  There is extensive lobulation at the right lung apex which has
 grown more radiodense though not larger since ___.  If either of these
 lesions is due to tuberculosis or malignancy, the opacity in the right lung
 could be pleural thickening instead.  Chest CT scanning is recommended.  Left
 lung is grossly clear.  Heart size is normal.  No central adenopathy.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT to evaluate abnormalities described above
 including active pneumonia, reactivation tuberculosis and peripheral lung
 cancer.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Pertinent critical findings were posted by Dr. ___ on
