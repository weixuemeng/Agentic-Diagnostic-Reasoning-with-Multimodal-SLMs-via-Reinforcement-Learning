 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with high chest tube output s/p CABG  // Eval for
 increased effusion      Eval for increased effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the endotracheal tube
 has been removed.  The patient has taken a much better inspiration.  Left
 chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Specifically, there is no evidence of increased pleural effusion.  Continued
 obscuration of the medial portion of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with
 volume loss in the left lower lobe.
