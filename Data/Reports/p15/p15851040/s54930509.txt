                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, shortness of breath, AFib, crackles on exam. 
 Evaluate for evidence of fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___ as well as chest CT performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate severe cardiac
 enlargement which may be underestimated due to PA technique when compared to
 prior AP radiograph (which normally exaggerates cardiac silhouette slightly). 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Lung parenchyma demonstrates
 prominence of the interstitium in conjunction with mild bronchial wall
 cuffing, likely reflecting chronic underlying disease though element of mild
 edema is a consideration. An 11 mm nodular opacification in the left upper
 lung, correlating with FDG-avid lesion, is better assessed on recent chest CT.
 No pleural effusions or pneumothorax evident.  Multiple stable mild lower
 thoracic compression deformities present.  Sternotomy sutures are midline and
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild prominence of the interstitium in setting of cardiomegaly
 reflects mild fluid overload.  11 mm left upper lobe opacity corresponds with
 known mass.  No pleural effusions.
