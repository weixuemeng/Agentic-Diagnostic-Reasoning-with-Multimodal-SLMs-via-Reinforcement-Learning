                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hx diastolic CHF, cdif, Aortic stenosis,
 having ongoing dyspnea with exertion. Looking for fluid overload.  // Evidence
 of fluid overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged including cardiomegaly. Post
 sternotomy wires are stable. Interstitial opacities are slightly more
 pronounced than on the prior study.  And might reflect chronic interstitial
 edema. Nodular opacity seen on the previous examination in the left upper lung
 should be further assessed with chest CT to exclude the possibility of left
 upper lobe lesion.
