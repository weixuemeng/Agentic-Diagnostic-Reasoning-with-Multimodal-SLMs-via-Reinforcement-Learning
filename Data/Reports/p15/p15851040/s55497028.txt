                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is a mild diffuse interstitial
 abnormality with Kerley B lines, which are noted primarily at the right lung
 base.  This may reflect mild vascular congestion or a mild chronic
 interstitial abnormality could also be considered.  A nodular density
 projecting over the right lower lung is suggestive of a nipple shadow.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones appear demineralized.  Mild
 degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Mild interstitial abnormality which could be seen with mild vascular
 congestion versus chronic change.  These are difficult to distinguish since
 prior radiographs are not available.  
 
 2.  Nodular density projecting over the right lower lung suggesting a nipple
 shadow.  When clinically appropriate, however, confirmation of a nipple shadow
 as opposed to a pulmonary nodule is suggested by acquiring an additional PA
 view with nipple markers.
