                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and thrombocytopenia with hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is more prominent
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with indistinctness of engorged
 pulmonary vessels, consistent with worsening pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Some atelectatic component at the bases is probably present.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, possibility of superimposed infection would have
 to be seriously considered.
 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles is consistent with small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
