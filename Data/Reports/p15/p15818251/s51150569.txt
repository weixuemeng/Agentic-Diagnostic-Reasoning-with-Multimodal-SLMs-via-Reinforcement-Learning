                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which is unchanged
 from the prior study.  There is improved aeration of the bilateral lung bases
 from ___ with no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. 
 No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  There is diffuse
 mildly increased prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, which is improved
 from the prior radiograph.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is difficult to
 evaluate, but there is unchanged left ventricular configuration with probable
 mild-to-moderate cardiac enlargement.  The mediastinal contours remain
 prominent with unfolding of the thoracic aorta but appears stable in
 comparison to the prior study. Clips in the left neck are re-demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved aeration of the bilateral lung bases from ___ with
 no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 
 2.  Improved mild pulmonary vascular congestion without pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Stable cardiomegaly.
