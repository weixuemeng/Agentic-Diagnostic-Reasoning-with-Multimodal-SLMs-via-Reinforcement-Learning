                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 HISTORY:  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is difficult to evaluate, but there is suggestion of
 a left ventricular configuration and possibly mild-to-moderate cardiac
 enlargement.  There is mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 compared to the left, and lung volumes are low overall.  Patchy opacity
 obscures the left cardiac border and left costophrenic angle.  In addition,
 there is diffuse mildly increased prominence of the pulmonary vascularity,
 including indistinct upper zone redistribution.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax, although a small pleural effusion is difficult to
 exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity projecting over the left lower lateral chest,
 suggesting pneumonia in the appropriate setting; findings also suggestive of
 mild vascular congestion.
