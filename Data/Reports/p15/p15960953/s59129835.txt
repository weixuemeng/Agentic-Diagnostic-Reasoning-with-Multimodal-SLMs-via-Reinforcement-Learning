                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncopal episode, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  CT torso dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with resultant
 bronchovascular crowding.  Within this limitation, no large pleural effusion,
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 slightly prominent, most likely related to low lung volumes, but mild vascular
 engorgement could be present.  The cardiomediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is unchanged.  A compression
 fracture deformity at the upper lumbar spine is unchanged from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and possible minimal pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Unchanged compression fracture deformity of the upper lumbar
 spine from ___.
