                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M stage IIIA squamous cell ca LLL with completed neoadjuvant
 treatment s/p decortication and open LLL lobectomy with mediastinal
 lymphadenectomy  // eval for ptx     eval for ptx
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs most recently ___.
 
 Lung volumes are generally lower, heart size is greater, and pulmonary
 vasculature more engorged following left thoracotomy, reflecting mild cardiac
 decompensation or volume overload.
 
 Greater opacification at the base of the left lung, is presumably atelectasis
 or pleural effusion.  There is no appreciable pneumothorax, with an apical
 pleural drainage tube in place but there is new subcutaneous emphysema along
 the left chest wall.
