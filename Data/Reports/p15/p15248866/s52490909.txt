                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F found down by roommate with head injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is within the proximal right mainstem bronchus.  An
 enteric tube is cold within the esophagus with distal aspect terminating in
 the distal esophagus.  Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the
 size of the cardiac silhouette which appears mildly enlarged.  Widening of the
 superior mediastinal contour may be due to low lung volumes and supine
 positioning.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present with possible
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no overt pulmonary edema. Atelectasis
 is noted in the lung bases.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified
 on this supine exam.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right mainstem bronchial intubation.
 2. Coiled enteric tube within the esophagus, with tip in the distal esophagus.
 3. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and possible mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Right mainstem bronchial intubation finding was discussed by
 Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the telephone on ___ at 10:33 AM.
