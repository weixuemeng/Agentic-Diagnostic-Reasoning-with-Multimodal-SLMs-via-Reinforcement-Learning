                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F w/LLL opacity, wide mediastinum, although earlier film from
 today rotated, please perform repeat, unrotated film this AM  // ___F w/LLL
 opacity, wide mediastinum, although earlier film from today rotated, please
 perform repeat, unrotated film this AM
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine radiograph of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  There is a persistent left lower lobe opacities
 silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
 as before.
 Likely small left pleural effusion.
 Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
 Endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic inlet, enteric tube tip
 terminates in the gastric fundus and EKG leads overlie the chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube tip terminates at the thoracic inlet.  As recommended
 earlier the tip could be advanced by about 2 cm.
 2. The lung volumes remain low with unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis and
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
 3. The widened appearance of the mediastinum is likely secondary to the low
 lung volumes and poor inspiratory effort.
