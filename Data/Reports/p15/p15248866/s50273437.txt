                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fevers  // ?pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest single view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 05:14
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip in good position.  Enteric tube tip in the proximal
 stomach, side hole near gastroesophageal junction, should be advanced. 
 Right-sided venous catheter tip near cavoatrial junction.  Mild to moderate
 left pleural effusion, probably similar allowing for difference in patient
 positioning.  .  Improved left perihilar opacity.  Stable left basilar
 consolidation, likely atelectasis.  Stable right basilar opacities.  Probable
 trace right pleural effusion.  Heart size, pulmonary vascularity has mildly
 improved, partially secondary to improved inspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 atelectasis; pneumonitis cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
