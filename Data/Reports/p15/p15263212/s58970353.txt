                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Follow up right lower lobe opacity.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS THE CHEST:  The previously seen opacity at the right
 lung base, presumably pleural fluid, has resolved.  There is no focal airspace
 consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart
 is normal size.  The hilar structures are unchanged.
