                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with a cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Upper pole of the left hilus is slightly
 more radiodense than expected, but this could be normal.  Any prior chest
 radiographs should be obtained to see if this is a new finding warranting
 further investigation.  If symptoms persist, repeat PA and lateral chest
 radiograph should be obtained in no more than four weeks, to see if additional
 imaging is warranted at that time.  Heart size is top normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  Aorta and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 Dr. ___ was telephoned as requested.
