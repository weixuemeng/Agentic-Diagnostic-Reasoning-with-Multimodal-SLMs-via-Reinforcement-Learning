                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoglycemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle left
 basilar opacity likely represents atelectasis.  No definite focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is some
 degenerative change at the left shoulder joint with heterotopic ossification
 seen just inferior to the glenohumeral joint/possible loose body; however,
 this is not dedicated imaging of the shoulder.
