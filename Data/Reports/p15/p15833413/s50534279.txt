                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with multiple myeloma status post SCT.  Recent
 oxygen requirement.  Rule out pneumonia, edema or effusions.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest again demonstrate a diffuse
 reticular nodular pattern throughout both lungs.  There is also a component of
 pulmonary vascular congestion which suggests some fluid overload.  This has
 not improved since the prior radiograph of ___.  This finding
 could be due in part to widespread micronodular pattern demonstrated on recent
 chest CT from ___ but could also represent a concurrent infectious
 process in the appropriate clinical setting.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged.  There is no evidence of pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  
 
 CONCLUSION:  Diffuse reticular nodular pattern and some fluid overload. 
 Although this could be due to widespread micronodulation demonstrated on
 recent CT, an infection may also be present.  No interval improvement since
 the prior radiograph.
