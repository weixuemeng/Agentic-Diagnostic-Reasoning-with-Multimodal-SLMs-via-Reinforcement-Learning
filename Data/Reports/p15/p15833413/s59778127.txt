                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fevers, cough, hypotension.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph a prominent right upper mediastal
 contour without loss of right paratracheal stripe, likely due to mediastinal
 vessels. Heart size is normal. Faint opacifications are noted in bilateral
 lower lungs with air brochograms in the retrocardiac space likely representing
 atelectasis, but infectious process is a consideration.   No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacifications; in absence of strong concern for
 pneumonia, likely represent atelectasis.
