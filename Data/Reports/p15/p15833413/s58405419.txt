                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough x1 month.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  Just superior to the right minor fissure is a focal opacity,
 likely within the anterior segment of the right upper lobe.  There is also a
 focal opacity overlying the left heart border, likely within the lingula. 
 There may also be more diffuse reticular opacities throughout the lungs. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A wedge compression deformity
 of the L1 vertebral body is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Multifocal opacities in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe and
 lingula, as well as potentially more diffuse reticular opacities, concerning
 for infection.  Followup chest radiograph 4 weeks after treatment, and if
 there is no resolution of these opacities then CT chest, is recommended.  
 
 The findings were entered into the critical communication dashboard by Dr.
 ___ at 16:56 on ___.
