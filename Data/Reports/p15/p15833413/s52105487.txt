                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST ___, ___, 6:22 P.M.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with new hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 There has been a substantial increase in the perfusion of abnormality in the
 lungs, some of it exaggerated by lower lung volumes.  While it is possible
 that this represents mild edema, since the upper lobe and mediastinal
 vasculature are engorged, it could be due in part to an increase in widespread
 micro-nodulation demonstrated on torso on chest CT scans, ___ and ___ respectively.  In that vein, a new bulge in the mediastinal contour
 could be due to progression of mediastinal adenopathy in the aortopulmonic
 window seen on those examinations.
 
 Heart size is top normal.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 9:30 a.m., at the time these findings were
 recognized. Findings were discussed with another house officer who answered a
 subsequent page at 10:30AM.
