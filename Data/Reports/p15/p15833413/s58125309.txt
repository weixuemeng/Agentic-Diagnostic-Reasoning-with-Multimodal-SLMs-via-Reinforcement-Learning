                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A
 right-sided PICC is again seen, terminating at the distal SVC/cavoatrial
 junction.  There are low lung volumes.  There are slight increased
 reticulonodular markings bilaterally, which could in part relate to low lung
 volumes, although underlying atypical infection or slight fluid overload may
 be present.  These findings appear slightly more pronounced as compared to the
 prior study.  Reticulonodular opacities were present on prior studies
 ___ ___ and ___.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
