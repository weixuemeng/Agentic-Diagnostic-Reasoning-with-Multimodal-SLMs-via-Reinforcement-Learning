                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:
 Hypoxia.  Right mid line.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of a PICC line terminates over the right axilla.  The lung volumes are
 low. Allowing for differences in technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable. There are probably pleural effusions of moderate size,
 although not well characterized, in addition to confluent opacities at the
 lung bases, greater on the left than right. There is mild pulmonary
 congestion, but not as severe as on the prior exam. Findings are little if at
 all change compared to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar findings suggesting mild pulmonary edema, moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions, and extensive basilar opacities, greater on the left than right,
 atelectasis versus pneumonia.
