                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the left subclavian PICC line
 appears to have been pulled back so that it is in the brachiocephalic vein. 
 The lung volumes have slightly improved, though there is dense opacification
 in the retrocardiac area with blunting of the costophrenic angle.  This most
 likely reflects substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe with small
 pleural effusions.
 
 No definite vascular congestion.
