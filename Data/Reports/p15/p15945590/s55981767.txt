                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with acute shortness of breath with prior CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Relatively low lung volumes are seen.
 There are indistinct pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of a component of
 interstitial edema.  Bibasilar opacities seen suggestive of atelectasis given
 low lung volumes versus developing infection.  Incidental note is made of an
 azygos lobe and fissure.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Osseous
 structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings suggestive of mild interstitial edema.  Bibasilar opacities
 potentially due to atelectasis given the low lung volumes although
 superimposed infection is also possible.
