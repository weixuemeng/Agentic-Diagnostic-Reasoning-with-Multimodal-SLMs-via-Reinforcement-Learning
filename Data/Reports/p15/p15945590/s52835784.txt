                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 09:39
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CHF, new oxygen requirement, admitted
 with pneumonia, now with chest pain, question edema, question effusion.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 13:53.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 09:39 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stably enlarged.  Main pulmonary
 artery again is enlarged consistent with known underlying pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  There is persistent stable mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and
 more focal airspace consolidation is seen at the left base which may represent
 compressive atelectasis in the setting of layering effusion, although
 pneumonia should also be considered.  Patchy opacity at the right medial lung
 base likely reflects atelectasis and is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Overall, when compared to the most recent prior study of ___, there is
 increasing consolidation at the left base, but there is otherwise no
 significant interval change.
