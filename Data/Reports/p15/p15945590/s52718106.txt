                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 The patient is intubated.  An endotracheal tube terminates about 8 cm above
 the carina.  The portion with the balloon is not well visualized, lying
 superior to the films.  A dialysis catheter terminates in the uppermost right
 atrium. A right-sided PICC line is been removed. The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged including marked enlargement of the main
 pulmonary artery contour. Incidental note is made of an azygos fissure, a
 common normal variant.  There is mild opacification in the retrocardiac area
 but markedly decreased.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear. Small pleural
 effusions are likely but also markedly decreased.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Persistent left basilar opacity but markedly decreased.  Although active
 infection is not excluded, this appearance could be explained by resolving
 atelectasis or recent prior infection.
 
 2. Status post endotracheal intubation with high-lying endotracheal tube, not
 fully visualized including its balloon.  Advancing the tube by several cm may
 be appropriate.
