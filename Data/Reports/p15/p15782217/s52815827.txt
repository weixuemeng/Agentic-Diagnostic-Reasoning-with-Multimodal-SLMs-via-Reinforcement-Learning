 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT 15:13
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with productive cough.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The heart remains stably enlarged, likely reflecting cardiomegaly.  The
 interstitium remains slightly prominent, reflecting age-related changes or
 small airways disease.  No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest
 pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.  There is deformity of the left lateral rib cage, likely
 reflecting remote trauma.  In addition, there is evidence of vertebroplasty of
 one of the lower thoracic vertebrae.  No acute bony abnormality is
 appreciated.  The aorta remains unfolded and tortuous.
