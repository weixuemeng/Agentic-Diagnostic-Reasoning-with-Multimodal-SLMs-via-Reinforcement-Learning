                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with worsening severe AS  // interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:42
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Allowing for differences in technique, I doubt significant interval change. 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly, with upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis, without frank consolidation.  Possible minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle which, if real, is new.  Old healed
 left sided rib fractures again noted.
 
 Irregular density overlying a compressed vertebral body in the region of the
 thoracolumbar junction is compatible with vertebroplasty with extruded cement,
 better visualized on CT from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Equivocal minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  Otherwise, I
 doubt significant interval change.
