                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable allowing
 for differences in technique.  There is a vague rounded opacity projecting
 over the right lower lung, not clearly visualized on the recent prior study,
 although this may be due to differences in orientation of image acquisition. 
 Peribronchial cuffing and interstitial thickening could be seen with mild
 vascular congestion or possibly other conditions such as airway inflammation
 or atypical infection.  Regarding the focal right lower lung opacity, one
 concern is a possible mass.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Mild interstitial abnormality, new since the prior study.  Correlation
 with clinical findings is suggested.  The findings would be compatible with
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  
 
 2.  Focal right lower lung opacity, vague and possible new over the short
 interval, but somewhat rounded, suggesting infectious consolidation versus
 mass.  Depending on clinical circumstances, if infection is suspected, then
 short-term follow-up radiographs, preferably with standard PA and lateral
 technique, if possible, are recommended, and otherwise short-term chest CT.
