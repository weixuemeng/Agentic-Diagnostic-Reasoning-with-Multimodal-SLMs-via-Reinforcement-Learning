                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pain crisis  // ? signs of acute chest
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs on ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction as before.  The heart
 is mildly enlarged but stable in size from the prior radiograph given
 differences in inspiration.  Lung volumes are low which accentuates
 bronchovascular markings.  A subtle peripheral right lower lobe opacity
 partially obscures the peripheral right hemidiaphragm and appears more
 prominent than on the ___ chest radiograph.  There is no effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nonspecific peripheral right lower lobe opacity, which could be due to an
 early focus of pneumonia, atelectasis, or potentially acute chest syndrome.
