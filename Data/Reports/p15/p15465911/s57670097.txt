                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for acute chest syndrome or other intrapulmonary process
 in a patient with sickle cell and presenting with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate a left chest port with
 the tip terminating in the low SVC.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains
 mildly enlarged.  There is no focal consolidation or evidence of acute chest
 syndrome.  Mild peribronchial infiltration is similar to multiple prior exams,
 and likely residue of recent edema or early developing edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild peribronchial opacification, similar to multiple prior exams, is likely
 residue of recent edema or early developing edema.  No focal consolidation or
 evidence of acute chest syndrome.
