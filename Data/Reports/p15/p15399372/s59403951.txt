                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___. 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with increased respiratory rate, fall earlier
 today.  Question pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from earlier the same day at ___.  The lungs remain clear.  There is no
 effusion, pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged.  Severe
 degenerative changes noted at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally.  Anterior
 wedging of the lower thoracic vertebral body versus upper lumbar vertebral
 body is age indeterminate and clinical correlation is recommended.  Surgical
 clips project over the right axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Wedge deformity of a
 lower thoracic/upper lumbar vertebral body could be old; however, clinical
 correlation is suggested.
