                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of cirrhosis secondary ___'s
 disease, now presenting with acute shortness of breath and worsening ascites.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is elevation of the bilateral
 hemidiaphragms likely secondary to the acute intra-abdominal process.  The
 lungs appear clear.  No confluent opacities are identified.  There is no
 pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is evident. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Opacified
 loops of colon are seen below both hemidiaphragms.  Additional mildly
 distended loops of small bowel overlie the midline epigastrium.  If there is
 concern for obstruction, dedicated abdominal radiographs are recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
