                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Back pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Thoracic cage is grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Note that radiography is relatively insensitive for
 evaluation of osteomyelitis/ discitis and if there is high clinical concern,
 MR should be obtained.
