                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MSSA bacteremia, loculated pleural effusions
 s/p trach and R chest tube. Eval for chest tube placement and interval change.
 // ___ year old man with MSSA bacteremia, loculated pleural effusions s/p trach
 and R chest tube. Eval for chest tube placement and interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs most recent on on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy is unchanged position. A right pigtail catheter overlies the
 right hemi thorax in largely unchanged position.  A right-sided PICC
 terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low. Bilateral airspace opacities are again
 demonstrated and not significantly changed from the prior examination. 
 Obscuration of the left costophrenic angle is increased from the prior
 examination consistent with a small to moderate left layering left pleural
 effusion.  Small right loculated effusion is stable. Retrocardiac opacity may
 represent some areas of atelectasis or consolidation. Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as above.
 
 Multi focal opacities seen throughout both lungs are not significantly changed
 from the prior examination. A left pleural effusion may be minimally increased
 from the prior exam.
