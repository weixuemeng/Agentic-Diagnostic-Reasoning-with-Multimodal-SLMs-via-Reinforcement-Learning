                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall and left rib pain  // eval rib fractures
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications
 at the knob.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Minimal linear opacities within the lung
 bases, more pronounced on the left, likely reflect areas of subsegmental
 atelectasis.  A small left pleural effusion is likely present.  There is no
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  There are mild degenerative changes
 noted in the thoracic spine.  No definite displaced rib fracture noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis with small left pleural effusion.  No
 definite displaced rib fractures are identified.  If there is continued
 concern for a rib fracture, recommend a dedicated rib series.
