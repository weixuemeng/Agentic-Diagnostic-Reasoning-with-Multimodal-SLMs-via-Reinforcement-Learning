                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, patient with pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.
 Left lung base consolidation, better appreciated on the lateral view is
 unchanged.  Parenchymal changes involving the right lung base are more
 conspicuous since prior.  There is no pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart size is normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No significant change in left basal consolidation.  Parenchymal
 changes in the right lung base are more conspicuous since prior.  The above
 findings are most compatible with infection.  Please see CT Chest findings of
 the same date for more detail.
