                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patchy left
 base opacity is seen, which could be due to atelectasis, although underlying
 infectious process may be present in the appropriate clinical setting.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen.  No right base atelectasis.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left base opacity worrisome for pneumonia.  Recommend followup to
 resolution.
