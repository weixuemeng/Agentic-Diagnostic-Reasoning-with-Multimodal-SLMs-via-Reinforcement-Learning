                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are areas of increased
 opacification at the bases, especially on the left.  However, this is not
 definitely confirmed on the lateral projection.  Nevertheless, if there is
 strong clinical suspicion for developing pneumonia, this could be supported by
 the imaging findings.
