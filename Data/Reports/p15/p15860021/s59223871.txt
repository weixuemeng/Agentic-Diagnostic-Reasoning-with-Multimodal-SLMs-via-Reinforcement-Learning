                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is subtle opacity in the right lower lobe which maybe due to
 atelectasis and low lung volumes versus pneumonia in the correct clinical
 setting.  Left lower lobe opacity is likely a prominent epicardial fat pad. 
 Retrocardiac area remains clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 or pulmonary edema.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle right lower lobe opacities which may reflect pneumonia in
 the correct clinical setting, alternatively atelectasis.
