                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung volumes without
 pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  The hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  A 9-mm ovoid density, likely calcified projecting over right
 lung apex, may represent a calcified granuloma.  Prominent air-filled loops of
 bowel with air-fluid levels are noted in imaged upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  A 9-mm opacity projecting over right lung apex may represent calcified
 granuloma, but other pulmonary nodule not excluded; chest CT would provide
 better evaluation/characterization.
 
 3.  Air-filled loops of bowel with air-fluid levels are noted in the imaged
 upper abdomen, not fully evaluated.  Correlate clinically and consider
 additional imaging as warranted.
