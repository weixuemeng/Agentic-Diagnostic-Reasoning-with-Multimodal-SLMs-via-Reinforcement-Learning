                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ EtOH and HCC s/p OLT ___ w/ post-op course complicated
 by HA thrombosis s/p failed revision   thrombectomy. Multiple admissions
 post-op, w/ recurrent leg and scrotal edema at home  // Evaluate for interval
 change of pleural effusions. Please perform at 06:30 on ___. Thanks.
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST X-RAY FROM ___ AT 16 20
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with 1 day earlier, the  cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again noted, similar to prior.
 
 Prominence of the right hilum and surrounding perihilar region appears
 slightly more pronounced.  This is not fully characterized, but the
 differential diagnosis includes a pneumonic infiltrate.   There is new subtle
 hazy opacity at the right lung base, question due to the increased
 atelectasis.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora equivocally
 increased.
 
 No gross effusion.  Small effusions seen posteriorly on the lateral view from
 the prior study would likely not be well demonstrated on this AP examination.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New hazy opacity at the right base, question increasing atelectasis.
 2. Known small effusions are not well depicted on this AP view.
 3. Right perihilar opacity, question related to pneumonia, is very slightly
 more pronounced.
 4. Upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora is similar, question
 slightly more pronounced.
