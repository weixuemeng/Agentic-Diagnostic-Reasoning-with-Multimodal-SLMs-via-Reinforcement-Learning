                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.
 
 The lungs are clear of confluent consolidation.  Costophrenic angles are
 sharp.  As on prior, there is a calcified density projecting over the anterior
 right first rib for which apical lordotic views could help further localize
 within the chest versus within the rib.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. 
 Multiple air-fluid levels identified in the upper abdomen without free
 intraperitoneal air.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute intracranial process.
 2.  Calcific density projecting over the right third rib for which apical
 lordotic views may help further characterize.
 3.  Multiple air-fluid levels identified below the diaphragm for which
 clinical correlation is recommended and additional imaging if clinically
 desired.
