 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:04 AM
  Since the prior exam, there has been a slight interval worsening of moderate
  pulmonary edema. A more focal opacity at the right base may be a component of
  this worsening of edema, though an early pneumonia or aspiration is a
  possibility.  Attention on follow-up radiographs is recommended. No definite
  pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. The right PICC
  tip is in the upper to mid SVC. The tip of the NG tube is in the stomach.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with agitation, tachypnea  // Evidence of
 infiltrate?      Evidence of infiltrate?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened, and coalescent edema probably explains
 slight increase in consolidation in the right lower lobe.  Mild cardiomegaly
 is stable. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not of substantial volume.
 
 Right PIC line ends in the upper SVC and an esophageal tube ends in the upper
 portion of a nondistended stomach. No pneumothorax.
