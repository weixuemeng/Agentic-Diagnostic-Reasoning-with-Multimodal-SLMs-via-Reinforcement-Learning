 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest

 approximately 3 cm.
 There are low lung volumes. Did bilateral perihilar opacity is likely due to
 mild edema. Left-sided parahilar opacities asymmetric as compared to the
 right, which could be due to asymmetric edema however, underlying aspiration
 or infection not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The
 cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged, likely accentuated by
 supine, AP technique.
