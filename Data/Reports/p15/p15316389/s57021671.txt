                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post intubation.  Evaluate tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest.  The left most
 margin of the chest, along with the left costophrenic angle, are not imaged.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned, no less than 4.3 cm above
 the carina.  A nasogastric tube courses through the esophagus and into the
 expected location of the stomach.  The sideport may be near the
 gastroesophageal junction  The there are median sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal surgical clips.  The lung volumes are low.  Bilateral perihilar
 opacities and bronchial cuffing are consistent with pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  The there is no pneumothorax.  The there is a convex, sharply
 demarcated, rounded opacity in the lower left chest of unclear etiology,
 possibly an elevated hemidiaphragm.  There are likely small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube. The nasogastric tube could be
 advanced to ensure the sideport is in the stomach.
 
 2. Central pulmonary vascular engorgement. Likely small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 
 3. Convex opacity in the left lower chest of unclear etiology, possibly
 elevated hemidiaphragm.  This area is incompletely imaged.  Consider repeating
 the radiograph when the patient is able.
