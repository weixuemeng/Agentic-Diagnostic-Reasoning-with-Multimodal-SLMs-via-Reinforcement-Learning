                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lethargy with altered mental status, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is a
 catheter traversing the right hemithorax which is unchanged and may represent
 a VP shunt catheter.  There is left basilar atelectasis with mild elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm, unchanged.  No new opacity to suggest pneumonia. 
 Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size appears grossly stable and within
 normal limits.  The mediastinal contour is normal.  The imaged osseous
 structures appear intact.  A calcific density is again seen projecting
 inferior to the right coracoid process.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No convincing signs of pneumonia.
