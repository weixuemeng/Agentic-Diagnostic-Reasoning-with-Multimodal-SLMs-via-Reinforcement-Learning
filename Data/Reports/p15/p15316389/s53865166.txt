                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known subarachnoid hemorrhage with tracheostomy tube.  Evaluate
 NG tube position.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-erect AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tracheostomy tube is in satisfactory position with the tip
 approximately 4.2 cm from the carina.  A left subclavian central venous
 catheter is in unchanged position.  A nasogastric tube courses below the
 diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view.  Sternal wires are intact.
 
 Since the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower, which accentuates the
 bronchovascular structures.  Moderate elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with
 associated atelectasis is stable.  A new left perihilar and lower lung zone
 opacity is present.  There is no overt pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactory position of the multiple support devices.
 2.  New left perihilar and lower lung zone opacity, which may represent
 atelectasis, though in the proper clinical setting could be due to a new
 pneumonia or aspiration.
 
 Results were text paged to the covering neurosurgery NP ___ at 5:45
 PM on ___ via telephone by Dr. ___ ___ minutes after the findings were
 discovered.
