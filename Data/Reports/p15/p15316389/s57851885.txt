                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position.
 Interval removal of right subclavian catheter with no visible pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance, and there remains
 moderate elevation of left hemidiaphragm with adjacent basilar opacity which
 likely reflects atelectasis.  New linear atelectasis has developed at the
 right lung base, with otherwise no relevant changes since the recent study of
 two days earlier.
