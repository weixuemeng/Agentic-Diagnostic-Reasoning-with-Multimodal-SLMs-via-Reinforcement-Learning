                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left lateral chest wall pain.  Assess for pneumothorax or
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heterogeneous left lower lobe opacities were better evaluated on
 recent chest CTA from ___, likely atelectasis versus early
 infarction given multiple pulmonary emboli seen on prior CT. These opacities
 have not changed significantly compared to the CT, which was performed
 approximately 20 minutes earlier.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart
 size is top normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Heterogeneous left lower lung opacities, likely atelectasis
 versus early infarction, better evaluated on recent CT from ___. 
 Of note, multiple left lower lobe pulmonary emboli were seen on recent CT.
