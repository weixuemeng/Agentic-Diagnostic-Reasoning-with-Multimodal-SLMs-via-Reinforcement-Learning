                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with decompensated heart failure, leukocytosis 
 // evaluate for infiltrate, interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, pulmonary edema has decreased
 in severity.  An asymmetrical area of airspace opacification remains in the
 right apex.  Although possibly due to resolving asymmetrical edema, infectious
 pneumonia should be considered in the setting of leukocytosis.  Moderate left
 and small right pleural effusions are again demonstrated.
