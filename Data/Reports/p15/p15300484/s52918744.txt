                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post left lower lobectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the post-operative opacity
 at the left lung base shows an expected course.  The rounded consolidation at
 the lower aspect of the left hilus is well delineated and homogeneous.  The
 lung volumes have overall increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. 
 No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
