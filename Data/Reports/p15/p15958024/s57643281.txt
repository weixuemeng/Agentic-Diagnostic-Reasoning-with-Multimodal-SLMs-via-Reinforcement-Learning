                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A pacemaker generator overlies the left
 chest wall.  The leads appear intact throughout their course, terminating in
 the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle.  The atrial
 lead continues to follow the path of a suspected duplicated SVC.  There is
 stable increased density in the left lung base, findings suggestive of a
 moderate pleural effusion with underlying consolidation.  Findings could
 reflect compressive atelectasis, though pneumonia is also within the
 differential.  The left upper lobe and right lung appear clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No vascular congestion or edema is evident. Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette
 is limited by the left basilar consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable left basilar consolidation.  Atelectasis and pneumonia are
 within the differential with a probable overlying moderate effusion.
