                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension, cough.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Numerous prior chest radiographs, most recent ___,
 ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest.  Left chest wall
 pacemaker-defibrillator has a lead traversing the right SVC terminating in the
 right ventricle and another lead arriving in the right atrium by way of a left
 sided SVC draining into the coronary vein.  Lungs are normally expanded.  
 
 There is blunting and opacity at the left costophrenic sulcus which may
 represent atelectasis, possibly with small pleural effusion, although
 infection cannot be completely excluded. However, this area is partially
 obscured by the pacer.  The remaining lung fields are clear. There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable; the heart is top
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Progression of what is likely atelectasis at the left base,
 although infection cannot be completely excluded. This could be better
 evaluated with formal PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
