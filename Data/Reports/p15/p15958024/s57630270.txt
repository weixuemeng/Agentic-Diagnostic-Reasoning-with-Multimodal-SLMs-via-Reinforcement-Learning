  There has been an interval increase in asymmetric opacification overlying the
  left hemi thorax, as well as a left basilar consolidation. There has also been
  an interval increase in a small left-sided pleural effusion. Although this may
  be secondary to asymmetric pulmonary edema, worsening left-sided atelectasis/
  pneumonia is of concern. No pneumothorax.
