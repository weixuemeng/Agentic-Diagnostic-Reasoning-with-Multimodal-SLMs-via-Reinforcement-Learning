                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Elevated BNP, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Again seen is a left-sided pacemaker
 device, with one lead coursing through a left-sided SVC terminating in the
 right atrium, and a second lead terminating in the right ventricle, coursing
 through the right-sided SVC.  The heart size is moderately enlarged, and the
 aorta remains mildly tortuous.  There is new left basilar opacity with
 adjacent small to moderate sized left pleural effusion, new from the prior
 study.  Right lung remains clear, and there is no pneumothorax.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left basilar opacification, possibly representing
 atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded, with new small to moderate
 sized left pleural effusion.
