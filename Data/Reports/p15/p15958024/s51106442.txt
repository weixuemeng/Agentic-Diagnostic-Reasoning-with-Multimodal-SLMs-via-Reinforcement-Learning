                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post left thoracentesis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier the same day at 10:38.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided dialysis catheter enters the right atrium. A left pectoral AICD
 remains in place with lead placement reflecting variant anatomy, including a
 persistent left SVC. The layering left pleural effusion has decreased, and is
 now small.  Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. There is no
 pneumothorax. Unchanged retrocardiac opacification is due to unchanged left
 lower lobe collapse. The right lung remains clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval decrease in left pleural effusion, which is now small. Unchanged
 small right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Unchanged left lower lobe
 collapse.
