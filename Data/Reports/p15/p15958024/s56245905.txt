 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Dual-lead AICD is
 unchanged in position.  There are subtle opacities noted in the lower lungs
 which most likely reflect atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart and mediastinal contour is
 stable.  Bony structures are intact.
