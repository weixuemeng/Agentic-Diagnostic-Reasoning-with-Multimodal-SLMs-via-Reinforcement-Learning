                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with bilateral lower extremity swelling, dyspnea
 on exertion, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Again noted is a left-sided pacemaker
 device with one lead coursing through a left-sided SVC and terminating in the
 right atrium, a second lead terminating in the right ventricle, coursing
 through the right-sided SVC.  The heart size is moderately enlarged.  The
 aorta is tortuous.  There is again noted is left basilar opacity.  The right
 lung remains clear, although there is minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle which may suggest trace right pleural effusion.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left pleural effusion, slightly smaller, with probably underling
 atelectasis; however, underlying infectious process cannot be completely
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
