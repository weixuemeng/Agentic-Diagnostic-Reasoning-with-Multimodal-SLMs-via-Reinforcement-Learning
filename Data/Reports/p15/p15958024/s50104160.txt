                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right ventricle lead extraction via left subclavian and
 reimplantation of right via the right axillary vein, here to evaluate lead
 position and evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pectoral pacemaker re-demonstrates leads terminating in the
 right atrium and right ventricle with a modified course of the right
 ventricular lead consistent with recent intervention.  The left lead courses
 through a persistent left SVC through the coronary sinus into the right
 atrium.  There is no definitive evidence of pneumothorax.  However, there is a
 small left pleural effusion, which is new from the prior study with a left
 lower lobe consolidation.  There is no right pleural effusion.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No definitive evidence of pneumothorax.
 2.  New small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe consolidation. 
 Recommend clinical correlation to exclude pneumonia.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were communicated by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 12:45 p.m. on ___.
