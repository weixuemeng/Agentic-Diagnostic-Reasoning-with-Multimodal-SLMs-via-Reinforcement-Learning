  Left sided pacemaker-defibrillator with leads terminanting in expected
  locations of right atrium and right ventricle. Modified course of RV lead
  seems to correlate with provided history and recent  intervention. Evaluation
  of the right lung base limited by overlying hand. No large pneumothorax
  identified, although limited in this supine radiograph.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lead extraction.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the left pacemaker leads
 terminate in the expected locations of the right atrium and right ventricle. 
 Modified course of the right ventricular lead is consistent with the recent
 intervention.
 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.  The lungs are essentially clear, though the
 right base is obscured by an overlying hand.
