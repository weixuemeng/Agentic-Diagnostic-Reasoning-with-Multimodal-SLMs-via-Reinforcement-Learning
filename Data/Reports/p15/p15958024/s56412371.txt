                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 There is no appreciable reaccumulation of left pleural effusion.  Minimal
 volume of fluid or pleural scarring explains blunting of the pleural sulci. 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable.  A trans-subclavian
 right atrial pacemaker traverses left-sided SVC and coronary sinus, while the
 adjoining transsubclavian right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead traverses
 the SVC.
