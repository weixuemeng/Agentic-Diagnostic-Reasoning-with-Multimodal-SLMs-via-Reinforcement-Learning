                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension, leukocytosis, question infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 A pacemaker is present.   The battery pack and lower left chest wall are
 excluded from the film.  The appearance of the leads is smilar to the ___
 CXR.    A right IJ central line is present, tip over proximal-most SVC.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 There is cardiomegaly with prominence of the mediastinum, probably with an
 unfolded aorta.  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular
 blurring, which could reflect CHF.  There is patchy opacity with obscuration
 of the left hemidiaphragm, progressed compared with ___, consistent with
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Subtle patchy opacity in the
 right mid/upper zone, new compared with ___. Possible minimal blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Progressive left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  The
 differential diagnosis includes a pneumonic infiltrate.
 2.  Upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse blurring could reflect an
 element of CHF.
 3.  Hazy opacity right mid/upper zone, ? early confluent CHF or pneumonic
 infiltrate.
