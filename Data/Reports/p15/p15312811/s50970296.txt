                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hemoptysis, right chest pain, and weight
 loss  // mass lesion or other cause of hemoptysis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  No priors available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a mildly tortuous thoracic aorta. Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are normal. The bilateral hila are normal.
 
 Projecting over the left upper lung, there is a 5 mm circular possibly
 calcified opacity, which may represent bony island or left upper lobe lung
 nodule, possibly an old calcified granuloma ; specific localization is limited
 given lack of alternative views. It is recommended to obtain any old chest
 x-rays if this is not a known finding, or to obtain apical lordotic views if
 there are no prior films.
 
 Otherwise, there are no focal lung consolidations.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left apical circular opacity, possibly calcified. ___ represent rib bony
 island versus lung nodule, possibly old calcified granuloma. Recommend
 obtaining old radiographs or apical lordotic views if not previously known.
 Otherwise no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr.
 ___ ___ the phone on ___ at 10:50, approximately 30 minutes
 after discovery.
