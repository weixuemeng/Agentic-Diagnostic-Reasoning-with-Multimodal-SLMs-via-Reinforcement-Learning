                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in pneumomediastinum in patient with
 renal failure status post traumatic intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ dating back to ___.
 CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate interval
 resolution of pulmonary edema from the mid and upper lung field when compared
 to the study from three days ago.  There are persistent bilateral lower lung
 opacities representing residual edema and/or atelectasis.  Small pleural
 effusions are also present.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are
 normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no evidence of residual
 pneumomediastinum.  A right subclavian hemodialysis catheter has been placed
 and terminates at the expected location of the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval improvement in pulmonary edema with some persistence in the
 bilateral lung bases.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
 3.  No evidence of pneumomediastinum.
