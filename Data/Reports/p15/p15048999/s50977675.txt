                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with pneumonia, evaluate interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates interval
 withdrawal of an endotracheal tube which is now seen within the mid trachea,
 4.5 cm from the carina.  Lung volumes are low, with slight interval increase
 in bibasilar atelectasis and retrocardiac opacity.  Bilateral effusions are
 small, if any.  Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous gas in the shoulder girdle
 and up the neck demonstrates interval resorption.  An NG tube is in place with
 its tip and sidehole within the stomach.  There is mild pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Resolving pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous gas in the shoulder girdle
 and neck.
 3.  Retrocardiac and bilateral infrahilar opacity can be explained by
 atelectasis, although aspiration or pnuemonia is not excluded.
