                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dchf, copd, afib, new sob and hypoxemia 
 // cause of sob
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR from___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ and allowing for considerable differences in
 positioning, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 Suspect background hyperinflation/COPD.
 
 Again seen is marked cardiomegaly, vascular plethora and mild vascular
 blurring, consistent with CHF.  Obscuration of both costophrenic angles is
 again present,  suggestive of small bilateral effusions.
 
 Increased retrocardiac density and opacity at the right lung base likely
 represents a combination of collapse and/or consolidation and pleural
 effusions.  Both hemidiaphragms are obscured.
 
 Right paratracheal/paramediastinal opacity is again seen, not fully
 characterized.
 
 Curvilinear opacity extending across the upper chest into both axillae is
 thought to represent artifact due to overlying soft tissues.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Doubt significant interval change.
 2. Marked cardiomegaly.
 3. CHF with evidence for interstitial edema and likely bilateral pleural
 effusions
 4. Bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation.
 5. Persistent right paramediastinal opacity, similar to the prior film, not
 fully characterized.  If clinically indicated, chest CTA could help for
 further assessment.
