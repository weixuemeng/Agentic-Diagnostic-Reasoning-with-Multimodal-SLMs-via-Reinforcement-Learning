                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxemia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting COPD.  In addition, there is prominent
 kyphosis of the thoracic spine.  There is moderate to moderately severe
 cardiomegaly.  Fullness of the contour of the main pulmonary artery suggests
 pulmonary hypertension.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt
 CHF. There is atelectasis at both bases and blunting of both costophrenic
 angles.  
 
 Compared with ___, pleural effusions are new and the bibasilar atelectasis
 is more pronounced.  Possibility of an early pneumonic infiltrate cannot be
 excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable mild CHF.  Small effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Early infiltrate cannot be excluded.
