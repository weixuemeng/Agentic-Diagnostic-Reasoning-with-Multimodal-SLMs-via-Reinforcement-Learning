 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, chronic heart failure, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the malpositioned PICC line
 on the right has been removed.  The venous introduction sheath positioned in
 the right internal jugular vein remains in unchanged position.  There is
 unchanged evidence of moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly, the shape of the
 cardiac silhouette could suggest the presence of pericardial effusion.  This
 could be confirmed or rule out with echocardiography.  The extent of the
 pre-existing bilateral pleural effusions remains constant.  Also constant is
 the appearance of the lung parenchyma, with atelectatic changes at the lung
 bases but without evidence of pneumonia in the well-ventilated lung portions.
