                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilaterally there is moderate perihilar congestion and hazy interstitial
 abnormality most suggestive of pulmonary edema. There are also more focal
 posterior basilar opacities, at least including the retrocardiac region,
 possibly pneumonia in the left lower lobe.  Fissures are thickened. A
 subpulmonic effusion is difficult to exclude on the right.  There is no
 evidence for pleural effusion on the left. A metallic fragment projects over
 soft tissues of the left axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Suspicion for coinciding
 opacity in the left lower lobe concerning for pneumonia.
