                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fevers, change in mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are reduced compared to the previous exam.  Heart size remains
 borderline enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities are
 noted within the lung bases, more pronounced on the left, which may reflect
 areas of atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be completely
 excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Bullet shaped
 radiopaque foreign body is noted within the left axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  Infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
