                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size but stable
 compared to the prior exam.  Tortuosity of thoracic aorta also appears
 unchanged.  Lungs remain clear, and there are no pleural effusions or acute
 skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest radiographic findings with no abnormalities to
 suggest the presence of a primary lung cancer.  However, if clinical suspicion
 persists, a diagnostic chest CT may be considered as it is more sensitive than
 radiographs for this diagnosis.
