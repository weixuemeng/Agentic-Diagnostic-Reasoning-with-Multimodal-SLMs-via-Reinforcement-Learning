 HISTORY:  Left shoulder pain.

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with a left ventricular
 predominance is re- demonstrated.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable
 with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  The hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities visualized.  Clips are seen in the right upper quadrant
 of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  No fracture identified, but if there is
 continued clinical concern, dedicated left shoulder radiographs are
 recommended.
