                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 lower inspiration, which may account for some of the increase in the
 transverse diameter of the heart.  Nevertheless, there is engorgement of
 ill-defined pulmonary vessels, consistent with developing pulmonary venous
 congestion.  There is mild basilar atelectasis without definite focal
 pneumonia.
