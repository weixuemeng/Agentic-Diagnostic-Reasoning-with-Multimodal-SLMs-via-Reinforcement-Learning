                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath and desaturation,
 assess for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate-to-large left and large right pleural effusions are
 similar in distribution to the previous examination with an apical cap on the
 right side.  This obscures the cardiac silhouette.  
 
 Even with this background there appears to be increased opacity at the left
 base which could reflect an aspiration event given the provided clinical
 history.
