                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Rapid deterioration of respiratory status after chest
 tube removal.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The study is limited since apices were not included in the field of view.  No
 definitive pneumothorax or increase in pleural effusion has been demonstrated.
 Substantial calcifications of the anterior mediastinum are redemonstrated. 
 Post-radiation changes in the paramediastinal area bilaterally are noted as
 well as substantial volume loss in the upper lobes.
