                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___, there is increased opacity at the left lung base, with
 interval obscuration of left hemidiaphragm, likely reflecting an effusion with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Extensive opacification of
 the right lung is similar, possibly slightly improved at the right base.  No
 pneumothorax identified.  The visualized portions of the left and right upper
 lungs show no CHF.
