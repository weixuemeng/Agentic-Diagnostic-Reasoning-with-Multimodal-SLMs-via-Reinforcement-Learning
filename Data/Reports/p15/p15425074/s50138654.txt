                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of bilateral mastectomies for
 breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, status post XRT and thyroid irradiation
 thyroidectomy with history of pulmonary fibrosis and aortic stenosis, has one
 month of anorexia, reflux and vomiting.  Assess for pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views of the chest were obtained.  Upper lobe linear opacities
 and associated right apical pleural thickening is unchanged from multiple
 previous examinations and likely reflects post-treatment changes.  New
 blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus may reflect pleural thickening or
 small pleural effusion without associated parenchymal opacity.  The left lung
 is well aerated.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Heart is normal in size with
 calcifications in the left mediastinum, unchanged from the previous CT. 
 Degenerative changes are seen of both shoulders with intra-articular body seen
 in the right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable post-treatment changes with trace new right pleural
 effusion versus pleural thickening but no findings of pneumonia.
