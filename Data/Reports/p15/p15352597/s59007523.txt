                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Polytrauma with multiple rib fractures and small pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 Prior pneumothorax on the left has resolved.  Multiple recent left-sided rib
 fractures and healed right-sided rib fractures are again noted.  There is
 increased opacity at the left base, projecting medially on the PA view and
 posteriorly on the lateral view, with associated inferior hilar retraction
 compatible with volume loss.  This thus likely represents a combination of
 significant left lower lobe atelectasis with a degree of left pleural fluid,
 though the relative contributions of these two processes to the current
 findings is difficult to discern.  The right lung is well aerated and clear. 
 There is no evidence of pneumonia.  Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged, accounting for inferior displacement of the left hilus. 
 Postoperative changes are noted in the left shoulder, incompletely evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Multiple left-sided rib fractures again noted, though there has been
 resolution of prior left pneumothorax.  
 
 Significant increase in left lower lobe volume loss, likely with a degree of
 left pleural fluid.
