                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ESRD on PD, s/p L SFA PTA ___, p/w L ___ toe
 wet gangrene, s/p L ___ toe amputation (Pods) left open, febrile o/n  //
 evaluate for consolidation, effusion, etc
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There are no focal
 consolidations, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema. There are no
 pneumothoraces.  There is air seen adjacent to the left hemidiaphragm on the
 AP and lateral views. This is likely within the stomach. If there is high
 concern for free intra-abdominal gas, would recommend dedicated upright
 abdominal films or CT scan.
