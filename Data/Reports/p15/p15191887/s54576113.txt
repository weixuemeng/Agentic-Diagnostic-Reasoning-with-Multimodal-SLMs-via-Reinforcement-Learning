                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with recent fatigue, bleeding, bruising, dyspnea now with low
 WBC/ANC/plt, high blasts  // ?lymph nodes, mass, other acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates clear lungs bilaterally.  No
 focal consolidation convincing for pneumonia is present.  Heart size is
 normal.  Best appreciated on the lateral image, there is equivocal soft tissue
 density in the retrosternal region which may reflect prominent outflow tract
 or soft tissue in the prevascular space.  There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or evidence of pulmonary edema.  Imaged osseous structures and
 upper abdomen are without an acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Equivocal soft tissue density in the retrosternal region which may reflect
 prominent outflow tract or alternatively soft tissue in the prevascular space.
 Chest CT could further assess.
