                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post Pleurx catheter placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 10:11 today and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A right Pleurx catheter is present with its tip directed
 inferomedially.  The right subpulmonic pneumothorax and pleural effsuion are
 unchanged allowing for differences in inspiration.  A small pleural effusion
 remains.  Extensive subcutaneous air along the right chest and airspace
 opacities within the right lung are postoperative.  The known right lung mass
 is unchanged.  The left lung is clear.  The cardiomediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  A calcified tortuous aorta is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right pleural effusion and pneumothorax likely without significant
 interval change given differences in inspiration and patient position.
