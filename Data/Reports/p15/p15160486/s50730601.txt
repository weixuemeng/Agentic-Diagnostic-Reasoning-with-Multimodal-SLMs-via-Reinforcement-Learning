                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is a large bulging opacity in the posterior lower right hemithorax which
 suggests a large loculated pleural effusion.  A more free flowing portion of
 the effusion has also increased more anteriorly with possible patchy
 coinciding atelectasis.  A suspicious nodule persists in the right upper lung.
 Possibly a right upper lung nodule has increased, but change could be better
 appreciated by comparing with CT if needed.  The left lung remains clear with
 no effusion.  The bones are probably demineralized to some extent.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of a large recurrent partly loculated
 effusion in the right lower hemithorax.  Suspicious nodule in the right upper
 lobe, potentially increased somewhat.
