                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion status post thoracentesis and tube placement. 
 Evaluation for reaccumulation of effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent radiograph dated
 ___ and correlation with CT chest dated ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the prior examination, there has been interval
 decrease in right-sided pleural effusion.  A drainage catheter at the right
 base remains in position.  No new focal consolidation is seen.  A previously
 seen nodule in the right mid lung, measuring at least 3 cm is unchanged to
 minimally improved.  The heart size is top normal.  There is dense
 calcification and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  There are severe
 bilateral degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular and glenohumeral
 joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval drainage of right pleural effusion.  A persistent nodule
 which appears fissural on prior CT examinations could represent loculated
 fluid (pseudotumor) or solid lesion.  Though this lesion had increased in size
 on the prior two studies, this increase could be due to the recent effusion. 
 After complete drainage of effusion, a repeat CT could be performed to see if
 the lesion has returned to its previous size.
