 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:46 PM
  Again seen is a right Pleurx catheter with the tip located inferomedially. 
  The right subpulmonic pneumothorax has not enlarged since the prior study. 
  There is now fluid likely within the pleural space consistent with
  hydropneumothorax.  The the known right lung mass is unchanged.  Left lung
  remains clear.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with stage IV lung cancer and malignant
 pleural effusion, evaluate a small subpulmonic pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to ___ at ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right Pleurx catheter again is seen at the base with the tip located
 inferomedially.  The right subpulmonic pneumothorax is unchanged if not
 slightly smaller.  There is a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema laterally
 on the right.  Overall, the right mid and lower lung opacity is stable, part
 of which represents a known lung mass.  There is a stable right apical and
 lateral pleural thickening which could reflect pleural fluid, chronic pleural
 thickening and/or pleural metastasis.  Left lung remains grossly clear but
 hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema.  The aorta is calcified
 consistent with atherosclerosis.  Overall, heart is unchanged in size. 
 Degenerative changes of the right acromioclavicular and right glenohumeral
 joint.  No acute bony abnormality appreciated.
