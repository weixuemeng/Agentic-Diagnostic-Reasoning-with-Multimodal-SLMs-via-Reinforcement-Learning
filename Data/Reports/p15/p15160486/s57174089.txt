                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right pleural effusion status post Pleurx catheter placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.  CTA chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable frontal chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS: A right Pleurx catheter has been placed in the interim with the tip
 directed inferomedially.  Increased airspace opacities of the right lower lung
 are thought to reflect postprocedure changes.  Additionally, subcutaneous
 emphysema is present.  A small right pleural effusion persists.  There is a
 right subpulmonic pneumothorax.  A nodule seen in the right mid lung measures
 2.2 cm and is largely unchanged from prior studies.  The left lung is clear. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  Dense calcifications are seen
 throughout the aorta. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Right subpulmonic pneumothorax after Pleurx catheter placement.
