                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o male with gastrointestinal bleed.  Tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited due to positioning. Allowing for this limitation, there
 is no significant change compared with the recent exam performed ___ min prior.
 The esophageal tube ends below the GE junction, with the tip out of view.  The
 tube is radiopaque, probably from contrast material within the tube or from
 tube change with a tube with radiodense walls.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Radiopaque esophageal tube ends below the GE junction, with the tip out of
 view.
 
 2.  Unchanged mild widening of the upper mediastinum as previously mentioned
 may be related to positioning.  Trumatic injury to the mediastinum or
 brachiocephalic vasculature should be considered.  Attention on follow up is
 recommended.  Chest CT could be performed for further assessment if clinically
 indicated.
