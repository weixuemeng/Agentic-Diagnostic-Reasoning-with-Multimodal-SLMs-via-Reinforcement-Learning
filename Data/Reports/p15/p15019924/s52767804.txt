                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with recent placemt of a venous line and intubated.  Assess
 for position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited due to positioning. Allowing for this limitation, there
 is no pulmonary opacity or consolidation. No pleural effusion is identified.
 The heart is not enlarged.  Apparent widening of the superior mediastinum is
 noted.
 
 An endotracheal tube ends 6.7 cm above the carina. An esophageal tube ends
 below the gastroesophageal junction, with the side port within the stomach. A
 left-sided venous line ends at the level of the left sternoclavicular joint.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No pulmonary parenchymal opacity or pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Widening of the upper mediastinum. Attention on follow up is recommended. 
 Chest CT could also be performed for further assessment if clinically
 indicated.
 
 3.  Monitoring and supporting devices as described above.
