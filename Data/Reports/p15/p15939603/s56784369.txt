 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___.
 
 Previous central adenopathy has improved, but persists in at least the left
 hilus and probably right lower paratracheal station.  Lungs are clear.  Heart
 size normal.  No pleural abnormality.
 
 The line traversing the right jugular vein ending close to or just beyond the
 tricuspid valve is presumably a temporary pacer lead.  The adequacy of this
 location should be assessed clinically.
