 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Streaky left
 retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
