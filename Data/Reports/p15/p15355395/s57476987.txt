                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Confusion, weakness, and recent falls.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device has leads terminating in the right atrium and
 ventricle, respectively.  The heart is normal in size.  The right upper
 mediastinal border has a smooth convex appearance which is usually due to
 tortuosity of the great vessels.  A moderate hiatal hernia is distended with
 air.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.  The lungs appear clear. The right humeral head appears
 somewhat low-lying compared to the glenoid although this may be due an
 artifact of how the film was acquired.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease or injury.  Hyperinflation. 
 Moderate hiatal hernia.  Possible laxity or subluxation of the right
 glenohumeral joint, although commonly this type appearance is an artifact of
 positioning. Correlation with physical examination of the shoulder is
 recommended.
