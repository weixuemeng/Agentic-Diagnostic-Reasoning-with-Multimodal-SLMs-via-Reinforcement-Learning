                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with mediastinitis, respiratory dysfunction //
 evaluate for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ PA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided chest tube and mediastinal drains are unchanged. A right-sided
 PICC line has been retracted, and now terminates at the junction of the right
 subclavian vein and SVC. Lung volumes are low. Bibasilar subsegmental
 atelectasis with left lower lobe collapse is unchanged. There is also likely a
 small layering left pleural effusion. Cardiomegaly despite the projection is
 stable. Retrocardiac opacification is likely due to atelectasis. Lower right
 rib fractures re-demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The only appreciable interval change is slight retraction of the right-sided
 PICC line, which now terminates at the junction of the right subclavian vein
 and SVC.  To reposition the catheter within the lower SVC, advancement by at
 least 6-7 cm is advised.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___
 telephone on ___ at 9:41 AM, 10 minutes after discovery of the findings.
