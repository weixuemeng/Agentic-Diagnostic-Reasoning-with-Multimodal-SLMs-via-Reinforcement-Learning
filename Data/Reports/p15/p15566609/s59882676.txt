 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph performed yesterday afternoon, the patient has been

 line terminates in the right axillary vein. There is a millimetric right
 apical pneumothorax, not significantly changed compared to yesterday's study. 
 There is no pneumothorax on the left.  There are bibasilar opacities, which
 may be due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains enlarged.  A right-sided 7th rib fracture
 is re- demonstrated.

 1.  Stable millimetric right apical pneumothorax.
 2.  Previously malpositioned right PICC line now terminates in the right
 axillary vein.
