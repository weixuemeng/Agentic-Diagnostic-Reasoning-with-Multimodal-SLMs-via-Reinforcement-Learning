                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post motor vehicle collision with upper back

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 thoracic spine abnormal density.  2 lower thoracic vertebral bodies are
 ill-defined anteriorly with loss of the intervertebral disc space.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Suggestion of hiatal hernia on frontal radiograph, which is not confirmed on
 lateral radiograph and may be sliding or represent aortic or paraspinal
 density.  2 ill-defined lower thoracic vertebral bodies with loss of the
 intervertebral disc space.  CT is recommended.
