                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Myocardial infarction with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Minimal patchy
 opacity is noted within the right mid lung field, and an area of developing
 infection cannot be excluded.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There is no pulmonary edema.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity within the right mid lung field.  This could
 represent an area of developing infection, and clinical correlation is
 recommended.
