                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Immunosuppressive therapy with CHF and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion.  This
 discordancy raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or even pericardial
 effusion.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles may reflect pleural thickening.
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia in this patient with intact midline
 sternal wires.
