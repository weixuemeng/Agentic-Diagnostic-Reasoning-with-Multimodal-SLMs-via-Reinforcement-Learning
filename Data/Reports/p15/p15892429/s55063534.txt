                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and weight gain.  Recent hospitalization for
 pneumonia but also history of renal transplant, congestive heart failure, and
 coronary bypass.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear not significantly changed.  Vague patchy opacity in the lingula has
 resolved, although there is now patchy opacity obscuring the left
 hemidiaphragm, probably due to minor atelectasis.  Diaphragms are flattened
 suggesting hyperinflation.  This examination shows mild interstitial
 abnormality including prominent upper zone redistribution of pulmonary
 vascularity suggesting mild vascular congestion.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings with mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and
 cardiomegaly.
