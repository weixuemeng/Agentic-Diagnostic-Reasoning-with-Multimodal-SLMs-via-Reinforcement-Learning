                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A double-lumen central venous catheter has been removed and
 instead, a stent passing along the distal left brachiocephalic and mid upper
 portions of the superior vena cava is observed.  Surgical clips project over
 the right upper quadrant.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no
 pneumothorax.  The lateral view suggests perhaps a trace pleural effusion on
 the right.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspected trace right-sided pleural effusion.  Central venous
 stent.
