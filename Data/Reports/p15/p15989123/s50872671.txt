                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumomediastinum, evaluation for interval change. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies with the most recent chest radiograph from
 the same day.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again noted is extensive subcutaneous air, similar to that seen previously. 
 Pneumomediastinum appears relatively stable.  Right apical pneumothorax is
 minimally smaller.  Right middle lobe segmental collapse has increased in
 comparison to the prior study. There is now also increase opacification of the
 lingula.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right apical pneumothorax is minimally smaller.  Stable pneumomediastinum
 and subcutaneous air.
 
 2.  New New lingular opacification which may represent atelectasis. Concurrent
 infectious process must be excluded in the proper clinical setting. 
 
 3.  Increased right middle lobe partial collapse.
