                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Known right pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs and CT torso dated ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Interval increase in the size of a right apical pneumothorax, now measuring up
 to 2.4 cm and without evidence of tension physiology.  Redemonstrated is
 significant pneumomediastinum and diffuse subcutaneous emphysema, essentially
 unchanged as compared to the prior examination.  Airspace opacity obscuring
 the right heart border likely correlates with the known right middle lobe
 collapse seen on recent chest CT.  Left basilar airspace opacities may
 represent atelectasis versus consolidation.  A small right pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No acute bony
 abnormality is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased size of a right apical pneumothorax measuring 2.4 cm.  No
 definite evidence of tension.
 2.  Unchanged, severe pneumomediastinum and diffuse subcutaneous emphysema. 
 
 3.  Left basilar atelectasis versus consolidation.  
 
 4.  Right middle lobe collapse. 
 
 5.  Small right pleural effusion.  
 
 Findings were conveyed by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 9:25 on
 ___, ___ min after discovery.
