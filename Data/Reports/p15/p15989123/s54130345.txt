                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 08:46.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again, there
 is extensive subcutaneous emphysema.  Pneumomediastinum is again seen.  Small
 right apical pneumothorax appears minimally increased when compared to the
 prior study.  No interval findings to suggest tension are seen.  There is
 persistent right middle lobe opacity, which likely relates to known right
 middle lobe collapse seen on CT.  Right pleural effusion was better assessed
 on CT.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right apical pneumothorax appears minimally increased as compared
 to the prior study.  No definite signs of tension.  These findings were
 discussed with Dr. ___ at 4 p.m. on ___ via telephone. 
 Persistent pneumomediastinum, extensive subcutaneous emphysema.  Right middle
 lobe opacity most likely relates to right middle lobe collapse, although
 underlying infection at that location is not excluded.
