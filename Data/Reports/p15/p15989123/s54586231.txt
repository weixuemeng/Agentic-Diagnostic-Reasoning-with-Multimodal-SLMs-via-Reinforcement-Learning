                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known pneumomediastinum, here to evaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema involving the entire chest and
 lower neck is unchanged.  Evaluation of the lungs is limited due to linear
 opacities from subcutaneous air collections.  Within this limitation, a small
 right apical pneumothorax likely persists.  Pleural fluid is small in amount,
 if any.  There is increased opacification of the the right lung base, likely
 reflecting collapse.  The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.
 Extensive pneumomediastinum is not significantly changed from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent tiny right apical pneumothorax.
 2.  No significant change in pneumomediastinum.
 3.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema, similar to prior exam.
