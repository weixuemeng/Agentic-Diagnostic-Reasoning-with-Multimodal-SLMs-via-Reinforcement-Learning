                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  Question pneumothorax at outside hospital.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  Linear lucency along
 the left side of the mediastinum and within the mediastinum superiorly is
 compatible with pneumomediastinum.  Extensive subcutaneous gas extends into
 the neck and right greater than left chest wall.  There is no definite
 pneumothorax identified on either side, noting that trace apical pneumothorax
 could be obscured by overlying subcutaneous emphysema.  The lungs are clear of
 focal consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pneumomediastinum and extensive subcutaneous gas.  No visualized
 pneumothorax.
