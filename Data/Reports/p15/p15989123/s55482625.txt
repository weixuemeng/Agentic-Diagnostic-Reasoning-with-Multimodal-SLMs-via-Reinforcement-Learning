                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known pneumomediastinum, here to evaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day at 02:59 a.m. and
 previously on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema throughout the thorax and lower
 neck is unchanged and limits evaluation of the underlying lung.  Within this
 limitation, a small right apical pneumothorax remains visible.  The patient's
 known pneumomediastinum is not significantly changed from prior studies. 
 Opacification of the right middle lobe is unchanged, reflecting a component of
 collapse.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours appear within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent small right apical pneumothorax.
 2.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum, similar to prior
 studies.
