                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  Biventricular pacemaker.  Evaluate lead position and look for
 complications.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 There has been no interval change, and there is no evidence of cardiac
 decompensation or complications.  Heart is moderately too severely enlarged,
 but pulmonary vasculature is not particularly engorged and there is no edema
 or pleural effusion.  Nor is there mediastinal widening or pneumothorax. 
 Atrio-biventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses from the left
 pectoral pacemaker.
