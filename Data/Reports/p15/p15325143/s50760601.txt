                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with trauma while intoxicated and lip laceration
 and missing teeth. Evaluate for tooth aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated, accounting for bronchovascular crowding. No focal
 opacities are identified. An apparent spine sign on the lateral view is likely
 related to left hemidiaphragm eventration. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. No
 radiopaque foreign object is seen in the airways to suggest aspiration.
 Deformity of the left clavicle is related to old fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  No aspirated foreign body seen.
