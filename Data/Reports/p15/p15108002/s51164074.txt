                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and cough, assess for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The Impression of this study on the preliminary review was, "No
 acute intrathoracic process." The final interpretation by the attending
 radiologist is as follows:
 
 The lateral view suggests a nodule projected over the ascending thoracic aorta
 with no clear corresponding finding on the frontal view.  The study is
 otherwise normal.  Unless the patient's clinical condition dictates attention
 sooner, I would recommend a repeat examination in four weeks, with review by
 the radiologist before the patient leaves the Radiology Department to see if
 additional views, such as shallow lateral obliques, are needed.
 
 The ED QA Nurses have been notified by email of this change from the
 preliminary reading.
