                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 17:17
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with aortic dissection status post
 exploratory laparotomy.  Evaluate for intrathoracic process, question fluid
 overload.
 
 Comparison to ___ at ___.
 
 A portable erect chest film ___ at 17:17 is submitted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in mid SVC.  Lung volumes
 remain low with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and associated patchy
 opacity likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis.  The interstitium
 also appears slightly more prominent than on previous studies which when
 correlated with a recent CT study of ___ could reflect mild interstitial
 edema or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No pneumothorax.
