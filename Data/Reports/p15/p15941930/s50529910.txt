                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confirm lead placement for dual-chamber pacemaker.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate a
 right-sided chest wall pacemaker with two leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  These are unchanged in position, accounting for
 differences in technique, to the prior radiograph.  No other relevant change
 is noted within the lung parenchyma. No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory positioning of dual-chamber pacemaker with leads in
 the right atrium and right ventricle with no pneumothorax.
