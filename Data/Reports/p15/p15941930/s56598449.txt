                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after dual-chamber
 pacemaker through the right subclavian vein.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 The right-sided pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is rotated and within those
 limitations cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Substantial
 interstitial changes in the lung bases, right, better appreciated than left,
 are noted and might reflect mild vascular engorgement but infectious process
 is a possibility, reassessment with symmetric chest radiograph is recommended.
 No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.  No discontinuation of the pacemaker
 leads demonstrated.
