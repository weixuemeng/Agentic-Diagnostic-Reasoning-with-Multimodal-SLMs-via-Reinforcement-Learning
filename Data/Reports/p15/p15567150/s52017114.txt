                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Stroke.  Question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post mitral valve replacement.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a new opacity
 obscuring the right side of the heart suggesting a right middle lobe opacity
 and there is also a vague geographic opacity projecting over the left upper
 lung.  Linear opacity in the left lower lung suggests minor atelectasis. 
 There are pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal opacities including right middle lobe opacity and
 faint left upper lobe opacity.  These are nonspecific and could be seen with
 atelectasis or an inflammatory process such as pneumonia or even aspiration. 
 Short-term followup radiographs are recommended to evaluate further and to see
 whether these persist.
