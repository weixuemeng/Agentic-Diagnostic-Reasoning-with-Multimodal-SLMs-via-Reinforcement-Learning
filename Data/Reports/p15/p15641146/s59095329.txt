                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with large right-sided pleural effusion status
 post chest tube placement.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumothorax and tube
 location.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new left-sided chest tube is noted projecting over the lung base.
 There has been significant evacuation of the left-sided pleural effusion with
 some residual effusion still noted.  A small apical pneumothorax is present. 
 Patchy opacities in the left upper/mid lung cannot be compared with prior exam
 as these were obscured by the layering effusion but may represent atelectasis.
 The right lung is clear.  There is no right-sided pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac size cannot be assessed due to obscuration of the left
 heart border.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New left-sided chest tube in appropriate position.  Significant interval
 improvement of left-sided pleural effusion post-evacuation.  Small apical
 left-sided pneumothorax is present.
 
 2.  Hazy patchy opacities in the left upper/mid lung may represent
 atelectasis. Attention on follow up is recommended.
