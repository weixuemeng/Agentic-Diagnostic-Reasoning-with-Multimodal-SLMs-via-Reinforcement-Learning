                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A large left pleural effusion is noted with associated rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures.  A small component of this effusion appears to be
 loculated at the apex. Ill-defined opacity within the left apex is present.  
 Right lung is grossly clear.  Heart size is difficult to evaluate given the
 presence of the large left pleural effusion.  No pulmonary vasculature
 congestion is noted.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large left pleural effusion.  Patchy opacity within the left apex, for which
 comparison with previous exams is recommended as this finding is nonspecific,
 and could relate to an area of infection or inflammation though neoplasm is
 also not excluded.  If no prior exams exist, then CT with contrast is
 suggested for further assessment.
