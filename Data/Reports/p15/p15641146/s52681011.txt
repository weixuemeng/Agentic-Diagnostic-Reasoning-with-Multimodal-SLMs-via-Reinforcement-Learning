 AP CHEST, 11:12 A.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pleural effusion and likely lung cancer.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Volume of the persistent left apical pneumothorax is small, essentially
 unchanged since ___.  Combination of atelectasis or consolidation in the
 left lower lobe and the juxtahilar mass is unchanged.  Small left pleural
 effusion is larger.  Right lung is hyperinflated due to emphysema, but
 otherwise clear.  Leftward shift of the lower mediastinum suggests either
 pleural restriction or atelectasis due to bronchial occlusion.
