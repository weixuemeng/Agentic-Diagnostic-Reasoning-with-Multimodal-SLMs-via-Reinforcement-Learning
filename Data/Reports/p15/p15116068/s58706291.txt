                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with persistent cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe bronchiectasis is chronic, involving the anterior lungs (upper and
 middle lobes), and superior segments of the lower lobes.  Fine peribronchial
 reticulation around the left hilum is likely due to infiltration of the lung
 adjacent to active, suppurative bronchiectasis.  Heart size normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no evidence for
 pulmonary edema, pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Infiltration around the left hilum, likely due to active suppurative
 bronchiectasis.  No consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 2. Severe chronic bronchiectasis.
