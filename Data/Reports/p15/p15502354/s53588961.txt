                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, tachypnea, and fevers.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The exam is limited by low lung volumes and body habitus.  Within
 the limitations, there is no change in the diffuse interstitial prominence,
 possibly due to chronic vascular congestion.  There is no focal air space
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contour
 remains slightly prominent, although unchanged.  The heart size is normal. 
 Extensive flowing anterior osteophytes are noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
