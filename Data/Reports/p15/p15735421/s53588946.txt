                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with PICC line from previous admission,
 confirm placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of chest has been obtained with patient upright
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest
 examination of ___.
 
 On the present frontal view the presence of a left-sided PICC line can be
 identified with difficulty as the line does not contain the initial guidewire
 anymore.  Thus one sees the line in the left axillary area and reaching and
 traversing the midline.  Its termination point, however, is uncertain because
 of the low contrast.
 
 Similar difficulties on the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of
 ___ where the presence of a left-sided PICC line was not mentioned
 at all.  On the portable chest examination of ___, the left-sided
 PICC line was better demonstrated as it contained the guidewire and was seen
 to terminate in the mid portion of the SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Faintly visible left-sided PICC line.  Termination point somewhat
 uncertain' either higher up or mid portion of SVC.  An additional chest
 lateral view could help to identify the line and solve the question.  No PICC
 line related chest complications are seen.
 
 Covering ___ was informed about findings via page.
