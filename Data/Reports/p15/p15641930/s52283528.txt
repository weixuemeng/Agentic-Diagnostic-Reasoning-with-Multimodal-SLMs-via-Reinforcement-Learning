                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged although slightly less
 prominent as compared to the prior study.  The aortic knob remains calcified. 
 There is increase in perihilar opacities compared to the prior study of note
 in the right upper and lower lobe as well as in the left perihilar region,
 findings which may be due to worsened asymmetric pulmonary edema, however,
 underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not excluded.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Compression of at least one vertebral body at thoracolumbar junction not seen
 on the lateral view is of indeterminate age.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Increase in
 perihilar opacities particularly in the right upper, lower, left perihilar
 region while could relate to worsened pulmonary edema, but underlying
 consolidation due to infection and/or aspiration not excluded.
