                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with remote smoking history and recent evaluation at outside
 facility recommending chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made with the study of ___.  Again there is
 hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  There
 is prominence of the hilar regions, which has essentially been unchanged over
 ___ years.  It was probably these areas, especially on the left, that caused
 the radiologist to suggest a CT since no previous plain films were available.
 
 The lack of change ovr ___ years decreases the likelihood of relevant
 abnormality.  However, in view of the smoking history and hyperexpansion, CT
 could be obtained to exclude any hilar malignant process.
