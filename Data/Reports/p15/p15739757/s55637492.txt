                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  With pneumonia, no improvement on antibiotics, interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle left
 perihilar opacity similar as compared to the prior study although unclear
 whether artifactual or a true consolidation.  No new consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  Mild left perihilar opacity may
 be artifactual; however, in the appropriate clinical setting, a subtle
 pneumonia is not entirely excluded.  No new focal consolidation.
