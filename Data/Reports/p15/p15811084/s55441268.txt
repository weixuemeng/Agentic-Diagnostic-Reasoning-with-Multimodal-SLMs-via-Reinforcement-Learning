  Linear opacities in the right mid and upper lung likely represent Platelike
  atelectais. Increased opacification along the medial right hemidiaphragm may
  be related to atelectasis or consolidation. Minimal atelectasis at the left
  base. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax. Right port and left IJ line
  are appropriately placed. Presumed enteric tube terminates in the lower
  thorax, probably in the neoesophagus.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p esophagectomy  // eval for ptx      eval for
 ptx
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  There is increased opacification at the bases, especially
 on the right medially, most likely representing postoperative atelectatic
 change. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
 
 Right IJ catheter extends to the lower portion of the SVC. Left IJ sheath is
 in place. Nasogastric tube extends to the neo esophagus, several cm above the
 esophagogastric junction level.
