                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with cough for two months and history of breast cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Rounded opacity projecting over the costovertebral junction of the left
 posterior 3rd rib may represent summation of structures although a lung or
 bony lesion cannot be excluded. Multiple surgical clips projecting over the
 left hemithorax are due to prior breast procedures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rounded opacity projecting over the costovertebral junction of
 the left posterior 3rd rib may represent overlapping structures although a
 pulmonary or bony lesion cannot be excluded. Further assessment with chest CT
 on a non-emergent basis is recommended.
