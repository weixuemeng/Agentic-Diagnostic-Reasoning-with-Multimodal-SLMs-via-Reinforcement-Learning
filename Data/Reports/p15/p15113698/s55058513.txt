                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man found down, intubated with acute desaturation  //
 contfirm tube position, r/o PTX, pulm edema, other acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The
 monitoring and support devices are in constant position. The lung volumes have
 slightly decreased. Moderate cardiomegaly with mild fluid overload but no
 overt pulmonary edema persists.  Small areas of atelectasis at both the left
 and the right lung bases have mildly increased. Blunting of the right
 costophrenic sinus is mimicking a small right pleural effusion but is likely
 caused by a slight patient rotation.  No evidence of pneumonia.
