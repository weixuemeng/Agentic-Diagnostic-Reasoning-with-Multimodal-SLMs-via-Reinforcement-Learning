                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and confusion after recent fall.  Evaluate for
 effusion or fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable upright radiograph of the chest was provided.  There is a moderate
 right and small left pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascular redistribution is
 noted.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  Mild cardiomegaly is present.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  No rib fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate right and small left pleural effusions with pulmonary vascular
 redistribution consistent with decompensated congestive heart failure. 
 Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No rib fracture is seen, although
 the technique is quite limited.  If there is further clinical concern, please
 obtain dedicated a rib series.
