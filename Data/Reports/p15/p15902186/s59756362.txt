                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with tachy and fever  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Subtle opacity projects over the lateral right mid chest at approximately the
 level of the right lateral fifth and sixth ribs of unclear clinical
 significance.  Consider shallow oblique radiographs for further assessment. 
 No pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Subacute appearing
 deformities of the left anterior lateral fifth, lateral sixth, and lateral
 seventh ribs may be due to prior injury/fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle focal opacity projecting over the lateral right mid lung without clear
 correlate on the lateral view, of unclear clinical significance. Suggest
 shallow oblique radiographs for further assessment.
