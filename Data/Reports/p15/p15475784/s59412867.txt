                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, hypotension  // infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior relevant imaging is available on PACS at the time of
 this dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Bilateral streaky opacities are most likely consistent
 with atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be completely
 excluded in the appropriate clinical situation.  The heart may be mildly
 enlarged in the setting of low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion, edema, or
 pneumothorax.  The stomach is distended with air and ingested contents.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes limits detailed evaluation.  Lower lung atelectasis,
 although superimposed consolidation cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Distended stomach.
