                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lower extremity edema and lung crackles.  Evaluate for fluid
 overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___, ___ and ___.  CTA chest ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  A right subclavian MediPort
 terminates within the right atrium.  The heart size remains mildly enlarged. 
 There is again noted to be diffuse and mild interstitial prominence.  There is
 no evidence for pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax
 or focal airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  A nodule seen in the
 left mid lung was better evaluated on the recent CT.  Additional, smaller FDG
 avid lung nodules are not well seen.
