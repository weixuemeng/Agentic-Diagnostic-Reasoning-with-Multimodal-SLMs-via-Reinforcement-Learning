                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CTA.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the lower SVC.  Heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with mild calcification
 of the thoracic aorta again noted.  Mildly increased interstitial markings are
 noted diffusely, which could reflect mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 Known bilateral pulmonary nodules are better demonstrated on the prior chest
 CTA.  Streaky bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Known bilateral pulmonary nodules better assessed on previous CT.
