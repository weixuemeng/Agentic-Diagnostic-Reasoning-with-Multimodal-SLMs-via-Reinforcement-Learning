                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with airway obstruction s/p trach with increased
 sputum production and cough  // ?pna     ?pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 04:27
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 10:30 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a tracheostomy tube which appears to be in satisfactory
 position.  Lungs remain well inflated without evidence of focal airspace
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No large effusions. No pneumothorax.
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Lucency anteriorly on
 the lateral view raises the possibility of pneumomediastinum which could be
 explained given recent placement of a tracheostomy tube.  Clinical correlation
 is advised.
