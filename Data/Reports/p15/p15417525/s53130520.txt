 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size with a left
 ventricular configuration.  There is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta. 
 Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is a
 mild generalized interstitial process.  Differential considerations include
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion versus atypical pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial abnormality; differential considerations
 include mild vascular congestion or atypical infection.
