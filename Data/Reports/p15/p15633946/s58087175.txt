                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Removal of chest tube for pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___ at ___ p.m., the chest tube has been removed.  A small
 pneumothorax is present, slightly more pronounced than on the earlier film. 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen is hyperinflation
 consistent with COPD, cardiomegaly, some distortion of the right pulmonary
 hilum, tenting of the right hemidiaphragm, and changes in caliber of the
 trachea.
