                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 13:49
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post right upper lobectomy.  Assess for interval
 change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 22:21.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 13:49 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right paratracheal superior hilar soft tissue opacity is again seen. 
 There now appears to be an air fluid level along the superior most aspect
 which may represent a loculated hydropneumothorax.  Followup imaging would be
 advised.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss.
 Minimal residual chest wall subcutaneous emphysema.  Streaky linear opacities
 at the left base are again seen likely reflecting scarring or subsegmental
 atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.  Stable mildly enlarged heart and unfolded
 tortuous aorta.
