                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Right upper lobe pneumothorax with chest tube, the pigtail
 catheter is now clamped.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a 5 mm right
 apical pneumothorax visible after clamping of the tube.  No evidence of
 tension.  The course of the tube is unchanged.  Improved lung volumes, likely
 to reflect improved ventilation, unchanged moderate cardiomegaly without
 pulmonary edema and fibrotic changes around the right hilus.
