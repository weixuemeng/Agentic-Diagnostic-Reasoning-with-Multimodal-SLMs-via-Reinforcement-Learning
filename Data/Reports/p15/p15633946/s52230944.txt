                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Right upper lobectomy.  Pneumothorax.  Chest tube removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___ at 11:07 a.m.
 
 Right apical pigtail pleural drain is still in place, but the moderate right
 pneumothorax is substantially larger.  Postoperative appearance of the right
 hilus is stable, but there is greater opacification at the periphery of the
 right lung that should be reevaluated after the lung reexpansion to make sure
 it is atelectasis and not hemorrhage or pneumonia.  Subsegmental atelectasis
 has recurred in the left lung.  Heart is moderately enlarged.  Lateral view
 shows the extent of moderate volume of pleural fluid in the right
 hydropneumothorax.
 
 The surgical resident was notified of these findings by telephone at the time
 of dictation.
