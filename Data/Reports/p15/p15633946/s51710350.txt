                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post right upper lobectomy with resolving
 pneumothorax, here to reevaluate for interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right apical pigtail pleural catheter is unchanged in position. 
 A tiny anterobasal right-sided pneumothorax is decreased from ___ with
 improved aeration in the right lower lobe.  A persistent right paratracheal
 opacity is likely postoperative in etiology and unchanged from multiple prior
 studies.  Evidence of volume loss in the right hemithorax is consistent with
 right upper lobectomy.  A small right-sided pleural effusion is noted on the
 lateral radiograph.  No focal consolidation is present.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  There is decreased pneumomediastinum.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tiny residual right pneumothorax improved from ___.
 2.  Decreased pneumomediastinum.
 3.  Stable postoperative appearance status post right upper lobectomy.
