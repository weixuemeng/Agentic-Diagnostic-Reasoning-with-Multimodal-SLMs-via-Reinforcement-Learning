                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Clamped chest tube.  Assess for pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate right-sided pigtail
 catheter  in unchanged position.  Fluid collection along the right
 paramediastinum may represent loculated hydropneumothorax, unchanged since
 prior.  The mediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly persists. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.  There is no left pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 In comparison to study obtained five hours prior, there is no significant
 change in right paramediastinal fluid collection which may represent loculated
 hydropneumothorax.
