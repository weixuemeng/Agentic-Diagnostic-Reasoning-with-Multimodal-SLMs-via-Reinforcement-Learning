                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with right upper lobe non-small cell
 lung cancer, status post VATS right upper lobectomy.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  The previously remaining small right-sided apical
 postoperative pneumothorax cannot be identified anymore.  Scar formation
 occupies now the right superior mediastinum, but no new pulmonary abnormality
 is seen.  Prominence of right hilum is unchanged.  Mild elevation of
 right-sided diaphragm as before.  No new pulmonary abnormalities are seen. 
 The left-sided hemithorax is unremarkable.  Both posterior pleural sinuses are
 clear on the lateral view which eliminates any residual free pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Regression of postoperative residuals.  No new abnormalities.  No
 remaining pneumothorax.
