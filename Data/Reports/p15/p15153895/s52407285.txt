 CHEST TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with pancreatic cancer and elevated white blood
 cell count.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is a small right-sided
 pleural effusion.  Right basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis noting
 infection cannot be entirely excluded.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right-sided pleural effusion.  Right basilar opacity may be
 due to atelectasis noting that infection would be difficult to exclude.  CT
 would be more sensitive for the detection of metastatic disease.
