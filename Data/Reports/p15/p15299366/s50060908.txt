                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain, evaluate for
 pneumothorax or infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs and pleural spaces are essentially clear without evidence of
 pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  Redemonstration of right hilar prominence
 likely reflects an enlarged right pulmonary artery as seen on prior CT and
 x-ray.  Heart size is within upper limits of normal.  There is tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.  Retrocardiac opacity is stable and likely reflects
 underlying atelectasis.  Osseous structures are grossly unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  Stable prominence to the right
 perihilar region that likely reflects enlargement of the right pulmonary
 artery.
