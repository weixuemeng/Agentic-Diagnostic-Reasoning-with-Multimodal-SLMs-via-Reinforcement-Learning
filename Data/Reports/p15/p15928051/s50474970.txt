                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fatigue, cough, chest wall pain, rule out
 pneumonia or mass.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate clear lungs
 without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in
 size.  The main pulmonary artery is mildly prominent, which may be a normal
 variant, however in the appropriate clinical setting pulmonary arterial
 enlargement cannot be excluded on this study. The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  No displaced fracture is seen.  If there is further concern for rib
 injury, recommend repeat dedicated views with a BB marker placed to mark the
 site of the patient's pain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The main pulmonary artery is mildly prominent, which may be a
 normal variant, however in the appropriate clinical setting pulmonary arterial
 enlargement cannot be excluded on this study.
