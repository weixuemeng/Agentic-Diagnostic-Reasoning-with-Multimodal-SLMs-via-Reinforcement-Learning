                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post Maze procedure.  Question pneumothorax after chest tube
 removal.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  Left basilar opacities persist, but perhaps
 minimally improved.  A Trace pleural effusion may be new on the right.  It is
 difficult to exclude a very small pleural effusion on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax.
