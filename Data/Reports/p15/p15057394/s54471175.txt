                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The patient is
 apparently status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a mild increase in patchy opacity
 in the left lower lobe which suggests minor atelectasis.  Elsewhere the lungs
 appear clear.  Deformity of the left anterior lateral left fifth rib appears
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild increase in opacity at the left lung base suggesting mild increase in
 pre-existing atelectasis; no definite evidence of disease.
