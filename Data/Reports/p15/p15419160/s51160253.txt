                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CABG 8 weeks ago now with increased HR, ?RLLL.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size remains mildly
 enlarged but unchanged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema is worse in the interval.  More focal patchy opacity in the right lung
 base may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema or atelectasis, however early
 infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions have decreased in size compared to the prior study.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, worse in the interval.  Decreased small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  More focal right basilar patchy opacity may
 reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema or atelectasis, but early infection is not
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
