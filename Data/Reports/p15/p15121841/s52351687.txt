                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 minimal left base atelectasis.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Slight prominence of the left hilum on the
 frontal view without correlates on the lateral view is stable.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  On the lateral view,
 there may be a slight obscuration of the retrosternal clear space with a 2.5 x
 1.8 cm opacity.  However, this appears to be artifactual as on the second
 lateral view it is no longer present.
