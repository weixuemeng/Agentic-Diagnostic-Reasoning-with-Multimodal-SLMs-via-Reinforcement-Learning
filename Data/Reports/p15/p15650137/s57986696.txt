                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough for 10 days, suspected right lower lobe
 pneumonia, followup.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.  The most recent prior
 study is from ___ with the outside study not available for
 comparison.
 
 Current examination demonstrates right mid lobe consolidation and right lower
 lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia.  In addition, there is new
 opacity in the mid left lung that also may reflect infectious process. 
 Nodular opacity is projecting over the anterior aspect of the sixth left rib,
 seen on the prior study might potentially represent bone island versus
 pulmonary nodule.  Comparison with prior studies is required as well as
 subsequent followup to document the resolution of the abnormality in the right
 lower lung.  If findings are persistent, assessment with chest CT would be
 required.  
 
 The patient is most likely after bilateral mastectomy.
