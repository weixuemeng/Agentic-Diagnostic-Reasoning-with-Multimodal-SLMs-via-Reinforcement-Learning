                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall from standing onto back of head.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Scarring within the lung
 apices appear similar.  Lungs remain hyperinflated.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle posteriorly is unchanged which may be due to chronic
 pleural thickening or trace left pleural effusion.  No new focal
 consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures is re- demonstrated with loss of
 height of several mid thoracic vertebral bodies, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Chronic blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle suggestive of chronic pleural thickening or trace left
 pleural effusion.
