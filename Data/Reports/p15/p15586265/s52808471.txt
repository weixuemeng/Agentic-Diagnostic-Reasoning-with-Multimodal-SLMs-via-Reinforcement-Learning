                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall, tachycardia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 diffusely calcified.  Hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle likely suggest the presence of a small pleural effusion.  Patchy left
 basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded. 
 Scarring within the lung apices is symmetric.  Mild diffuse interstitial
 opacities likely reflect chronic interstitial abnormality.  There is diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures with loss of height of several
 thoracic vertebral bodies, of indeterminate age.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable small left pleural effusion and patchy left basilar opacity,
 potentially atelectasis.  Loss of height of several thoracic vertebral bodies
 of indeterminate age.
