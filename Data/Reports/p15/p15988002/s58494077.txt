                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status, brain mass
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is diffusely calcified
 and tortuous.  There is mild pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness and
 vascular indistinctness.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present, however the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of
 view.  More focal patchy left basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis but
 infection or aspiration is not excluded.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.  Patchy left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis but
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
