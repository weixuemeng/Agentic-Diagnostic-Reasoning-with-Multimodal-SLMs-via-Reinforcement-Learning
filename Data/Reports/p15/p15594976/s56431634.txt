                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Breast cancer status post chemotherapy and radiation
 with left breast pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right-sided Port-A-Cath,
 terminating in the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax.  There are low
 lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable given differences in
 inspiration.  Again there is an anterior wedge deformity of a lower thoracic
 vertebral body with mild kyphosis at this level, also seen on the prior study,
 however, the compression may be slightly progressed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes without definite focal consolidation.
 2.  Again seen wedge deformity in a lower thoracic spine vertebra with focal
 mild kyphosis at this level, and possible slight increase in compression.
