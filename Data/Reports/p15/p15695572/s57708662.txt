                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post trauma
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso from ___.  
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There has been interval removal of a
 dialysis catheter.  There is diffuse pulmonary vascular congestion and
 bilateral small pleural effusions, with a small amount of fluid seen layering
 in the minor fissure.  Consolidation at the lung bases is likely related to
 compressive atelectasis due to overlying pleural effusions.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No definite rib fracture is identified on this chest
 radiographic examination.  Thoracic vertebral body heights appear preserved. 
 Mild apparent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is likely secondary to AP
 technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary vascular congestion with bilateral small pleural
 effusions, increased from recent prior examination.
