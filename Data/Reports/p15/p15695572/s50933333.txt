                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening pulmonary edema and possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again some
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural effusions and
 compressive atelectasis at the bases.  There may be mild elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  
 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia
 would have to be seriously considered.
