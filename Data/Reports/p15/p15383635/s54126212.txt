                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left-sided RCC, evaluate for lung metastasis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are noted to be decreased. Rounded opacities overly the
 bilateral lower lobes and likely represent nipple shadows, although pulmonary
 nodules cannot be excluded. An additional rounded density is seen at the
 lateral aspect of the left upper lobe, and may represent a pulmonary nodule.
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary
 edema identified.  Specifically, there is no evidence of intrathoracic
 metastases.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Paired, rounded opacities in the RLL and LLL. Most likely representing
 nipple shadows. Recommend bilateral oblique views with nipple markers to
 exclude pulmonary nodules.
 
 2. Subtle, rounded opacity along the lateral aspect of the LUL. Recommend
 attention of follow up.
