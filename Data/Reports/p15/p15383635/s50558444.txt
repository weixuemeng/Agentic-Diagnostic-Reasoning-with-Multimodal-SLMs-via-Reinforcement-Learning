                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left-sided renal cell carcinoma.  Followup views with nipple markers
 requested.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Nodular
 densities projecting over each lower lung correspond to nipples as confirmed
 by coinciding application of nipple markers.  Oblique views are not included
 in this series.  However, a third density is again faintly visualized on one
 of the included PA views.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a mild rightward convex curvature
 to the thoracic spine with small multilevel osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Confirmation of bilateral nipple shadows, but persistent
 incompletely characterized nodular focus in the left upper lung.  Oblique
 views were not performed for this study.  Management alternatives include
 acquisition of oblique views to assess the third opacity versus consideration
 of chest CT.
