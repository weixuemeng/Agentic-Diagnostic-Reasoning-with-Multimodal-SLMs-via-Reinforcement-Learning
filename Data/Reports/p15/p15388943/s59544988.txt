                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild bilateral hilar fullness and a mild interstitial
 abnormality, although somewhat less striking than on the prior examination. 
 This appearance may be due to mild vascular congestion.  Small suspected
 bilateral pleural effusions are supportive.  Patchy basilar opacities are
 likely due to atelectasis.  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion including new small
 pleural effusions.
