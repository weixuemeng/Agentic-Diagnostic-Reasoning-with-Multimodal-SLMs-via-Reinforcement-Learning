                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with sternal wire coming out of skin, question
 fluid, question infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  Diaphragm is flattened, consistent with COPD.  A calcified
 left upper lobe granuloma is stable.  Atelectasis is present at the left base.
 Midline sternotomy wires are intact.  The fourth sternotomy wire from the top
 does extend anteriorly.  Radiography is not the optimal modality to assess for
 fluid collections or infection.  No pneumothorax or effusion is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left basilar opacity suggestive of atelectasis.
 
 2.  Radiography is not the ideal modality to assess for sternum fluid
 collections or infection.  Nuclear medicine bone scintigraphy would be a
 better modality to assess for osteomyelitis if this is a concern.
