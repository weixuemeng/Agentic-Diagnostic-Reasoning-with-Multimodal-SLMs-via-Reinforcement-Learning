                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Productive cough 24 hours.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  There is a calcified
 nodule in the left upper lobe again noted compatible with a calcified
 granuloma.  The lungs are hyperinflated with widened AP diameter and flattened
 diaphragms suggestive of underlying COPD.  There is no focal consolidation, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  The imaged
 osseous structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD, no superimposed pneumonia.
