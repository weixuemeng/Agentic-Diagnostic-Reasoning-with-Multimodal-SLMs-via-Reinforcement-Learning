                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cp  // ? effusion, consolidation, ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrate hyperinflated lungs.  Increased
 opacity the right lower lung base new since prior study is not convincing for
 infection.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There may be
 aortic valvular calcification.  There is no pleural effusion.  Apical pleural
 parenchymal scarring, right greater than left, is unchanged.
 
 Head is turned to the right, but there is the suggestion of slight leftward
 displacement of the upper tracheal which could be due to a right-sided goiter.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No convincing evidence of pneumonia.
 
 Possible aortic valvular calcification.
 
 Possible right goiter.  Clinical correlation recommended.
