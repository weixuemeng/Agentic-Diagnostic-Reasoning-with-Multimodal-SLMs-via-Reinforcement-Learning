                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with right sided  chest pain, shortness of breath//
 eval for pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment of the lung apices is slightly obscured by the patient's chin and
 neck projecting over these areas.  Left-sided pacer device is noted with leads
 in unchanged positions in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Severe
 cardiomegaly persists.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Previously noted mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Small left pleural
 effusion appears similar in size.  Retrocardiac opacification and patchy right
 basilar opacities may reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded. 
 No definite pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly limited assessment of the lung apices.  Mild pulmonary edema,
 improved in the interval with similar-appearing small left pleural effusion. 
 Retrocardiac opacification and patchy right basilar opacities may reflect
 atelectasis, but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
