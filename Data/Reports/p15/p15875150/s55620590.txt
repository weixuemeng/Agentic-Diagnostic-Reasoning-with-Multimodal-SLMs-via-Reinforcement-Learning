                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Post-operative fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to

 There is substantial interval increase in right pleural effusion that
 potentially might reflect intra-abdominal process.  Left mid lower lung
 opacity most likely reflects lingular atelectasis, unchanged since the prior
 study.  The right upper quadrant drain is in place.  There is no pneumothorax.
