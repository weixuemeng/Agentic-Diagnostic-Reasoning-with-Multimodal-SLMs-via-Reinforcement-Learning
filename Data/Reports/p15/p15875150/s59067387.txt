                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after segmental liver
 resection, one day after surgery, currently with fever.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to
 preoperative study from ___.
 
 The lung volumes are lower than on the prior study.  There is most likely
 right lower lung consolidation which might represent a combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis, but infectious process in the right lower lobe
 cannot be excluded.  The rest of the lungs are clear.  The surgical drain is
 projecting as expected over the right upper quadrant.
