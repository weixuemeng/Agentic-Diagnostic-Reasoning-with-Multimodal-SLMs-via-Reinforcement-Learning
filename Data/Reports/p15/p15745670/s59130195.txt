                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old smoker with cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Small branching opacity at the base of the left lung has a different
 configuration today than on ___.  The shape makes malignancy very
 unlikely.  If symptoms persist, I would repeat conventional chest radiograph
 in four weeks when bronchial inflammation would have had time to clear.  Lungs
 are otherwise clear.  Hila are not enlarged but nodal lymph node
 calcifications are probably bilateral.  Heart and mediastinal contours and
 pleural surfaces are normal.
