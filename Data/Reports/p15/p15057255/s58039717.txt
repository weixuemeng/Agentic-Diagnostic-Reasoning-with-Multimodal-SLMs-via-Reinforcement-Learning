                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever and nausea.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Dense retrocardiac opacity with air-fluid level is
 compatible with hiatal hernia as previously seen.  The lungs are otherwise
 grossly clear based on this exam which has poor inspiratory effort.  There is
 no pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable
 as are the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process given an exam with low
 inspiratory effort.  Large retrocardiac hiatal hernia.
