                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Increased
 interstitial markings are again noted diffusely, likely reflective of a
 chronic interstitial abnormality and appear unchanged there has been interval
 development of bilateral lung masses and nodules, with the largest lesion in
 the left upper lobe measuring up to 3.4 cm and a second lesion in the right
 upper lobe measuring up to 3.2 cm.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may
 reflect areas of atelectasis.  A small left pleural effusion is likely
 present.  Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  No
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval development of bilateral pulmonary nodules and masses concerning for
 metastatic disease.  Bibasilar opacities likely atelectasis.  Chronic
 interstitial abnormality as seen previously.  Probable mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
