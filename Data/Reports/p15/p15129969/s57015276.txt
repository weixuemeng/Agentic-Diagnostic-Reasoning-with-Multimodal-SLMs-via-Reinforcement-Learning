                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph available for comparison.  Reference
 made to chest CT from ___ and PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There are low
 lung volumes and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Overlying right base
 atelectasis is seen.  There is also mild left base atelectasis.  Slight
 prominence of the hila.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable as
 compared to scout radiograph from PET-CT from ___.
 
 A right upper lobe opacity corresponds to pulmonary nodule seen on PET-CT.
 There is mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Trace blunting of the
 right and posterior right costophrenic angle, most likely relates to low lung
 volume rather than trace pleural effusion.
