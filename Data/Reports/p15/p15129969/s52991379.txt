 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits given

 again chronically elevated, although there is a small-to-moderate right
 pleural effusion as well with associated atelectasis, similar to ___
 chest CT.  A developing right upper lung consolidation is noted.  The left
 lung demonstrates an apical mass, increased in size.

 2. Developing right upper lung consolidation.  
 3. Stable right hemidiaphragmatic elevation with small-to-moderate pleural
 effusion and associated atelectasis.
