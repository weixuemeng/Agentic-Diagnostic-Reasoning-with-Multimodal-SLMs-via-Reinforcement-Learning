                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Desaturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___ and chest CT, ___.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Patient rotation and overlying trauma
 board slightly limit evaluation.  There is complete opacification of the right
 hemithorax, with mild rightward shift of the trachea. Findings are likely due
 to a combination of a right pleural effusion and lung collapse. Patient's
 known right upper lobe mass is obscured due to the presence of complete
 whiteout on the right side.  A left apical mass is again noted. There are low
 lung volumes with streaky opacities in left lung base, which may reflect
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Complete opacification of the right hemithorax likely due to a
 combination of a pleural effusion, right apical mass, and right lung collapse.
