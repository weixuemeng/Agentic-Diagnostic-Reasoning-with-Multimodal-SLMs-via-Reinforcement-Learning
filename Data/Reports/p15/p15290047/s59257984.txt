 Please assess for pneumonia.  // assess interval change     assess interval

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are substantial
 bilateral layering effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases.  What
 appeared to be central vascular congestion bilaterally has decreased.  Tip of
 the endotracheal tube is approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric
 tube extends to the stomach, though the side port is close to the
 esophagogastric junction.  Right IJ pacer wire again extends to the apex of
 the right ventricle.
