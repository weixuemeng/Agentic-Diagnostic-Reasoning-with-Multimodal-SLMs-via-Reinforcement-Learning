                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Left pneumothorax due to rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest taken at end expiration and lateral view compared to
 ___:
 
 Low lung volumes exaggerate airway abnormalities in the lungs, particularly
 consolidation at the left lung base which from a radiographic standpoint could
 be either atelectasis or pneumonia.  Discussion with Dr. ___ ___ no
 findings of pneumonia.  It also exaggerates the volume of the left apical
 pneumothorax which is actually entirely stable.  Small left pleural effusion
 has accumulated, normal physiologic progression of resorbing pneumothorax. 
 Mediastinal widening is a function of low lung volume.  Heart size normal.  No
 pulmonary edema is present.
