                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with left pneumothorax
 after interval left pigtail catheter placement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The left pigtail catheter is in place.  There is a slight interval decrease in
 currently minimal left apical pneumothorax.  Vascular congestion has
 progressed and might be consistent with volume overload.  Left retrocardiac
 opacity is unchanged.
