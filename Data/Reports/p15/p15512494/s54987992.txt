                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate interval change of left pneumothorax.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___ at
 2:01.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left apical pneumothorax is seen between the ___ and 4th rib and is larger
 than on the prior study. Air is also seen in the anterior pleural space on the
 lateral view.  Additionally, there is a retrocardiac opacity most consistent
 with low lung volumes and poor inspiration.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 and hilar contours are largely unchanged.  There is no evidence of effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Left apical pneumothorax is larger than on the prior study. 
 
 2. Left lower lobe opacity most likely due to suboptimal inspiration.  
 
 These findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by telephone at 3:24 on ___, 20 minutes after discovery by Dr. ___.
