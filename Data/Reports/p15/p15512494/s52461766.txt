                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup left pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 10 hours earlier.
 
 Tiny left apical pneumothorax has decreased in size.  Small left effusion is
 probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. 
 Small right effusion is also present.  Vascular congestion has almost
 completely resolved.  The lungs are better expanded.  Bibasilar atelectasis
 has increased on the left.  Left basal pigtail catheter remains in place. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
