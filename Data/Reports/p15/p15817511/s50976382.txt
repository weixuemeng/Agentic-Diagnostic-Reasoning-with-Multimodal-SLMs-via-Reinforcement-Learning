                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed with comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are clear.  No appreciable
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Mild hyperinflation may be seen on
 the lateral radiograph given the flattening of the diaphragms, although it
 might potentially be in part explained by the presence of kyphosis.
