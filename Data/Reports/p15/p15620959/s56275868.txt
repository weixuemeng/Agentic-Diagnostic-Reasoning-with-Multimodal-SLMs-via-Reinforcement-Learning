 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right central venous
 introduction sheath has been removed.  Extent of the pleural effusions
 bilaterally is overall unchanged.  Also unchanged is the degree of bilateral
 basal subsequent atelectasis.  Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette, no pneumothorax.  The sternal wires are in unchanged alignment.
 
 The extent of the pleural effusions is better appreciated on the lateral than
 on the frontal image.
