 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer, shortness of
 breath, rule out effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The heart is
 normal size.  The AP window contour abnormalities as was seen in the prior
 study and is compatible with known lymphadenopathy.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Lungs are well expanded.  Bilateral
 basilar opacities likely represent atelectasis.  There is a new 1 cm nodular
 opacity porjecting over the mid right lung.  No significant pleural effusions.
 No pneumothorax.  Surgical clips are again noted projecting over the right
 base.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New 1-cm nodular opacity projecting over the mid right lung.  A repeat
 chest x-ray is recommended for confirmation, alternatively CT can be used.
 2.  Bilateral basilar opacities likely represent atelectasis.
 3.  Convexity of the AP window represents known hilar lymphadenopathy.
