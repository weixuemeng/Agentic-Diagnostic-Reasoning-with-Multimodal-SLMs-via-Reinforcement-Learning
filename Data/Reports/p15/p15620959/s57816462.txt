                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post MVR, pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 5:46 a.m., the ET tube, NG tube, and Swan-Ganz
 catheter have been removed.  A right IJ sheath remains present, tip over
 proximal SVC.   There is suggestion of kinking of the IJ sheath, perhaps at
 its entry point at the skin. No pneumothorax detected. 
 
 Again seen are sternotomy wires.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains
 prominent, unchanged allowing for technical differences.  Again seen is
 increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation and a small left effusion.  There is atelectasis at the
 right base, different in configuration from the earlier film.  There is
 probably a small right effusion.  There is upper zone redistribution and
 diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF, similar to prior.  Right
 axillary surgical clips noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Interval removal of lines and tubes.  
 2) CHF findings and left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and effusion
 are unchanged.  
 3) Findings at the right base are slightly different in configuration but
 overall similar.  
 4) No pneumothorax detected.
