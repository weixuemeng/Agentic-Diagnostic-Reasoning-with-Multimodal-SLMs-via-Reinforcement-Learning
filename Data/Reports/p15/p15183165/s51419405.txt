                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes, with resultant
 increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. 
 Exploration of the cardiac apex is likely secondary to an epicardial fat pad. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is identified. The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
