 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // desat
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, an area of opacification at the
 right lung base has worsened, likely a combination of consolidation and
 pleural effusion.  Previously present left lower lobe collapse has nearly
 resolved with only minor residual atelectasis remaining.  No other relevant
 change.
