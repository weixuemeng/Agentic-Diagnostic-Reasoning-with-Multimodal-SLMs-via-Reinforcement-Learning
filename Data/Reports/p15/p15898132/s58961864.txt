                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart appears mildly enlarged, the aorta very mildly tortuous.  Superior
 vena cava is perhaps distended to some degree.  There is a mild interstitial
 abnormality suggesting vascular congestion but no focal opacification.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial abnormality, chronicity uncertain although findings could be
 seen with vascular calcification perhaps superimposed on a more chronic lung
 disease.  Mild cardiomegaly.
