                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. 
 Biapical scarring and possible right apical small nodules. Prominence of
 bilateral hila which are somewhat lobulated suggest underlying
 lymphadenopathy.  Trace left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  There is no
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting hilar adenopathy.  Recommend CT for further
 evaluation of this and right upper lung nodules.
