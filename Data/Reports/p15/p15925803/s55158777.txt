                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with NASH cirrhosis, TIPS, fatigue, possible SBP,
 evaluation for right upper lobe crackles.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two subcentimeter nodules, really dense, are seen in right upper
 lobe and could possibly be calcified.
 
 Lung volumes are low with bibasilar mild atelectasis.  The patient has prior
 history of sternotomy for CABG, and the mediastinal and cardiac contours are
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Two subcentimeter right upper lobe lung nodules are really dense, probably
 calcified.  Comparison with a prior chest x-ray from outside hospital would be
 useful to assess their stability.
