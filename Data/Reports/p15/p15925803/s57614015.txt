                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath with recent pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___ and ___.  An enteric tube is seen passing below the
 diaphragm, tip not visualized.  Appearance of the diffuse bilateral
 parenchymal opacities have not significantly changed given differences in
 inspiratory effort.  These are most notable at the right upper lung and left
 mid lung.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires
 are again noted.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  Bilateral parenchymal opacities,
 potentially bilateral infection with possible superimposed vascular
 congestion.
