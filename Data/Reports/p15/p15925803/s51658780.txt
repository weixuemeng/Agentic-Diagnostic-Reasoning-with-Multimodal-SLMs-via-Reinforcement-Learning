  Compared to study of ___, there is is mild worsening of pulmonary
  opacification, particuarly in the right upper lobe, which likely is related to
  worsening pulmonary edema though an infectious process cannot be excluded. The
  PICC still terminates in the low SVC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
  unchanged. D/w Dr. ___ 9:07 p.m..

 HISTORY:  TIPS with new hypoxia, to assess for volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes
 with diffuse pulmonary opacifications throughout both lungs.  Much of this is
 due to pulmonary edema, presumably related to volume overload.  More
 coalescent opacification is seen in the right upper zone, bounded inferiorly
 by the minor fissure.  This could probably reflect a combination of pneumonia
 and volume loss in the right upper lobe.
