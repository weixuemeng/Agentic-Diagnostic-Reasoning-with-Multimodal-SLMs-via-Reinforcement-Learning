                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post fall, recently treated for pneumonia.
 New renal failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___ and chest CT from ___.  Again seen are slightly
 low lung volumes.  Increased interstitial markings seen primarily at the
 bases, perhaps more conspicuous on the current exam.  There is no evidence of
 new confluent consolidation or large effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings potentially from chronic lung
 disease.  Component of interstial edema is also possible.
