 INDICATION:  ___F with likely pneumonia, evaluate for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Indistinct airspace opacities in the right lung base are new from the prior
 study and may represent atelectasis or early consolidation, depending upon the
 clinical setting.  There is no new pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is a
 moderate to large hiatal hernia.
