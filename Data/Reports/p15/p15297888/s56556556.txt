                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with vfib arrest.  Eval for tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiograph: ___ at 18:38 (___)
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position, terminating 4.1 cm above the
 level of the carina.  An enteric tube is in place within the stomach. 
 Confluent right hemi thorax opacities are again noted, along with retrocardiac
 opacities on the left.  Findings could represent hemorrhagic contusions,
 aspiration, or pulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  No displaced rib fractures are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Appropriate position of monitoring and support devices.
 2. Confluent opacities are again seen, more asymmetric on the current study as
 compared to the prior, with most of the opacity involving the right hemi
 thorax.  Differential diagnosis includes pulmonary hemorrhage, aspiration,
 infection, much less likely asymmetric pulmonary edema.  In addition
 retrocardiac left base opacity.
 3. No displaced rib fractures.
