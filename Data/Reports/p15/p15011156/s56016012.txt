                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with abdominal distension and increasing anion
 gap acidosis. Concern for perforation.  // Air under diaphragm?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, inspiratory volumes are lower, with bibasilar
 patchy opacities.  There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle,
 consistent with a small effusion.  No overt CHF.  Pleural parenchymal
 thickening along the superolateral portion of both hemithoraces, right greater
 the left , is noted, unchanged .  The heart is not enlarged.  Aorta is
 calcified.  The left hemidiaphragm is elevated, with underlying loop of gas
 distended bowel (probable gastric fundus).  No free air is detected beneath
 the diaphragm.  Distended loops of bowel noted in the upper abdomen, but the
 abdominal gas pattern not effectively evaluated.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No free air detected beneath the diaphragms.
 2. Bibasilar patchy opacities and trace right pleural effusion.  The
 differential diagnosis includes atelectasis, early infiltrate or aspiration.
