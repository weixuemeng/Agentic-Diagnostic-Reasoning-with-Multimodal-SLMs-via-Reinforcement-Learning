  Bibasilar opacities are slightly more prominent than on the prior exam.  The
  location suggests atelectasis, though infection or aspiration cannot be
  excluded.  No new opacity is identified.  There are likely small bilateral
  pleural effusions, as well.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
  silhouette is normal.
