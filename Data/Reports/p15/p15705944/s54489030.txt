                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of earlier in this date, the PICC line is
 extremely difficult to see since the tip is obscured by the overlying EKG
 lead.  The tip probably is in the mid SVC.  Otherwise, little change.
