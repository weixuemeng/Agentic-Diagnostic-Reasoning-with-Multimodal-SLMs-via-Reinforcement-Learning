                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypokalemia, s/p arrest, now re-intubated 
 // ET tub placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 10:42.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heterogeneous opacification at the lung bases, mild on the right moderate on
 the left has worsened since earlier in the day. This could be due to
 hypoventilation or to aspiration, explaining the rationale for the newly
 placed endotracheal tube which ends 4.5 cm above the carinal. An esophageal
 tube ends in the nondistended stomach. Pleural effusions are small if any. No
 pneumothorax. Left subclavian line ends in the region of the superior
 cavoatrial junction.
