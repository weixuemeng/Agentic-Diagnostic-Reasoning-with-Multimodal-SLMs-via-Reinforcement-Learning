                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates 4.4 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube is
 noted which courses below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach and off the
 inferior borders of the film.  Heart size is normal.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Streaky opacity
 in the left lower lobe likely reflects atelectasis.  No focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus may
 suggest a trace pleural effusion.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Endotracheal and enteric tubes are in standard positions.
 
 2. Left basilar patchy opacity, likely atelectasis.
 
 3. Probable trace right pleural effusion.
