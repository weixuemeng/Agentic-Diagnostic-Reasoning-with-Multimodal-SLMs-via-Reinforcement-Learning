                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ as well as reference to the PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 subtle patchy left base opacity which is not well substantiated on the lateral
 view, and may represent atelectasis or residual parafissural nodule, however,
 underlying consolidation not excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is
 minimal loss of height of the superior endplate of a lower thoracic vertebral
 body, of indeterminate age.
