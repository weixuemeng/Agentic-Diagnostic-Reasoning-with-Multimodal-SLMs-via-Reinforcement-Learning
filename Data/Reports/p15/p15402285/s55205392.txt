                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings
 particularly the lung bases.  Left greater than right bibasilar opacity may
 relate to low lung volumes, although an underlying consolidation due to
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings;
 subtle bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, most likely relate to
 vascular crowding, although in the appropriate clinical setting infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.  Consider repeat/followup study with better
 inspiration when patient is able.
