                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with question of bronchitis and new onset atrial
 fibrillation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There is mild peribronchial cuffing without overt pulmonary
 edema, which could suggest mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a trace right pleural
 effusion.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.  The osseous
 structures are diffusely demineralized.  2 screws are project over the right
 glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion and trace
 right pleural effusion.
