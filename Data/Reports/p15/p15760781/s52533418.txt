                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of seizures, developmental delay,
 status post ORIF of femur fracture, now desaturating to 80s,? aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP chest radiograph is taken with the patient in the upright
 position.  Heart size cannot be accurately assessed from the AP technique. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable except for prominence of right
 paramedian stripe, possibly representing an azygos fissure.  Small area of
 opacity projecting over the left base is compatible with atelectasis or
 consolidation.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Small left pleural effusion. 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small area of opacity in the left lower lobe is consistent with a
 small pleural effusion and superimposed atelectasis, but consolidation cannot
 be excluded.
