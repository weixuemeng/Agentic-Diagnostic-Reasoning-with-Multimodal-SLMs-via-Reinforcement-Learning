                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New atrial fibrillation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size has decreased when compared to the prior study, and now appears
 only mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Bilateral hilar enlargement
 compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension and likely lymphadenopathy is
 stable.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal and the lungs are clear.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Again noted within the left upper quadrant is a gastric band.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality, with interval decrease in size of the
 cardiac silhouette which is only mildly enlarged.  Unchanged bilateral hilar
 enlargement likely due to a combination of pulmonary arterial hypertension and
 lymphadenopathy.
