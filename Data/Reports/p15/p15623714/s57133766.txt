                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p lumbar fusion now with leukocytosis  // eval
 for pna vs. atelectasis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing for patient
 rotation.  Patchy bibasilar opacities are present as well as a linear focus of
 opacity in the periphery of the left lower lobe.  No definite pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect patchy atelectasis or aspiration. 
 Followup radiographs may be helpful to exclude the possibility of an early
 focus of pneumonia.
