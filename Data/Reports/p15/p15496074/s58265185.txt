                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female transferred for pulmonary edema.  Evaluate for
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside facility chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Nodular opacities at the right
 lung base appear new from the prior study performed 4 hours earlier, which may
 represent more focal edema or atelectasis.  No sizable pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinum is not abnormally widened.  Heart size is
 top-normal.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 2. Right lung base nodular opacities appear to have developed over the past 4
 hours, and may represent more focal edema or atelectasis, but superimposed
 infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
