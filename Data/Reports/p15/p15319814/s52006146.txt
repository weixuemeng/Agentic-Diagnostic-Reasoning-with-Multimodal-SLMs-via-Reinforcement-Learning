                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening AA gradient and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is volume loss in both lower lobes with increased opacity at
 the right base.  While some of this is due to volume loss, superimposed
 infection is likely.  The upper lungs are clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right lower lobe infiltrate.  Bilateral lower lobe volume
 loss.
