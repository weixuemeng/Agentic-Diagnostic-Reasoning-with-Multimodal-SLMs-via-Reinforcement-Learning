                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chills and slowly increasing temperature this
 afternoon.
 
 COMPARISON:  Several prior studies dating back to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum when compared to ___ and prior
 examinations demonstrate no evidence of abnormality.  There is interval
 improvement of perihilar and lower lobe opacities most likely consistent with
 improvement of pulmonary edema.  Still present are bibasal, right more than
 left opacities that are potentially reflecting assymetric clearence of
 interstitial edema and they likely represent infectious process, although it
 cannot be entirely excluded.  Free intraperitoneal air is still seen,
 unchanged since the prior study.
