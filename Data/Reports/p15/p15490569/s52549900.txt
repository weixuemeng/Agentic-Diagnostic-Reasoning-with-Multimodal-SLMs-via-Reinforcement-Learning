 There are decreased lung volumes. The right IJ terminates at the cavoatrial
 junction.  There is increased opacity in the right lung base and to a lesser
 extent the left lung base, which may represent atelectasis but cannot exclude
 pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting.  Vascular congestion is
 seen without overt pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Free air is again noted noted under the diaphragm, decreased
 from prior exam and consistent with recent surgery. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.
