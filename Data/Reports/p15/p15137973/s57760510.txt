                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right internal jugular sheath ends just above the clavicles. 
 Bilateral chest tubes are unchanged in location and appearance.  A small
 amount of right subcutaneous air is stable.  A small right pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  Decreased opacification at the left base likely reflects
 improvement in atelectasis.  Sternal wires are intact.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged with a normal postoperative appearance.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improving left basilar atelectasis.
 2.  Small right pleural effusion.
 3.  No pneumothorax.
