  Some right hilar enlargement may represent lymphadenopathy.  No obvious
  pulmonary masses identified.  Lungs are clear.  No pneumothorax.  If there is
  clinical concern, more sensitive evaluation with contrast enhanced chest CT is
  suggested.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Longstanding history of CLL, dyspnea and fatigue, evaluation for
 disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  No direct comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is enlargement of both the left and the right aspects of the
 mediastinum and blunting of the normal mediastinal interfaces.  This is very
 likely to be caused by lymphadenopathy, as visualized, for example, on a CT
 examination from ___.  The extent of the adenopathy could have
 slightly increased in the interval.  The lateral radiograph confirms the
 presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  There is no safe evidence of hilar
 lymphadenopathy.  However, the infracarinal area is also dense and local
 lymphadenopathy must be suspected.
 
 No evidence of parenchymal changes, in particular no evidence of pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
