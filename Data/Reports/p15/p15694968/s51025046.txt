                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post trach.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 Rotated positioning.  Compared with ___ at 5:31 a.m., the ET tube has been
 replaced by tracheostomy tube.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval
 change.  The degree of opacity at the left base appears slightly greater.
