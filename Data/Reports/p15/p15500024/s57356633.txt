  Endotracheal in appropriate position.  Enteric tube courses below the
  diaphragm, coursing at axial the view.
  
  Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the proximal
  right IJ.  No evidence of pneumothorax seen.
  
  Additional tubular structure projects over the right hemi thorax may be
  external to the patient; correlate clinically.
  
  Diffuse opacification over the right lung ; differential diagnosis includes
  mass of aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, infection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dropping o2 sats post intubation*** WARNING ***
 Multiple patients with same last name!  // r/o ptx, assess ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Underlying trauma board and other external artifacts partially obscure the
 view.  Additionally, the exam is under penetrated presumed due to patient body
 habitus.  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. 
 Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out of the field of view.  A right
 internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the proximal right
 internal jugular vein.  An additional linear tubular structure courses over
 the right hemi thorax crossing over to project over the left neck, unclear
 whether this is a internal or external to the patient.  There are low lung
 volumes.  There is diffuse opacity projecting over the right lung. 
 Differential diagnosis includes aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, infection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal in appropriate position.  Enteric tube courses below the
 diaphragm, coursing at axial the view.
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the proximal
 right IJ.
 
 Additional tubular structure projects over the right hemi thorax may be
 external to the patient; correlate clinically.
 
 Diffuse opacification over the right lung ; differential diagnosis includes
 massive aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, infection.
