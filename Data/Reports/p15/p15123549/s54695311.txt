                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with pelvic bleed; confirm tube placement and
 assess for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Plain radiograph from earlier the same day at 01:09. Correlation
 made to CTA chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of an enteric tube which ends in the distal
 trachea. The accessed left chest wall Infuse-A-Port an enteric tube are
 unchanged in position. There is new right-sided volume loss with elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm and superior displacement of the minor fissure, which
 are likely due to right upper lobe atelectasis. There is also new right lower
 lobe subsegmental atelectasis. New rapidly developing right lung airspace
 opacities containing small air bronchograms may be due to aspiration or
 confluent edema. Hazy opacification over the left lung base may be due to
 worsening atelectasis or a small layering left pleural effusion. The right
 costophrenic angle has been excluded from the field of view, limiting
 assessment for a pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The heart and
 mediastinum are within normal limits despite the projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right upper lobe atelectasis.
 New right lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis.
 New rapidly developing right lung airspace opacities containing air
 bronchograms which may be due to aspiration or confluent edema.
 Increasing left lung base airspace opacity may be due to worsening atelectasis
 or a small layering pleural effusion.
 Lines and tubes in satisfactory position.
