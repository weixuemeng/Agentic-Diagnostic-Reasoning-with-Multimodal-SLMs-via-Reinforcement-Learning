                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new cough and new leukocytosis, having
 difficulty eating at times, NGT also came out  // did he develop aspiration
 pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___, cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  New
 left retrocardiac opacity favors atelectasis, although aspiration and an
 evolving infectious pneumonia are additional considerations.  Small left
 pleural effusion is a persistent finding.  Dilated loops of bowel in the
 imaged upper abdomen are incompletely evaluated on this chest radiograph. 
 Dedicated abdominal radiographs may be helpful to exclude the possibility of
 an obstructive pattern.
