                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, pneumonia, seizures, right frontal stroke.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray from ___ at 10:15 a.m.
 
 There is moderately severe cardiomegaly, with evidence for polychamber
 involvement.  A left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse
 vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  There is a small-to-moderate right
 effusion with some fluid extending into the minor fissure and underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation.  There is also patchy opacity at the left base,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  
 
 Allowing for differences in positioning, the CHF findings may be somewhat
 worse. Otherwise, no definite change compared with ___.
