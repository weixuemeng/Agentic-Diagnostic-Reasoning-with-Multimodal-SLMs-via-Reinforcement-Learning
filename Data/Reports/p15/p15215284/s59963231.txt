                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Status epilepticus, after intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, obtained at 04:40 p.m.
 
 The pacemaker leads are demonstrated and the NG tube is in the appropriate
 position within the stomach.  The ET tube tip appears to be 3.3 cm above the
 carina and potentially impinges tracheal wall, although the patient was imaged
 in substantially rotated position.  The rest of the findings including
 bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal consolidations are redemonstrated
 overall unchanged.
