                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Traumatic brain injury and the seizure disorder, here for
 colonoscopy prep, now with new fever.  Evaluate for acute infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP chest radiograph is severely rotated, but demonstrates
 clear lungs.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are difficult to evaluate due
 to rotation, but appears essentially clear.  The heart size is normal.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Technically limited study due to severe rotation, with no obvious
 source for infection.
