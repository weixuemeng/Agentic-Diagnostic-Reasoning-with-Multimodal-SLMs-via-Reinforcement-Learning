 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Increased
 opacity at the base of the left lung likely represents a small left pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion and the pulmonary opacity at the base of the left
 lung likely represents atelectasis however infection should be considered in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
