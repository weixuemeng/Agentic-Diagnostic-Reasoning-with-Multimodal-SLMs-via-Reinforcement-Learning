                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Hickman catheter, chest pain two days ago.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 A vascular catheter traverses a right internal jugular stent to the low SVC. 
 What appears to be a roughly 10 cm long curved catheter fragment projecting
 over the right upper abdominal quadrant or lower chest on the frontal view
 cannot be localized on the lateral and could in fact be an artifact of some
 sort.  I would like the opportunity to fluoroscope this patient and localize
 what could be a fragment.
 
 Lungs are clear and there is no pleural abnormality or evidence of central
 adenopathy.  Heart size is normal.  Dr. ___ was telephoned.  If patient is
 not available for fluoroscopy, routine oblique chest radiograph should
 suffice.
