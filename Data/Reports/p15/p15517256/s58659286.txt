                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dysphagia and aspiration.  Please evaluate
 for infiltrate or subcutaneous air.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are low in volume and show a faint right lower lobe opacity. The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The mediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Faint right lower lobe opacity likely represents atelectasis but sequalae of
 aspiration cannot be excluded.  No subcutaneous gas.
