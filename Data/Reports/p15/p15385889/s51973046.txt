                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared with ___, there is increased opacity of the right
 lung base.  Otherwise, bilateral diffuse interstitial opacities are not
 significantly changed.  A prominent right hilus is also similar in appearance
 to prior exam as well as to exam from ___.  A left-sided pleural
 effusion is also stable.  Dense retrocardiac opacity is unachanged and
 compatible with left lower lobe atelectasis.  Otherwise, the mediastinal
 contour is unchanged.  Dense atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob
 are redemonstrated.  Sternotomy wires are intact, and mediastinal clips are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsened opacification of the right lower lung on the background of
 interstitial edema may represent superimposed pneumonia.
 2.  Left-sided pleural effusion with concurrent moderate atelectasis is
 unchanged since at least ___.  Biapical scarring and appearance of a
 prominent right hilus are also stable.
