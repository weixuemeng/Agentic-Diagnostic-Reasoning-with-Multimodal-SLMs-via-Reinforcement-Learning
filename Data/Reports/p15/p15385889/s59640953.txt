                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with recent pneumonia and known CHF.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia versus effusion.
 
 Comparison made to portable AP chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Sternotomy wires are midline and intact. 
 Valvular prosthesis is again noted.  Bibasilar opacifications, right greater
 than left, are worsened since ___ and may represent a combination
 of pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis; however, underlying
 infectious process cannot be completely excluded.  Mild prominence of
 vasculature is concerning for mild pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Bibasilar opacification may represent a combination of pleural effusion and 
 compressive atelectasis; however, supervening pulmonary infection cannot be
 completely excluded and should be considered in the correct clinical setting.
