                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Known CHF with recent pneumonia presenting with weakness,
 question fluid overload or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips as well as a prosthetic cardiac valve
 are noted.  There is interstitial pulmonary edema.  A somewhat more confluent
 consolidation is seen in the right lower lobe which could represent a focus of
 pneumonia.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral effusions.  Possible
 early pneumonia in the right lower lobe.  Follow up post-diuresis to assess
 for underlying pneumonia.
