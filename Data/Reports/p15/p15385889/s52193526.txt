                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever.  For pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Numerous prior chest radiographs most recent ___. 
 CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Patient positioning is suboptimal.  There are low lung volumes.  Bilateral
 opacities, right greater than left, and indistinct pulmonary vasculature is
 compatible with mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  There are small pleural
 effusions, left greater than right.  Bibasilar atelectasis is worse on the
 left with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, likely a combination of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are stable.  There is prior median sternotomy with partially
 visualized intact wires.  There is no large pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Moderate pulmonary edema.
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis worse on the left;
 underlying infection cannot be excluded.
