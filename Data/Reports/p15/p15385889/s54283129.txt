                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with congestive heart
 failure, pleural effusion, and pneumonia.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest as well as right lateral decubitus
 were reviewed.
 
 As compared to ___, there is interval improvement in widespread
 parenchymal opacities, consistent with improvement of pneumonia and
 potentially improvement of pulmonary edema.  Minimal amount of right pleural
 effusion is demonstrated layering, but substantial amount of loculated
 effusion is noted on the lateral radiograph posteriorly.  The patient is after
 replacement of aortic valve.  Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in
 appearance.
