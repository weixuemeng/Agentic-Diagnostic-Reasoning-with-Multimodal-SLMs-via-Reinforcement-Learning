                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Recent pneumonia, complaining of mid back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement.  Interstitial
 pulmonary edema is again seen.  There are bilateral pleural effusions with
 overlying atelectasis.  Additional bibasilar opacities raise concern for
 underlying infection and/or aspiration.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. 
 The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Evidence of DISH is seen along the
 spine.  There is a minimally displaced fracture of the posterolateral left
 seventh rib and a healed nondisplaced fracture of the posterolateral left
 sixth rib, similar in appearance as compared to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. 
 Additional basilar consolidations could be due to infection and/or aspiration.
