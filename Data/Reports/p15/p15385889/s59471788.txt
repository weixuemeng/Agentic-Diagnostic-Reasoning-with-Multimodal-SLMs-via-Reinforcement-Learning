                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with diarrhea on Abx for aspiration PNA  // Acute abdominal
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval improvement in the right lower lobe opacity as well as
 the right pleural effusion.  The cardiac silhouette remains moderately
 enlarged.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is present, but interstitial edema
 has resolved. There is no pneumothorax.  Median sternotomy wires and a
 prosthetic aortic valve are again noted. Dense carotid artery calcifications
 are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved CHF with associated decreased right pleural effusion since ___. A focal right lower lobe consolidation has also improved, and may
 reflect asymmetrical edema or a resolving infectious pneumonia considering the
 history of interval antibiotic therapy.
