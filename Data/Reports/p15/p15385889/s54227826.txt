                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has
 been a thoracentesis with removal of pleural fluid, and no evidence of
 post-procedure pneumothorax.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Retrocardiac opacification persists,
 consistent with atelectasis and effusion.
