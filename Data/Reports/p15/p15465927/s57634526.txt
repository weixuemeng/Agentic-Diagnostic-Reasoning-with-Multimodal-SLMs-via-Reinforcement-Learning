 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 4:50 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC line is now
 better visualized.  The tip projects over the mild-to-low SVC.  There is no
 evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.  Otherwise, the chest
 radiograph is unchanged in appearance.
