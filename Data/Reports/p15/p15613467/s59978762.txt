                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged, with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again
 noted.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no pulmonary
 edema is identified.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis versus chronic interstitial abnormality, as seen on the prior
 study.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, with chronic blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle suggestive of pleural thickening.  Degenerative
 changes are noted in both glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints, as well
 as at multiple levels within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly reflecting
 atelectasis though a chronic interstitial abnormality is not excluded. 
 Findings appear similar compared to the prior exam, and repeat radiographs can
 be obtained with improved inspiratory effort for clearer assessment of the
 lung bases.
