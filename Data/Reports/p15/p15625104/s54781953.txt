                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypercarbic respiratory distress, now s/p
 intubation // ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New endotracheal tube ends 3.3 cm from the carina.  The left-sided PICC line
 now ends within the right subclavian vein. A left-sided midline drain is in
 place.  Persistent opacification of the left hemithorax is essentially
 unchanged, with scattered air bronchograms in the left upper lobe.
 Cross-sectional imaging could further delineate the relative contributions of
 consolidation, collapse, and pleural effusion, though collapse is likely the
 dominant process causing the leftward mediastinal shift. Right-sided mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion has increased slightly. Enteric tube passes
 below the diaphragm and outside of the field of view within a decompressed
 stomach.
