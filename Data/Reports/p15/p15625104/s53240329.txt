                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with LLL partial collapse (chronic) and
 superimposed left HCAP.  // ? interval change in consolidations
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lung is still entirely airless. Apparent micro nodularity in the right
 lung could be vascular engorgement, but real pulmonary nodules, such as
 metastases, or dilated vessels on end could be responsible.  There has been
 mild pulmonary edema intermittently.  That has largely cleared from the right
 lower lung.  Heart size is indeterminate because of leftward shift into the
 opacified hemi thorax.  There is no pneumothorax.
