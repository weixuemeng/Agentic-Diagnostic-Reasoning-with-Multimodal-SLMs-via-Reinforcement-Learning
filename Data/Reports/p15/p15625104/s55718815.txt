                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated  // ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube is unchanged, ending 3.7 cm from the carina.  The
 enteric tube passes below the diaphragm outside of the field of view within a
 decompressed stomach.  The left-sided PICC line ends in the low SVC.
 Opacification of the left hemithorax is unchanged, likely a combination of
 effusion, consolidation, and collapse. Right-sided pulmonary edema is mild.
 The small to moderate right pleural effusion and associated compressive
 atelectasis has increased slightly. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. All lines and tubes in standard position.
 2. Unchanged left hemithorax opacification.
 3. Mild right-sided pulmonary edema, and slightly increased small to moderate
 right pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis.
