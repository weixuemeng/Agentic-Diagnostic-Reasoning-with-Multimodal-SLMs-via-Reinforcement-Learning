                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chronic left lower lobe collapse and left
 upper lobe pneumonia s/p chest PT  // eval for interval change in left lower
 lobe
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A nearly air less left lung is unchanged since at least ___, the
 earliest radiograph currently available. Air bronchograms are consistently
 present in the left upper lobe, but not an the lower and the lower lobe
 bronchus has been consistently opacified. Bronchial obstruction is presumed.
 Nodulation in the right midlung suggests bronchopneumonia as well .
 Mediastinum is markedly shifted into the left hemi thorax making it impossible
 to assess heart size. A large volume of the right lung suggests emphysema. No
 pneumothorax.
