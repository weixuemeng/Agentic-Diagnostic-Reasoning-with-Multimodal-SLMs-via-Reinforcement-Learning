                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD, chronic left lung collapse and
 recurrent PNA s/p bronchoscopy and suction of seretions  // improvement of L
 lung collapse
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent opacification of the left hemithorax with leftward
 mediastinal shift suggesting collapse of the left lower lobe. A large left
 pleural effusion is unchanged. Compared with the immediate prior study of ___ at 22:23, there is slightly improved aeration of the left
 mainstem bronchus as well as slightly increased air in the left lung field.
 However, the partially visualized left-sided airways appear abnormal,
 suggesting widespread bronchiectasis.  The pulmonary edema in the right lung
 appears slightly improved, but there abnormal opacities throughout the right
 lung, suggesting underlying chronic pulmonary disease.  If no cross-sectional
 imaging has been performed to date
 (none is available for review at this time), CT is recommended for further
 evaluation of any underlying parenchymal process. The endotracheal tube and
 enteric tube are in unchanged standard position. There are multilevel age
 indeterminate vertebral compression fractures of the visualized thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent opacification of the left hemithorax with leftward mediastinal
 shift suggesting left lower lobe collapse.
 2. Slightly improved aeration of the left mainstem bronchus.
 3. Bronchiectatic left-sided airways, and an abnormal right lung field, for
 which a chest CT is recommended if outside studies are not available for
 review.
