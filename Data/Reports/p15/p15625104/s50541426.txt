 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD and left lung collapse, that required
 intubation. now s/p intubation  // placement of ETT
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the very extensive consolidations in
 the left lung have further increased, causing near total opacification of the
 left hemi thorax, associated to substantial volume loss.  The tip of the
 endotracheal tube is within 1 cm of the carinal and should be pulled back by
 approximately 2 cm.  The position of the left PICC line is constant. On the
 right, the apical parenchymal opacity is unchanged in extent and distribution.
