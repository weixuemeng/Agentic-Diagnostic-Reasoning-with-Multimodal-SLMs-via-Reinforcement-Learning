                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax. No contralateral shift
 of the mediastinal structures is demonstrated indicating that this is
 compatible with left lung collapse. A few air bronchograms are noted in the
 left lung. Within the right lung, there appears to be mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion without focal consolidation.  The right lung is hyperinflated with
 probable emphysematous changes. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen on
 the right. There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures with
 multiple compression deformities noted in the imaged thoracic spine of
 indeterminate age.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Complete opacification of the left hemithorax compatilble with collapse.
 Coexisting infection is not excluded. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion in
 the right lung. Multiple thoracic compression fractures.
