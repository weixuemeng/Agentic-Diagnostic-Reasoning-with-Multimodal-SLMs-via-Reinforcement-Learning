  Interval decrease in moderate left pleural effusions status post
  thoracentesis.  Opacity in the left lower lung likely represents a combination
  of effusion and atelectasis though superimposed infection is possible.  There
  is mild pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with decompensated Cirrhosis s/p thoracentesis
 and paracentesis  // Evaluation for effusion, PTx and pneumonia/atelectasis   
 Evaluation for effusion, PTx and pneumonia/atelectasis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, following thoracentesis there has
 been substantial decrease in the left pleural effusion, though residual fluid
 is still present and there is obscuration of the hemidiaphragm consistent with
 volume loss in the left lower lobe.  No evidence of post procedure
 pneumothorax.
 In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to unequivocally
 exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
 Cardiac silhouette is unchanged and there is mild elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure.  There is also evidence of previous cervical fusion
 procedure.
