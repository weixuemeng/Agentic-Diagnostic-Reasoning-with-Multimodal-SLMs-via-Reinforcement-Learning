 aorta demonstrates diffuse calcification and mild tortuosity.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  The right lung is clear.  Left basilar
 compressive atelectasis is noted.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are
 mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  Partially imaged is cervical
 spine fusion hardware.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
