 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/NASH cirrhosis and L hepatic hydrothorax  // Evaluate for
 interval change in hydrothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is the right IJ catheter with the tip terminating in the mid SVC. 
 Heterogeneous right upper lobe parenchymal consolidation is unchanged.  The
 moderate left pleural effusion and atelectasis is unchanged.  Heart size is
 normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  There is cervical stabilization hardware, which appears unchanged in
 comparison to the prior chest radiographs.

 1. Unchanged right upper lobe parenchymal consolidation.
 2.  Unchanged left lower lobe consolidation, likely a combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis, although multifocal pneumonia is possible.
