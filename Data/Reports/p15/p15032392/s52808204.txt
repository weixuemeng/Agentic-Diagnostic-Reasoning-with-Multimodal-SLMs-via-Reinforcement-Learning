                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ NASH cirrhosis c/b variceal bleed, p/w elevated Tbili and
 ___, now s/p OLT ___ post-transplant course c/b stress induced CM, ___,  
 likely ischemic hepatopathy  // eval PNA, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable CXR
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___ at 3:54am
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ETT terminates 2.3cm above the carina.  Right IJ is not changed, terminating
 at the superior cavoatrial junction.  A dobhoff tube can be traced to the
 distal stomach, but the tip is not visualized.  Posterior fusion hardware
 noted in the cervical spine.
 
 Lung volumes are low, which accentuates bronchovascular markings.  No
 consolidations.  Hazy left lung base opacity suggests a layering pleural
 effusion.  No sizeable pleural effusion on the right.  No pneumothorax. 
 Stable cardiomediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Slightly low-lying ETT, 2.3cm above the carina.
 2. Low lung volumes, with probable small left pleural effusion.
