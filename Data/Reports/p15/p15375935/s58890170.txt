                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ as well as a chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with generalized weakness, history of
 recurrent lung cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Patient
 has a history of prior right lower lobectomy.  There is volume loss in the
 right lung with opacity at the right lung base which has been previously
 characterized on prior chest CT with regards to known necrotic tumor.  The
 relative prominence of the right pulmonary hilum is essentially stable from
 prior exam reflecting tumor involvement.  The left lung is clear.  Heart size
 is difficult to characterize due to effacement of the right heart border.  The
 mediastinum appears stable.  Bony structures appear stable with a mid thoracic
 compression deformity again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest with volume loss in the right
 lower lung secondary to prior right lower lobectomy with stable opacity
 characterized previously as necrotic tumor.  No evidence of superimposed
 pneumonia.
