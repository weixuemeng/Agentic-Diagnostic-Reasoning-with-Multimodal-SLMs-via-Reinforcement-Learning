                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with trauma and history of hypoxia.  Evaluate for
 evidence of pneumothorax.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accounting for some bronchovascular crowding.
 Patchy right basiliar opacity could be seen with atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary
 upper zone redistribution suggest pulmonary venous hypertension.  The heart
 appears enlarged, although this study is not tailored for assessment of
 cardiac size.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting slight fluid overload.  Right lower lung
 opacity, not specific, atelectasis versus contusion could be considered.
