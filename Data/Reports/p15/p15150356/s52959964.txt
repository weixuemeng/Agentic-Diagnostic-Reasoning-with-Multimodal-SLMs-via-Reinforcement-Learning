                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated for hypoxia, here to evaluate ET tube placement and
 interval change in lung fields.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___ at 23:08.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating just
 below the level of the thoracic inlet 2.3 cm from the carina.  A nasogastric
 tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view on this image.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette remains enlarged.  Calcification at the aortic
 knob is again noted.  There is increased opacification at the bilateral lung
 bases from the most recent prior study with blunting at the bilateral
 costophrenic angles on the left greater than the right compatible with small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  There is pulmonary vascular congestion and
 edema, which is slightly increased from the most recent prior study.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube and NG tube in appropriate position.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions on the left greater than right.
 3.  Increased pulmonary edema from ___.
