 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are normal.  An opacity projecting just medial to the
 cardiophrenic border may represent a diaphragmatic hernia or paraspinal
 abnormality.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  An opacity projecting just
 medial to the right cardiophrenic border may represent a diaphragmatic hernia
 or paraspinal abnormality.  If no cause for patient's chest pain is found,
 recommend further work up for this finding.
