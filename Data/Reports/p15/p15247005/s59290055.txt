                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Non-responsiveness and syncope.  Pain with breathing.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device is present.  The heart is normal
 in size.  The aortic arch is calcified.  There is a large hiatal hernia with
 an air-fluid level projecting over the lower central mediastinum slightly to
 the right of midline.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Aside
 from streaky opacities, probably relating to the presence of the hernia, the
 lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large hiatal hernia.  In that setting, confluent left infrahilar
 opacity could be seen with associated atelectasis but is not entirely
 specific.  Pneumonia is a differential consideration, however, in the
 appropriate setting.  Correlation to prior radiographs is suggested if
 available.
