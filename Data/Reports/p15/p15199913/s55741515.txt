                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hodgkin's disease, presenting with a pleuritic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the superior vena cava, making a loop
 along its mid course, as seen previously.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is no focal parenchymal opacity.  The left
 costophrenic sulcus is slightly blunted, so there may be a trace pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible trace left-sided pleural effusion, but essentially
 unremarkable examination.
