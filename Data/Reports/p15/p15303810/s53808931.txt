 INDICATION:  Patient with history of seizures and current UTI.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes without
 pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Mild perihilar
 vascular congestion is noted.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.  Small opacities in the left lower lobe best seen on the lateral view
 may reflect aspiration.  Pacemaker leads project over right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Compression deformities of mid thoracic vertebral bodies are
 unchanged.
