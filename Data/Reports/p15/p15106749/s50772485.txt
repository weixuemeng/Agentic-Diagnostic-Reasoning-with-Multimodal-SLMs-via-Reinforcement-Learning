 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NSCLC on oral chemotherapy with erlotinib,
 now with nasal congestion and some cough, no fever.  // pneumonia or effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right lower lobe mass has been more fully characterized by a recent CT. 
 Persistent right lower lobe volume loss, right pleural effusion and pleural
 thickening, similar to frontal scout image of recent CT.  However, when
 today's lateral radiograph is compared to the lateral scout image from the CT
 scan, a subtle area of increased opacity has developed in the right lower lobe
 posteriorly, partially obscuring the right hemidiaphragm.  The left lung is
 clear except for a focal area of linear atelectasis of the left lung base. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  No acute skeletal
 findings.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible right lower lobe pneumonia, best visualized on the lateral
 radiograph.
 
 Right lower lobe mass and pleural disease are grossly unchanged from CT of ___.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 11:14 into the Department of Radiology
 critical communications system for direct communication to the referring
 provider.
