                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post-cholecystectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is normal in size, and cardiomediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  The left
 hemidiaphragm is not visualized reflecting opacification of the left lower
 lobe, likely secondary to atelectasis, but in the appropriate clinical context
 pneumonia should be considered.  Interval development of small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Bibasilar atelectasis
 2. Small bilateral effusions
 3. Left lower base opacification, likely atelectasis, but in the appropriate
 clinical context, pneumonia is possible.
