                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, dyspnea five days post-op, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low.  There is left lower lobe consolidation which is concerning for
 pneumonia, though a component of atelectasis is also likely present.  The
 right lung is clear aside from a linear density in the mid-to-lower lung which
 likely reflects subsegmental linear atelectasis.  The heart size is difficult
 to assess.  Mediastinal contour appears normal.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.  On
 the lateral view, there is note made of gas-distended and mildly dilated loops
 of small bowel, for which clinical correlation is advised.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia and/or
 atelectasis.  Distended loops of small bowel in the upper abdomen seen on the
 lateral view.  Please correlate clinically and dedicated abdominal radiograph
 may be performed to further assess as needed.
