                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with persistent cough and fever.  Left lower
 lobe crackles.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Heterogeneous opacification in the left lower lung, including lower lobe and
 lingula, is considerably more extensive than small regions of peribronchial
 consolidation with a nearly nodular appearance in the right mid lung.  Overall
 findings suggest bilateral pneumonia.
 
 There is no evidence of central adenopathy and no pleural effusion.  Heart
 size is normal.
 
 Findings were discussed by telephone with ___ at 12:45 p.m. when the
 findings were recognized.
 
 Determination of a pathogen is not possible radiographically but because of
 the bilateral nature of disease, mycoplasma infection needs to be added to the
 list of other likely candidates.
