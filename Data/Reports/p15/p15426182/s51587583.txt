                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 5:28
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with disseminated adenovirus infection. 
 Assess for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 9:17.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ 5:28 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube.  A right internal
 jugular central line remains in place with its tip in the mid-to-distal SVC. 
 Lung volumes are diminished and there is diffuse bilateral parenchymal
 abnormality.  There are likely layering effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 appreciated.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess
 given the diffuse airspace process.  When compared to the prior study, the
 airspace process is likely not significantly changed but appears more
 pronounced due to differences in lung volumes.  No pneumothorax.
