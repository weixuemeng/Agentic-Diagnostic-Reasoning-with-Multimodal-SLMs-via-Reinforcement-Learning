                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure from an adenovirus pneumonia.  Evaluate for
 change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT of the chest from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single supine AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, approximately 8
 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip
 out of the field of view.  A right central venous catheter is unchanged with
 the tip in the low SVC.
 
 A right mid and lower lung zone opacity is not significantly changed from the
 prior exam, and likely reflects a combination of the known pneumonia and a
 right pleural effusion.  A retrocardiac opacity is also not significantly
 changed, likely due to atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion.  The
 apices of the lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Flowing osteophytes are noted
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall, no significant change from the prior exam.
