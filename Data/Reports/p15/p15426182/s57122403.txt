                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Disseminated adenovirus.  Evaluate for change in pneumonia and
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.  CT chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in unchanged position, 3.5 cm from the
 carina.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of field
 of view.  The right internal jugular central venous catheter is present with
 the tip in the mid SVC.
 
 Again, there are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, similar to the prior
 exam.  Bilateral, predominantly perihilar interstitial and parenchymal
 opacities are similar to the prior exam.  There is no new opacity.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart size is
 difficult to determine given the adjacent effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change from the prior exam in the bilateral
 opacities and moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
