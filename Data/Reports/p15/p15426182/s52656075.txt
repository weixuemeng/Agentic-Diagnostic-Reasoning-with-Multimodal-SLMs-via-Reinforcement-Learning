                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxemic respiratory failure, disseminated adenovirus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest show continued clearing of right lower lobe
 consolidation, but today, there is greater vascular engorgement suggesting
 cardiac decompensation or mild volume overload.  The region of greatest
 residual pneumonia is probably the middle lobe, best appreciated on the
 lateral view.  Pleural effusions are small.  No pneumothorax.  Right PICC line
 ends in the mid-to-upper SVC.
