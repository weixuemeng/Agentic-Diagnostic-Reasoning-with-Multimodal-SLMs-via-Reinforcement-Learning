 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia, has been on dialysis. 
 Evaluate fluid status.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the previous study from ___.
 
 The endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and right-sided central line are
 unchanged in position.  There has been improvement of the pleural effusion on
 the left side.  There remains a small right-sided pleural effusion.  An area
 of consolidation marginates the inferior minor fissure on the right.  This may
 be partially due to volume loss.  No overt pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces
 are identified.
