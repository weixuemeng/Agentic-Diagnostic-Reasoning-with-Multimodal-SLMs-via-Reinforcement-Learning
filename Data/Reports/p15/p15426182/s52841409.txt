                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Disseminated adenovirus with history of bronchoscopy yesterday, for
 interval change.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studes with the most recent CT Chest from ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Overall, there is little interval change in comparison to the prior study. 
 Endotracheal tube appears in place in mid-trachea.  Right internal jugular
 central venous catheter appears in place with the tip at the lower SVC. 
 Enteric tube traverses to the stomach.
 
 Again noted is persistent left lower lobe collapse and adjacent small to
 moderate pleural effusion.  Right basilar opacities are also again noted and
 likely represent a combination of small pleural effusion and atelectasis. 
 Right middle lobe opacities which may be representative of atelectasis versus
 pneumonia appear stable.  Previously noted mild pulmonary edema appears
 improved at the apices.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild improvement in biapical pulmonary edema with little interval change
 otherwise with persistent bibasilar opacities.
