                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:34 AM, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with disseminated adenovirus, intermittent worsening
 of hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Substantial decrease in mediastinal vascular caliber and volume of now small
 left pleural effusion suggests a component of hemodynamic decompensation has
 reversed.  Large area of consolidation persists in the right lower lobe where
 the process originated.  Left lower lobe opacification, largely residual
 atelectasis, has improved as well.
