                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post bronchoscopy.  Question atelectasis.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable chest radiograph shows an endotracheal tube
 in place approximately 3 cm above the carina, which is slightly lower than was
 seen on the study from earlier the same date.  Gastric tube and right-sided
 PICC appear in unchanged position.  All lung lobes are aerated, and there is
 better aeration in the left retrocardiac region, but some bihilar atelectasis
 persists.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Improved left retrocardiac aeration with some persistent
 perihilar subsegmental atelectasis bilaterally.
