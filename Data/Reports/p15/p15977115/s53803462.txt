                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with chronic COPD and right
 lower lobe small cell cancer after right lower lobe VATS wedge resection after
 chest tube removal.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained on
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly similar in appearance.  Bibasal
 atelectasis is re-demonstrated.  No definitive pneumothorax is seen, but the
 appearance of the left lower lobe might be suggestive of progression of
 atelectasis versus aspiration, attention to this area on the subsequent
 radiograph is required.
