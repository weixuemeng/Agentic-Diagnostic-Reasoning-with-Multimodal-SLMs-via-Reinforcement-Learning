                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with right lower lobe wedge resection. 
 Evaluate lung and chest tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-erect position.  Comparison is made with a preceding pre-operative chest
 examination of ___. Normal heart size but markedly elongated and
 widened thoracic aorta as before.  During the interval, the patient has
 undergone a right VATS procedure with wedge biopsy in the right lower lobe
 area.  A right-sided chest tube has been introduced in the right lower chest
 wall and terminates in the apical area of the right hemithorax.  No
 pneumothorax can be identified.  In the area of the biopsy, a
 triangular-shaped well-demarcated local density is seen apparently
 representing the surgical intervention.  No other pulmonary abnormalities are
 seen.  Noted are relatively high-positioned diaphragms and poor inspirational
 efforts resulting in crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature.  There
 is, however, no progression of significant pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  Chest tube in place, status post wedge
 resection.
