                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:19 A.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with COPD and previous right lower lobe VATS wedge
 resection and mediastinoscopy, chest tube placed, now tachypneic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Since there was mild pulmonary edema following surgery, mediastinal widening
 could be due to vascular engorgement.  On the other hand, some mediastinal
 bleeding is not unexpected after mediastinoscopy.  Pulmonary edema has
 improved, but there is severe bibasilar atelectasis that has worsened.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions may be present.  There is no pneumothorax.  In
 other respects, the mediastinum, specifically the generally dilated and very
 tortuous thoracic aorta is unchanged.  Heart is top normal.  Right apical
 pleural tube unchanged in position.
 
 The stomach is newly distended with air and fluid.
