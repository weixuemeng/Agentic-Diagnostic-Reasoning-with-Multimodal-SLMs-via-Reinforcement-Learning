                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with shortness of breath for six months,
 status post right lung wedge resection, evaluate for postoperative changes
 such as effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest films were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is
 within normal limits.  Rather prominent general dilatation and elongation of
 the thoracic aorta.  Multiple focal wall calcifications most prominent in the
 aortic arch remain unchanged.  No new contour abnormalities have developed. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There is no evidence of
 significant left atrial enlargement as can be judged on the lateral view. The
 on previous examination  seen postoperative scar formations in the right lower
 lobe area have further regressed including the local thickenings of the pleura
 along the lower right lateral chest wall.  There is no evidence of any pleural
 effusion accumulating in either lateral or posterior pleural sinuses.  No
 pneumothorax is seen in the apical area on the frontal view.  Comparison is
 extended to the preoperative PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  Comparison of cardiac structures and pulmonary vasculature does not
 indicate that the patient has developed significant CHF symptoms.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Regression of postoperative scar formations after removal of
 small cell carcinoma.  No evidence of new infiltrates.  No signs of cardiac
 enlargement or pulmonary congestion.  Rather marked general widening of
 thoracic aorta remains stable.
