                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates a tortuous aorta,
 similar to the prior studies.  Cardiac size is top normal.  The lung fields
 demonstrate linear opacities in the lower lobes, likely atelectasis. Chain
 sutures in the right lower lobe is consistent with priot right lower lobe
 wedge resection..  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Linear atelectasis in the lower lobes with no evidence of pneumonia. Tortuous
 aorta is again seen.
