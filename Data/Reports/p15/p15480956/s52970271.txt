  On the lateral radiograph, the right mid lung opacity is localized to the
  lateral segment of the right middle lobe and likely representative of
  pneumonia in the proper clinical setting. However, followup to resolution is
  recommended as a mass cannot be excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Right middle lobe opacity on portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 9:44 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lateral image now shows
 that the right mid lung opacity is localized to the lateral segment of the
 right middle lobe.  This likely represents pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
 
 Resolution should be documented radiographically, given that the presence of a
 central mass cannot be excluded.
 
 No other change.
