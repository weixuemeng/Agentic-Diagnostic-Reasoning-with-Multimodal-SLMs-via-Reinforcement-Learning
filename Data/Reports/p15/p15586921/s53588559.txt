                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Previously seen pneumomediastinum appears to have
 resolved.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.  There is
 no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Calcified bilateral pleural plaques are
 again seen with unchanged pleural thickening and chronic loculated pleural
 effusion within the right lung base and right apex.  Multifocal opacities
 within the left mid lung field peripherally, as well as within both lower lung
 fields appear progressed when compared to the prior radiograph, and the
 opacities in the left lung appear more severe than compared to the prior chest
 CT.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Numerous clips are demonstrated within the
 gastroesophageal region.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Multifocal opacities appear progressed from the previous chest radiograph,
 and slightly increased within the left lung compared to the previous CT. 
 Findings are concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  
 
 2. Chronic calcified bilateral pleural plaques and loculated right pleural
 effusion, compatible with asbestosis, and better assessed on the recent CT.
 
 3. Resolution of the previously noted pneumomediastinum.
