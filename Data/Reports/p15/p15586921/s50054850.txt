                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with severe weight loss, suspected lung carcinoma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 There is a new mass-like region of consolidation in the superior segment of
 the right lower lobe.  Given the history, this could be tuberculosis as well
 as a pyogenic lung abscess, but bronchogenic carcinoma is certainly a
 possibility.  CT scanning should be performed.  Small right pleural effusion
 or thickening is chronic.  Emphysema is severe.  Possible right hilar
 adenopathy, difficult to assess because of the visual overlay of the right
 lower lobe abnormality.  Left pleural scarring is also chronic.  Heart size is
 normal.
 
 Findings were posted to the online record of critical radiology findings for
 direct notification of the referring physician, at the time of approval
