                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and CT chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable
 compared to the prior CT.  Bilateral calcified pleural plaques and pleural
 thickening also appear similar to the prior CT.  However, an irregularly
 marginated nodular opacity in the right lower lobe at the level of the right
 ninth posterior rib with the junction of the right fourth anterior rib appears
 larger than on the prior CT scan, although direct comparison is difficult due
 to modality differences.  However, when compared to a prior chest radiograph
 of ___, this appears to be new.  There are no definite pleural
 effusions.  Bones are diffusely demineralized, in keeping with the patient's
 advanced age.
 
 IMPRESSION:  2.3 cm irregularly marginated right lower lobe nodular opacity
 has apparently increased in size since ___ and is concerning for
 primary lung neoplasm or indolent infection.  Followup chest CT is recommended
 for more complete characterization and to allow more accurate comparison to
 the chest CT of ___, as entered into radiology communications
 dashboard on ___.
