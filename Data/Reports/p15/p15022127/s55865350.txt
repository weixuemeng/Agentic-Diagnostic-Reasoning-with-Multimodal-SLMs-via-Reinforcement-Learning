                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumonia seen on the prior outside radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are low lung volumes
 that may accentuate the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. 
 Atelectatic changes are seen bilaterally, without vascular calcification.  In
 view of the clinical history, the possibility of a left basilar consolidation
 would have to be considered.
