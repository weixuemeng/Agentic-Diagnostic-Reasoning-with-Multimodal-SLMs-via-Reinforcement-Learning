                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough and newly detected leukocytosis  //
 Any new consolidations concerning for PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged. There is upper
 zone redistribution without overt CHF. As before, there are bibasilar
 opacities. These may represent atelectasis, but increased opacity in the lower
 lobe on the lateral view acute difficult to exclude a pneumonic infiltrate.
 Allowing for technical differences, the appearance is probably slightly
 improved compared with ___. No pleural effusion is identified.
 Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution,  similar to the prior film. No
 overt CHF and no effusion.
 2. Bibasilar opacities. Associated pneumonic infiltrate or focus of aspiration
 would be difficult to exclude.
