 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // eval for pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately to severely enlarged. Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement. Patchy opacities within the lower lobes bilaterally may reflect
 areas of atelectasis but aspiration or infection cannot be excluded. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Multilevel degenerative
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect
 atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
