                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with three weeks of cough, now
 productive of dark sputum.  Is there any focal consolidation, vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar study of ___.  Moderate cardiac enlargement
 remains.  The cardiac contours demonstrating a relative prominence of the left
 ventricular contour to the left and posteriorly.  The thoracic aorta is
 moderately widened and elongated as before.  No local contour abnormalities
 are present.  The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an upper zone
 re-distribution, but no evidence of interstitial or alveolar edema.  On the
 left base in retrocardiac space, a crowded pulmonary vasculature is observed
 on the lateral view, partially obscuring the diaphragmatic contour.  The
 lateral view discloses a hazy parenchymal infiltrate occupying the posterior
 segment of the left lower lobe without evidence of coinciding pleural
 effusion.  This local parenchymal density was not present on the lateral view
 of the preceding examination of ___.  Moderate cardiac enlargement
 and the upper zone re-distribution pattern existed already earlier.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate occupying left
 lower lobe posterior segment consistent with the diagnosis of pneumonia. 
 Referring physician, ___. ___ was informed via page at 2:45 p.m.
