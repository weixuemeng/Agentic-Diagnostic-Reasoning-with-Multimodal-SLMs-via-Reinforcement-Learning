                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with new NG tube, evaluate placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Available for comparison is the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.  The on previous examination identified
 right-sided PICC line has been removed.  Appearance of chest is grossly
 unaltered with heart size within normal limits and no acute pulmonary
 abnormalities.  Although the cardiac area is somewhat underpenetrated, one can
 identify an NG tube in the upper portion of the esophagus and reappearance
 just below the diaphragm indicating that the tube has reached well into the
 stomach where it is curled up.  This includes also the side port.  No other
 significant findings on this single chest view examination.
