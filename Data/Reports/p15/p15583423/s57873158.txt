                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough for the past month with pleuritic chest pain. 
 Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The film quality is sub-optimal due to patient motion.  Lung
 volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of
 the pulmonary vasculature.  The lungs are grossly clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size is within normal limits.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
