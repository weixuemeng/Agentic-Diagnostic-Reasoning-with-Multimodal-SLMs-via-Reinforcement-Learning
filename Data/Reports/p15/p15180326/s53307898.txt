                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient intubated with dental abscess, ET placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest x-ray, neck CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 5.4 cm above the carina.  There is mild vascular engorgement due
 to volume overload; this is however a little asymmetry on the left side
 compared to the right side.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  ET tube is in adequate position.
 2.  Mild volume overload.
 3.  Slight asymmetry of lung opacification on the left compared to right
 should be followed up to exclude aspiration or early pneumonia.  
 
 This was discussed with the ICU team.
