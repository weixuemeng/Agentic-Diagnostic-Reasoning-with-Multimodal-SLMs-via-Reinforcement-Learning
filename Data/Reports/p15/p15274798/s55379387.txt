                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 6:55 P.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after fasciotomy and thrombectomy.  Low hematocrit
 and near respiratory arrest.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging:
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is at the thoracic inlet, but the tube is
 angulated and the tip abuts the tracheal wall which may impede its function. 
 No mediastinal widening, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.  Heart is
 moderately enlarged.  Lungs are grossly clear.  Stomach is severely distended
 with air, presumably a function of intubation  attempts.
