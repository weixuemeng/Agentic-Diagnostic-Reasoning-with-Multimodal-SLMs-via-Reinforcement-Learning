                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative oxygen requirement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is increased opacification
 at both bases consistent with pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis
 at the bases.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia
 would be difficult to exclude.
 
 There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, raising the possibility of
 some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
