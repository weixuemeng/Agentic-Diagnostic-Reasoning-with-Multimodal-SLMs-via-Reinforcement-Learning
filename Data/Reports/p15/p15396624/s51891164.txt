                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Global aphasia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Left shoulder radiographs ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is moderately to severely enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and
 diffusely calcified.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Interstitial
 opacities in the lung bases may either reflect atelectasis and/or chronic
 changes.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 There appears to be subluxation of the glenohumeral joints bilaterally with
 degenerative changes which appear chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild interstitial opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of either
 atelectasis and/or chronic changes.
