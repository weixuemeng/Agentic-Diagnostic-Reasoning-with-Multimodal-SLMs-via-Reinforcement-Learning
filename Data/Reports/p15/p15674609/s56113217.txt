  ET tube in satisfactory position.  There has been interval removal of the
  enteric tube.  A tube is coiled projecting over the hypopharynx.  If an
  enteric tube is in place, it is malpositioned.  If no enteric tube is placed
  this may be external to the patient.  Compared to the study done 3 hr prior
  there is significant decrease in left effusion with improved aeration of the
  left lung.  Swan-Ganz and chest and mediastinal drains are in expected
  position.  Telephone notification regarding the questionable malpositioned

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pre-operation for bleeding, to assess for lines and tubes.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal
 tube tip lies approximately 2.7 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is
 coiled on the hypopharynx.  Left chest tube is in place with no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 
 Continued low lung volumes with increased opacification at the left base
 consistent with some combination of pleural effusion and volume loss in the
 left lower lobe.  There is probably some element of elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.
