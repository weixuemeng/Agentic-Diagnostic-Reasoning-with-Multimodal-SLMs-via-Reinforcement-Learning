                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG, to assess for hemothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there are
 lower lung volumes with extensive opacification within the left hemithorax. 
 This could well represent the hemothorax considered clinically.  There also is
 volume loss in the left lung.  Monitoring and support devices remain in place
 and the right lung is essentially clear.
 
 There is increased widening of the mediastinum with indistinct margins.  This
 could be a manifestation of mediastinal bleeding.
