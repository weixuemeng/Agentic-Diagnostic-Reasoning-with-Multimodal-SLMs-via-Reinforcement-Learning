                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post bilateral iliofemoral endarterectomy and stent placement
 for claudication, now with malaise, fevers. Question consolidation, effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 Lordotic positioning.  There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this,
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged compared with the
 pre-op film dated ___.  Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette
 likely relates to low inspiratory volumes, though some unfolding of the aorta
 may very well be present.  Allowing for low inspiratory volumes, no overt CHF,
 focal infiltrate or effusion is detected.  Minimal atelectasis at both bases
 is present.  Incidental note is made of a large focus of hydroxyapatite
 adjacent to the right humeral head consistent with calcific tendinitis.
