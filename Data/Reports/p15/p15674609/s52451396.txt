                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Sternal wires are unchanged in alignment and configuration compared
 to the most recent radiograph of ___, but the lowest sternal
 wire demonstrates an apparent change in orientation when compared to the first
 two postoperative radiographs of ___ at 1:30 p.m. and 6:02 p.m. 
 However, it is similar to the third postoperative radiograph of that date and
 subsequent radiographs through ___.  There is no evidence of a
 wire fracture or definite migration.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in
 the postoperative period.  Partial atelectasis of the right upper lobe appears
 slightly improved and bibasilar retrocardiac atelectasis is also slightly
 better in the interval.  Small pleural effusions are unchanged, and there is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Apparent change in orientation of lowest sternal wire when compared to
 earliest postoperative radiographs of ___.  Although less
 specific than sternal wire migration, this finding can be a sign of sternal
 dehiscence, and correlation with physical exam findings in this region may be
 helpful.
 
 2.  Improving multifocal atelectasis and persistent small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
