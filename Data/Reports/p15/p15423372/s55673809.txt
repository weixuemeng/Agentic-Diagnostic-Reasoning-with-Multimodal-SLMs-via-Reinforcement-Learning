                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with abdominal pain.  Rule out free air.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  There is volume loss in the right side.  A rib resection is also
 evident here.  The lung parenchyma is relatively normal.  Multiple lucencies
 are identified projected over the right upper quadrant, different from the
 appearance on ___, but the appearances here are mostly suggestive
 of bowel loops, and there is no definitive evidence of free air.  Note the
 complex history of esophageal and lung carcinomas.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Findings suggest bowel loops in the right lower quadrant rather
 than free air, but if there is strong clinical concern for same, a CT could be
 arranged.  Extensive post-operative changes and volume loss in the right side.
 The lungs appear grossly clear.
