 small pleural effusion, in addition to postsurgical changes seen following
 right upper and middle lobectomies.  Again seen is a posterior right rib
 resection, stable in appearance.  There is no new, focal consolidation,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The heart is normal in size.  Mediastinal
 contours are stable.
