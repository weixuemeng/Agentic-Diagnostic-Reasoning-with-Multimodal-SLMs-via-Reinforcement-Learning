                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post esophagectomy, evaluate
 interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 AP portable single view chest examination of ___.  The previously
 described right-sided chest tube remains in place seen to terminate in apical
 area of the right hemithorax.  Right-sided paravertebral structures are also
 air-containing most likely represent moderately air-distended esophageal
 reconstruction.  Attenuated appearance of hyperexpanded right lower lobe lung
 tissue status post right upper and middle lobectomies.  No remaining
 pneumothorax can be identified.  The on previous examination persistent rather
 prominent chest wall emphysema has been reduced to minute remnants.  Elevation
 of right hemidiaphragm as before, but no evidence of any significant pleural
 effusion in the lateral or posterior pleural sinus.  Left-sided hemithorax
 remains unremarkable as before.  The heart size is within normal limits and
 there is no evidence of any pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Regression of previously described postoperative changes, chest
 tube remains in place without evidence of persistent pneumothorax and no new
 pulmonary abnormalities.
