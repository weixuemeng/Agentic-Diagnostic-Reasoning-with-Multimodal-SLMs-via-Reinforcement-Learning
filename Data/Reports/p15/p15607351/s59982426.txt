                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with ST depression on EKG.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits. Heavy pericardial
 calcification might be contributing to EKG abnormality. There is no
 mediastinal venous distension to suggest restrictive pericarditis. The aorta
 is moderately tortuous.  The lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen represent
 prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
