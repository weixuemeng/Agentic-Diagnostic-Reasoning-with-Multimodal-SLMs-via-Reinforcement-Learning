                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of small cell lung cancer with palpitation, evaluate for
 focal infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  A 2.9 x 1.9 cm rounded opacity is
 again seen at the right lung base consistent with known carcinoma.  Smaller
 satellite nodules are not reliably assessed by radiograph.
 
 There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or new focal airspace
 consolidations.  The mediastinal contours appear similar to the prior CT
 chest.  The heart size is normal.
