 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right posterior rib pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  When compared to prior, there has been no
 significant interval change.  Again seen is a right lower lobe lobulated mass

 The lungs are otherwise clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.  No displaced rib
 fractures identified.

 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Unchanged right basilar right lower lobe
