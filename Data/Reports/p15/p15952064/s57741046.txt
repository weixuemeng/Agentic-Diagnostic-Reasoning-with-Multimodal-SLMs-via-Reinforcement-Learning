                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath over the last two days.  New syncopal
 episode, for evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 REPORT:
 
 The mediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs are grossly clear.  Bilateral
 symmetrical rounded opacities presumptively reflect nipple shadows, seen on
 the PA view.
 
 There are multilevel degenerative osteophytes identified in the spine.  No
 good evidence of fracture or acute findings.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary findings.  No additional findings of note.Repeat with
 nipple markers could be performed if there is concern for malignancy
