                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with end-stage renal disease on
 hemodialysis.  Requires chest examination to become acceptable as outpatient
 at hemodialysis center.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  Moderate
 cardiac enlargement without typical configurational abnormality.  Unremarkable
 appearance of thoracic aorta and mediastinal structures.  The pulmonary
 vasculature demonstrates an upper zone redistribution pattern, but there is no
 evidence of interstitial or alveolar edema.  No pleural effusion is seen in
 the lateral or posterior pleural sinuses.  There is no evidence of any acute
 or chronic pulmonary parenchymal abnormality and no evidence of pneumothorax
 in the apical area.  Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly unremarkable. 
 When comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of ___, the heart size has slightly increased.  This coincides with the
 development of an upper zone redistribution pattern suggestive of mild degree
 of chronic left-sided heart failure.  There is no sign of any acute pulmonary
 infection.
