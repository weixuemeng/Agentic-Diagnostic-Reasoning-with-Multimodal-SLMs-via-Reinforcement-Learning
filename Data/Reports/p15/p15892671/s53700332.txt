                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Increased shortness of breath, uses home O2.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been no significant interval change since the prior study.  Again, there are
 relatively low lung volumes and mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Interstitial
 opacities in the mid-to-lower lung fields are stable consistent with known
 interstitial lung disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.
