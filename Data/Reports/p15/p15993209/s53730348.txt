                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cavitary pneumonia.  // Assess for response
 to 8 weeks of antibiotics.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   Sequential chest radiographs obtained ___ ; ___ chest CTA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The focal peripheral left lower lobe opacity appears unchanged compared to ___ chest x-ray.  There is mild improvement of the small left pleural
 effusion.  Linear atelectasis are noted in the left lung bases.  The right
 lung is fully expanded and clear.  Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Although there is significant improvement of the  left lower lobe
 consolidation when compared to the ___ CXR; in comparison to the more
 recent ___ CXR, focal peripheral left lower lobe opacification is
 unchanged.  This could potentially represent a localized area organizing
 pneumonia or developing scar, but is not fully characterized by conventional
 chest radiographs.
 
 Slight improvement of small left pleural effusion.
