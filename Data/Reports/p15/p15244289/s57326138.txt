 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided pleural effusion has increased substantially and is
 now large with associated parenchymal opacification, not specific but
 compatible with atelectasis.  There is no net shift of mediastinal structures.
 The left lung remains clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative
 changes are similar along the thoracic spine.  Cholecystectomy clips project
 over the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing right-sided pleural effusion.
