 HISTORY:  Status post right thoracentesis.  Question pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A pleural effusion on the right has markedly decreased in size. 
 There is still a small right-sided pleural effusion, however.  There has been
 partial expansion of the right lung with residual streaky opacities suggesting
 atelectasis.  There is no evidence for pneumothorax.  The left lung remains
 clear.  An interstitial abnormality has improved.  There is a similar mild
 thoracolumbar compression deformity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked decrease in right-sided pleural effusion.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Resolution of pulmonary congestion.
