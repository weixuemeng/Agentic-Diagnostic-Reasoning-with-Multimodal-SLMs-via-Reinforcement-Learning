                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath for 2 weeks.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval increase in right-sided pleural effusion, which may be
 partially loculated, with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation
 cannot be excluded.  Overall there are low lung volumes.  Perihilar opacities
 may relate to pulmonary edema.  Patchy left base opacity may be related to
 atelectasis versus developing consolidation.  No left pleural effusion is
 seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The right aspect of the cardiac
 silhouette cannot be adequately assessed due to adjacent opacity. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Significant increase in right-sided pleural effusion, which may be partially
 loculated, with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded. 
 Perihilar opacities may also relate to underlying pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 left base opacity may be due to atelectasis or developing consolidation.
