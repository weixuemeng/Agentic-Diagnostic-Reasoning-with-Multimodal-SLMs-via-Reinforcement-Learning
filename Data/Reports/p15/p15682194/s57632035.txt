 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 3:08 PM
  IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.  Right
  hilar/infrahilar prominence which could potentially represent early infection,
  alternative considerations include vascular confluence, adenopathy, or
  underlying mass lesion.  Short-term followup imaging is recommended following
  appropriate treatment to exclude above-mentioned entities.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old male with fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal heart
 size and mediastinal contour.  There is prominent right hilar/infrahilar
 opacity which could represent confluence of vascular structures, but can
 potentially represent early infection or even potentially a mass.  A mild
 interstitial prominence suggests there may be mild congestion.  There is no
 pneumothorax or large effusion.  There is trace if any dependent atelectasis. 
 Multilevel thoracic spondylosis is present.
