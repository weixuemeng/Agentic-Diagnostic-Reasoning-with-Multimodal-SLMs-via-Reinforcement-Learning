                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage with a fever.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the chest from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position 4.6 cm from the
 carina.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of field
 of view.  A left-sided PICC is present with the tip in the mid SVC.
 
 There is a retrocardiac opacity with associated volume loss.  This is likely
 due to left lower lobe atelectasis.  There is likely a small associated
 pleural effusion.  The remainder of the lungs are clear.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  There is no right pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity is likely a combination of left lower lobe
 collapse and a small amount of pleural fluid.
