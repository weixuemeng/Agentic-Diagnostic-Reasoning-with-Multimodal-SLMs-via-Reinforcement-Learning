 focal consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  No overt pulmonary edema is
 seen.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG, with the cardiac
 silhouette top normal to mildly enlarged and the aorta calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Trace left pleural effusion with overlying left basilar
 atelectasis.
