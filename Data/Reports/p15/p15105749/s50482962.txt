                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pleural masses after
 thoracoscopy.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right chest tube is in place.  The opacities in the right mid and lower
 lung are re-demonstrated and most likely reflect a combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  Left lung is essentially clear.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
