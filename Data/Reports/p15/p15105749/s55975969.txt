                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and weakness.  History of metastatic lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided chest tube has been removed.  There is increasing
 opacification of the right lung base with more patchy heterogeneous opacity
 situated in the right mid lung.  There is mild leftward shift of mediastinal
 structures associated with this appearance that appears new or increased since
 the prior examination.  Aside from vague opacities in the left mid to lower
 lung which may be due to atelectasis or mild fluid overload, the left lung
 remains essentially clear.  A substantial component of opacification in the
 right hemithorax is potentially due to pleural effusion, possibly with
 loculations.  Enlargement of the right paratracheal stripe, immediately above
 the carina suggests that there may be increasing lymphadenopathy, but
 difficult to compare to the prior studies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Increased opacification in the right hemithorax with leftward mass effect
 and concern for new right mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Findings may include a
 pleural effusion on the right, but the appearance is not well assessed with
 radiography.  If needed clinically, chest CT may be helpful to evaluate
 further.  
 
 2.  Vague opacities in the left mid to lower lung, not specific, but mild
 fluid overload could be considered with atelectasis.
