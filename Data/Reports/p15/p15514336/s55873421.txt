 Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes.  There

 effusions.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart is mildly
 enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is mild pulmonary edema, minimally
 progressed since prior.  Post-surgical changes related to the sternotomy wires
 and CABG are again noted.  Multiple surgical clips are again seen projecting
 over right axilla.  Partial imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
