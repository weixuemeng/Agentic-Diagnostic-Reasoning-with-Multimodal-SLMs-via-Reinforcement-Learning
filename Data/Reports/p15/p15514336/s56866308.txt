                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o M with recent CT demonstrating ischemia of the bowel, who
 presents for evaluation of free air. Hx of abdominal pn.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ performed at 2:54 am; CT
 abdomen and pelvis from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  The mild bilateral pulmonary edema is stable compared to the prior
 exam.  There are no pleural effusions, or evidence of a pneumothorax. There
 appears to be an interval increase in the left lower lobe atelectasis, however
 no other new focal consolidations are seen. Again seen are post-surgical
 changes related to the sternotomy wires and CABG.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. No evidence of subdiaphragmatic free air, however, this is not an upright
 film and therefore has a lower sensitivity for abdominal free-air. If there is
 further clinical concern, an upright or decubitus view of the abdomen would be
 more sensitive. 
 
 2. Unchanged mild bilateral pulmonary edema.
