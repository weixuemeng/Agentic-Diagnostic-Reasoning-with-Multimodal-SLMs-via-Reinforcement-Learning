 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever and a history of renal transplantation.

 Although heart size is normal and mediastinal veins are not dilated, pulmonary
 vasculature is generally mildly or recurrently engorged.  That is the case
 today and therefore the new unequivocal interstitial abnormality in the mid
 and lower lung zones is more likely edema and possibly cardiogenic.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged.
