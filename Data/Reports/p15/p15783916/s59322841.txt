                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough, chills, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart size is
 top normal with slight prominence of the main pulmonary artery.  There is
 subtle opacity obscuring the left CP angle on the frontal view which has no
 correlate opacity on the lateral view and is therefore of doubtful clinical
 significance.  Otherwise, no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Top normal heart size with prominence of the main pulmonary
 artery which could reflect pulmonary arterial hypertension for which clinical
 correlation is advised.  No definite evidence of pneumonia.
