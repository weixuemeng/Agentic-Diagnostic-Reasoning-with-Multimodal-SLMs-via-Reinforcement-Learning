 Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The mediastinal contours are
 stable.  Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries is compatible with underlying
 pulmonary arterial hypertension, unchanged.  There is mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema, with a small right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  Minimal atelectasis is also demonstrated in the lung bases. 
 Renal osteodystrophy is again noted within the imaged thoracic spine.
