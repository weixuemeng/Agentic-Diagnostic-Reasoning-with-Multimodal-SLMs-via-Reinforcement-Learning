 HISTORY:  Cough and low-grade fever for 1 week.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart remains moderately enlarged.  Dense mitral annular calcifications
 are re- demonstrated, and there is unchanged enlargement of the main pulmonary
 artery.  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement appears slightly improved
 compared to the prior study.  Aeration of the lung bases is also improved.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified, though there is trace
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle laterally.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, slightly improved when compared to the
 prior exam.  Improved aeration of the lung bases with resolution of the
 previously noted bibasilar airspace opacities.
