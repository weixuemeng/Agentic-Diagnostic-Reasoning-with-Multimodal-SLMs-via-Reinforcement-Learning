                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with end-stage renal
 disease, on hemodialysis and bradycardia and altered mental status.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___
 obtained at 04:04 a.m.
 
 The current study demonstrates substantial interval improvement of pulmonary
 edema, currently mild to moderate with persistent small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged as well as dilated pulmonary arteries
 most likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  There is no pneumothorax.
 The right internal jugular line tip terminates at the level of low
 SVC/cavoatrial junction.
