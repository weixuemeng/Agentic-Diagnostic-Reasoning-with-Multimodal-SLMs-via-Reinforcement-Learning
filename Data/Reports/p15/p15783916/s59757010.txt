                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  O2 sats in ___s with unclear etiology.  Evaluate for any acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ and ___.  CTA chest
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the hemidiaphragms. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The main pulmonary artery contour is
 enlarged, also unchanged.  There are bibasilar airspace opacities with air
 bronchograms which may be seen in the setting of atelectasis or consolidation.
 There is bronchial cuffing in the perihilar regions, perihilar opacities and
 fluid in the fissures suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  There may
 be small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar airspace opacities with air bronchograms may reflect atelectasis
 or consolidation.
 2.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 3.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly and enlargement of the pulmonary artery.
