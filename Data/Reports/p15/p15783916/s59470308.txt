                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  End stage renal disease on hemodialysis, CHF last complaining of
 increased jitteriness, lethargy and increased lower extremity edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest. 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a small right pleural effusion.  Relatively low lung volumes are seen
 with minimal elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Prominence of the
 pulmonary vasculature bilaterally may be due to fluid overload.  Patchy right
 basilar opacity is seen which could in part relate to prominent vasculature,
 underlying consolidation may be present.  No left pleural effusion is seen. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Prominence of the main pulmonary artery is again
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
