                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged but unchanged.  Mediastinal contours
 are relatively stable.  There is moderate pulmonary edema with perihilar
 alveolar opacities present, new from the prior.  A moderate size right pleural
 effusion is increased in size compared to the prior exam. Small left pleural
 effusion is likely present. Bibasilar opacities, with more focal opacification
 in the right lung base, could reflect compressive atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute bony findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New moderate pulmonary edema with moderate size right pleural
 effusion,increased in size compared to the prior study, and patchy bibasilar
 opacities likely reflective of compressive atelectasis. Small left pleural
 effusion also noted.
