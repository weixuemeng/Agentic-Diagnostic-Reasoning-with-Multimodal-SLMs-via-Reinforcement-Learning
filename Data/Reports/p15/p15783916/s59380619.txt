                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Neck and back pain, hypoxic.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There is moderate enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette which is stable.  The mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  The pulmonary vascularity is mildly engorged suggesting an element
 of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  No consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified, though the left costophrenic angle is excluded
 from the field of view.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
