                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including marked
 enlargement of the main pulmonary artery contour.  Fissures are thickened. 
 There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Parenchymal findings,
 which include a mild interstitial abnormality and an indistinct appearance to
 pulmonary vasculature, suggest pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Imaging findings suggesting mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, atypical pneumonia could be considered if
 clinical findings are not suggestive of congestive heart failure.
