                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left arm numbness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is a streaky retrocardiac opacity, which is is likely
 explained by minor atelectasis.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky retrocardiac opacity, probably attributable to
 atelectasis, but if pulmonary symptoms are present, short-term follow-up
 radiographs may be helpful if needed.
