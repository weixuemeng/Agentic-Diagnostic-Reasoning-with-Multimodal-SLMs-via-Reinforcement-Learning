 PORTABLE CHEST X-___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Large right and moderate
 left pleural effusions are again demonstrated, with adjacent mid and lower
 lung opacities, which probably reflect atelectasis.
