                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, tracheostomy and altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus.  The heart size is difficult to
 assess given the presence of bilateral pleural effusions, but is likely mildly
 enlarged.  Tracheostomy tube remains in unchanged position.  Mild pulmonary
 edema is similar compared to the prior study, but increasing bilateral pleural
 effusions are noted, moderate to large on the right, and small on the left. 
 Dense opacification in both lung bases likely reflect atelectasis though
 infection is difficult to exclude.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with increasing bilateral pleural effusions, moderate to
 large on the right and small on the left.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect compressive atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.
