                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia  // Eval for infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Lung volumes are markedly low
 limiting assessment.  There is a retrocardiac opacity containing an air-fluid
 level compatible with a large hiatal hernia.  There is subtle left lower lung
 hazy opacity which is potentially concerning for pneumonia or aspiration.  The
 right lung appears relatively clear.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Heart size is difficult to assess.  Mediastinal contour appears
 prominent likely due to technique.  No acute bony abnormality seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large hiatal hernia, left mid to lower lung hazy opacity concerning for
 pneumonia or aspiration.
