                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/productive cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Mild leftward deviation
 of the trachea at the level of the thoracic inlet with prominence of the right
 superior mediastinal contour may reflect a thyroid goiter, not substantially
 changed from prior.  Lungs are hyperinflated but clear without focal
 consolidation.  No pulmonary vascular congestion or pneumothorax is present. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle on the lateral view is compatible with
 a small pleural effusion.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Small left pleural effusion.
 2. Leftward deviation of the trachea with prominence of the right superior
 mediastinal contour could be due to a thyroid goiter, but not grossly changed
 in the interval.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
