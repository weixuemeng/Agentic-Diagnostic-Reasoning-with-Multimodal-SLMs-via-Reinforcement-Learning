                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Concern for PICC migration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph, the right upper extremity PICC line has slightly
 migrated proximally, terminating just below the expected location of the
 cavoatrial junction. Bilateral perihilar atelectasis is slightly improved
 since the prior study.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 normal and lungs are essentially clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided PICC line terminates just below the cavoatrial junction, slightly
 retracted from the prior study.
