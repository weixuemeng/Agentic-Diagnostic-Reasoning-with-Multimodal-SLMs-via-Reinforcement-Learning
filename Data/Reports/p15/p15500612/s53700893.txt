 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:10 PM
  Right PICC with the tip at the cavoatrial junction.  The lung volumes are low.
  Linear opacities at the bilateral bases are likely atelectasis.  A more focal
  opacity in the lower lung zone along the right heart border is more
  conspicuous than on the prior exam, though does not have a definite correlate
  on the lateral view.  This may represent atelectasis or early infection. 
  There is a small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
