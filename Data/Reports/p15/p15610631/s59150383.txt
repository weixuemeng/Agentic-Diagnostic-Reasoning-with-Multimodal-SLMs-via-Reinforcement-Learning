                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with vomiting for two days, weight
 loss.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A subtle 4-5
 mm somewhat rounded opacity projecting over the left mid lung may be
 artifactual, although underlying pulmonary nodule is not excluded.  The right
 lung is clear.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle 4-5 mm focal opacity projecting over the left mid lung may
 be artifactual due to overlying structures.  However, underlying pulmonary
 nodule is not excluded.  Recommend further evaluation with shallow obliques or
 nonurgent chest CT.
