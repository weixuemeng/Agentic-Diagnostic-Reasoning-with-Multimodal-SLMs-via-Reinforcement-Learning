                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG with bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 There is a left internal jugular venous catheter terminating in the superior
 vena cava, unchanged.  The heart is again mild to moderately enlarged.  There
 is a very small pleural effusion on the right.  Opacification of the lower
 left hemithorax has increased substantially and includes a retrocardiac
 opacity with air bronchograms that is likely compatible with atelectasis; a
 small to moderate pleural effusion probably coincides.  There is also a small
 pleural effusion on the right.  Fissures appear mildly thickened.  There is no
 evidence for parenchymal edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left than right, with
 increased left basilar opacity, not specific, although most frequently
 attributable to atelectasis.  No evidence for parenchymal edema.
