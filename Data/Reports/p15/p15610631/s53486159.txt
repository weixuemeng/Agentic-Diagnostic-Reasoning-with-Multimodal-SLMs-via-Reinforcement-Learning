                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with syncope  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right lung is essentially clear. A moderate loculated left pleural
 effusion is again noted with left retrocardiac opacity, likely representing
 atelectasis, similar to the prior study.  There is no right pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Hilar prominence is consistent with pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Pacemaker device
 is present with leads terminating in unchanged positions.  Median sternotomy
 wires are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Essentially unchanged appearance of the left hemi thorax with moderate
 loculated effusion and probable compressive lower lobe atelectasis.
 2.  Mild vascular congestion.
