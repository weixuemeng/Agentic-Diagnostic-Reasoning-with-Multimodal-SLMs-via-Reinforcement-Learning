                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with abd pain concerning for appendicitis vs
 cholecystitis  // preop CXR/ please confirm R port-a-cath Surg: ___
 (possible appendectomy)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  No priors available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath whose distal tip projects over the
 approximate location of the right atrium, though precise localization of tip
 is limited given poor inspiratory effort and low lung volumes. It is
 recommended to obtain repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory effort if
 possible.
 
 There is a slightly widened appearance of the cardio mediastinal silhouettes,
 likely secondary to lung volumes. There is diffuse bilateral opacification of
 both lungs secondary to mild pulmonary edema as well as vascular/interstitial
 crowding in the setting of low lung volumes. There is retrocardiac
 opacification and obscuring of the left heart border and left hemidiaphragm
 suggesting left lower lobe atelectasis.
 
 There is blunting of the left CP angle consistent with small left pleural
 effusion. The right CP angle is not well visualized. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Right Port-A-Cath with distal tip projecting over right atrium. Recommend
 repeat radiograph with improved inspiration.
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 3.  Left lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings regarding positioning of right-sided
 Port-A-Cath tip was discussed over the phone with ___ by Dr. ___
 on ___ at 10:20, at the time of discovery.  It was recommended at
 that time to obtain repeat radiograph with improved inspiration for improved
 localization of tip.
