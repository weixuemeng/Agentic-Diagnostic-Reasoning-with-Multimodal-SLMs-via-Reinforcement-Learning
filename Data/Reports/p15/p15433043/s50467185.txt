 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p open chole with intermittant desaturation. 
 // pneumonia vs. volume overload
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.  Port-A-Cath tip again seen residing in
 the low SVC or cavoatrial junction. Lung volumes are markedly low. Allowing
 for low lung volumes, there is no overt evidence for pneumonia, CHF, large
 effusion or pneumothorax. There is presumably left basilar
 In the setting of low lung volumes, basilar atelectasis is likely present. The
 heart size cannot be assessed. The mediastinal contour is stable. Bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to low lung volumes with no overt abnormalities. Port-A-Cath
 tip unchanged in the low SVC/cavoatrial junction.
