 ___, and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable upright frontal image of the chest.  
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is again seen, similar to prior exam.  The
 costophrenic angles are not visualized, which may due to technique and
 overlying soft tissues vs pleural effusions.  No focal opacity or mass is
 seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 moderately enlarged, similar prior exam.  Left-sided pacer with intact leads
 in appropriate position is again noted.
