                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with decompensated CHF, new productive cough.  //
 Evaluation of pulm edemea/ vasculature, any infitrate c/f PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 15 30
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, there is been resolution of the CHF.  Mild
 residual upper zone redistribution may be present.  There is minimal patchy
 opacity posteriorly, with patchy opacities in the right cardiophrenic region
 and in the retrocardiac region.  No frank consolidation is identified.  No
 pleural effusion.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, possibly slightly improved. 
 Left-sided 2 lead pacemaker is present, with tips over right atrium and right
 ventricle.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Minimal opacity at both lung bases.  The appearance is compatible with
 bibasilar atelectasis, but the possibility of an early infectious infiltrate
 cannot be excluded.  No frank consolidation.
 2. Marked interval improvement in previously seen CHF findings .
