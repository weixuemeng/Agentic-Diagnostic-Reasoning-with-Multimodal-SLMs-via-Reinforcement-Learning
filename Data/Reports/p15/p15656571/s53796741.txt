                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with known CHF and dilated cardiomyopathy,
 presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Left chest wall pacing device
 seen.  Degree of cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Engorged central pulmonary
 vasculature is again noted.  Please note that motion artifact somewhat limits
 this exam.  However, the lungs are clear of confluent consolidation.  Opacity
 at the costophrenic angles, particularly on the right may be due to overlying
 soft tissues and atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change since prior.  Cardiomegaly and
 probable vascular congestion.
