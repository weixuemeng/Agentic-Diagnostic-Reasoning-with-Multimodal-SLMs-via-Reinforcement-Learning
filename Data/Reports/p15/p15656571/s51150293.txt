                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating in the
 right atrium and right ventricle, respectively, appears unchanged.  The heart
 is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is a very similar pattern of mild interstitial pulmonary vascular
 congestion without significant change.  Fissures appear mildly thickened. 
 Very small persistent pleural effusions are suspected, similar to perhaps
 slightly decreased.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings again consistent with mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, with no findings suggestive of superimposed pneumonia.
