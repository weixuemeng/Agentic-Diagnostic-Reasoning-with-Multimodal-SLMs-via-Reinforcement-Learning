                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post thoracotomy and pacemaker insertion. 
 Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A pacemaker generator overlies the left
 chest wall.  Right atrial and biventricular leads appear in expected position.
 Temporary epicardial pacing leads project over the left ventricle.  There has
 been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter,
 terminating in the upper SVC.  Lung volumes are low, and there is increased
 opacification of the left lung base, suggesting worsening atelectasis and
 pleural effusion.  Opacities in the right lung base appears stable and likely
 reflect atelectasis.  There is no post-procedure pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing left basilar opacity, suggestive of worsening effusion and
 atelectasis.
 2.  No post-procedural pneumothorax.
