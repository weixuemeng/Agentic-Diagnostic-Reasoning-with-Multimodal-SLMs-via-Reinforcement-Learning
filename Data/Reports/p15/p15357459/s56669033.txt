                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and
 currently suspected pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there is interval improvement in the left lower lobe
 aeration with still present consolidation at that location.  Interstitial
 pulmonary edema is present, mild.  Biventricular pacing, one through the
 subclavian approach and one through transthoracic approach is unchanged in
 appearance.  There is an additional left ventricular internal pacer
 demonstrated on both PA and lateral views.  There is no pneumothorax.
