                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, biventricular pacer with worsening
 shortness of breath for 4 days.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left-sided AICD/pacemaker device is again noted with leads terminating in
 the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus.  Epicardial leads are
 also noted.  The heart remains moderate to severely enlarged but stable. 
 Mediastinal contour is unchanged, with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again
 noted.  Calcifications of the thoracic aorta are most pronounced at the arch. 
 The hilar contours are unchanged, with mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 again noted, not significantly changed in the and prior study.  Small left
 pleural effusion which appears to be partially loculated laterally is not
 significantly changed in the interval, with continued retrocardiac opacity
 likely reflective of atelectasis.  The right lung otherwise is grossly clear,
 and no pneumothorax is detected.  There are multilevel degenerative changes of
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, small left pleural effusion, and
 retrocardiac opacity likely atelectasis.  Findings are all similar when
 compared to the prior exam.
