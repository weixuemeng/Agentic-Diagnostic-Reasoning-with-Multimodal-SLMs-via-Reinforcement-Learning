                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left rib pain, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  No focal consolidation is identified. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No definite rib fractures identified. 
 Vertical lucency and slight deformity of the distal end of the right clavicle
 suspicious for a fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs.  No pneumothorax.  If there is persistent clinical
 concern for rib fracture, dedicated rib series may be obtained.
 There is slight deformity of the distal end of the right clavicle, if there is
 localized pain at this site dedicated right clavicular radiographs may be
 obtained to evaluate for an underlying fracture.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Dedicated radiograph of the distal portion of the right
 clavicle to look for a fracture if there is clinical concern, given the
 appearance on this radiograph.  .
