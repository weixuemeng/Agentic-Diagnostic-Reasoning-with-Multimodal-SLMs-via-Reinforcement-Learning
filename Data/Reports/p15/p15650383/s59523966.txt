                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dCMP, LBBB s/___ CRT-P via L axillary vein 
 // pneumothorax      pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 3 transvenous leads originate from the new left pectoral generator.  As far as
 one can tell from a frontal view alone, the tip of one lead ends in the right
 atrium after the lead passes close to the tricuspid valve.  The second lead is
 angulated as it passes the tricuspid valve heading to the floor of the right
 ventricle and there is a left ventricular lead ending close to the apex of the
 heart.
 
 There is no pneumothorax mediastinal widening or pleural effusion.
 
 New heterogeneous peribronchial opacification is present in the supra hilar
 and axillary regions of the right lung which could be asymmetric edema, but
 raise concern for pneumonia.  Minimal interstitial abnormality is present in
 the perihilar left lung, probably residual edema.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Clinical assessment for possible pneumonia.
