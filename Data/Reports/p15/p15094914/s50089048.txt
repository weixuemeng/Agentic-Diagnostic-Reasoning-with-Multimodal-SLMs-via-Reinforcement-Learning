 cardiomegaly.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest x-ray from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable upright exam of the chest.

 unremarkable.  Previously described left lower lung 9-mm lung nodule is not
 well visualized on the prior exam.  No focal consolidations concerning for
 infection, right pleural effusion, or pneumothoraces are identified. Minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle may suggest a trace pleural effusion.
 There is mild stable biapical scarring, overall unchanged compared to the
 prior exam.  There is also a cylindrical radiodense structure projecting over
 the right upper abdomen, likely external to the patient.
