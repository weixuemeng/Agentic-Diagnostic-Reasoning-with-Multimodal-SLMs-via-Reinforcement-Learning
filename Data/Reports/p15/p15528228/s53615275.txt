                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  New patchy and linear
 opacities at the lung bases favor atelectasis, but aspiration and early
 pneumonia are additional considerations for the left lower lobe opacity. 
 There are questionable small pleural effusions bilaterally, but there is no
 visible pneumothorax.
