 There has been interval placement of a feeding tube, which descends beneath
 the diaphragm and appears to have its tip in the proximal jejunum.  There
 continues to be an area of consolidation in the left mid to lower lung which
 has somewhat improved in aeration suggestive of resolving pneumonia.  Right
 lung remains clear.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  No layering
 effusions.  There has been interval removal of the right PICC line.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
