                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with failure to thrive and weight loss, history of
 smoking  // Evaluate for mass
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  The lungs are relatively
 hyperinflated, suggesting underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  If high clinical concern for pulmonary
 lesion, chest CT is more sensitive in detecting subtle lesions.
