                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left-sided pacemaker, evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously placed
 Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed.  In the interval, the patient has
 received a left pectoral pacemaker.  The pacemaker leads show a normal course.
 One lead projects over the right atrium and one over the right ventricle. 
 Minimal right basal atelectasis has developed.  Retrocardiac atelectasis is
 present in unchanged manner.  The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion
 cannot be excluded.  There is currently no evidence of a pneumothorax.
