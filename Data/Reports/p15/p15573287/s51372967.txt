                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with breast cancer, new dyspnea, rales on exam
 ; evaluate for congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior relevant imaging is available on PACs at the time this
 dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperexpanded and hyperlucent with flattening of the
 diaphragms.  Increased opacification of the upper lobes, more so on the right,
 is demonstrated and may reflect radiation change or other parenchymal
 abnormality. No focal consolidation, edema, effusion, or pneumothorax.
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may suggest pleural thickening and/or
 scarring.  The descending aorta slightly tortuous or ectatic.  Diffuse
 calcifications of the trachea mainstem bronchi are within normal limits for
 the patient's age.  Post-surgical changes in the upper mediastinum may reflect
 possible prior surgery, perhaps thyroid.  The heart size is normal.  Moderate
 degenerative changes of the visualized right AC joint is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No focal pneumonia or heart failure.
 2.  Asymmetric increased upper lung opacities, greater on the right -
 recommend further evaluation with a dedicated chest CT.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT to further evaluate asymmetric upper lung
 opacities.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 16:09 into the Department of Radiology critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
