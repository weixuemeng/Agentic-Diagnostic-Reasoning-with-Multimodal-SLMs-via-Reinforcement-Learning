                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with fever and cough.  Suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lungs fully expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and
 pleural surfaces are normal.  Exuberant osteophytes in the thoracic spine lend
 increased radiodensity in that region on the lateral view which should not be
 mistaken for overlying consolidation.
