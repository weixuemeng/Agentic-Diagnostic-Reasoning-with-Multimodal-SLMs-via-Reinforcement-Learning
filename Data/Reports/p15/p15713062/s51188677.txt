 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M s/p assault, now with left sided scapular and rib
 pain  // rib fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are clear.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal silhouette,
 hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.  No pneumothorax, pleural
 effusion, or pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidations are noted.  There are
 no obvious left rib or scapular fractures on this limited exam although this
 study has limited sensitivity for the detection of such.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No evidence of obvious left rib or scapular
 fractures ; however if high clinical concern for such, suggest dedicated
 imaging of the left ribs and/or left scapula.  .
