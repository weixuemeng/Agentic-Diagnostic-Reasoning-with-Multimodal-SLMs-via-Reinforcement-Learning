                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Heart size remains mildly enlarged with a left
 ventricular predominance. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is present. Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 may reflect areas of atelectasis but infection is not excluded. Linear opacity
 within the periphery of the right mid lung field likely reflects subsegmental
 atelectasis.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions are noted. No pneumothorax is
 present. Partially imaged is an inferior vena cava filter within the upper
 abdomen. Mild to mold moderate multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary vascular congestion, small bilateral
 pleural effusions, and patchy opacities in the lung bases, likely atelectasis
 though infection is not excluded.
