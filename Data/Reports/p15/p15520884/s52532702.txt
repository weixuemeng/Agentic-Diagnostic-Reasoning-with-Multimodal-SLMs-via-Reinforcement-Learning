                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 No prior chest radiographs for comparison.  Comparison is made to CT C-spine
 of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Allowing for low lung volumes, heart is upper limits of normal in
 size.  Aorta is mildly tortuous, and pulmonary vascularity is normal. 
 Prominence of right superior mediastinal contour appears to correspond to
 tortuous brachiocephalic vessels on recent CT.  Additionally, thyroid
 enlargement may contribute to this appearance in the upper paratracheal
 region.  Small right pleural effusion is apparently new from the prior study,
 and is accompanied by adjacent right basilar lung opacity.  Bones are
 demineralized, and slight decrease in height is seen in multiple vertebral
 bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis or
 consolidation.
