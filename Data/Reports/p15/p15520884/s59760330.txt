                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  Allowing for that, there is no definite change in
 cardiac, mediastinal or hilar contours.  A right basilar opacity has probably
 cleared.  However, mild new opacification is present at the left lung base
 partly obscuring the left hemidiaphragm.  Small pleural effusions are
 difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suspected left basilar opacity, with a pattern commonly associated with
 atelectasis.  If developing infection is a clinical concern then short-term
 follow-up radiographs may be helpful, preferably with PA and lateral technique
 if feasible.
