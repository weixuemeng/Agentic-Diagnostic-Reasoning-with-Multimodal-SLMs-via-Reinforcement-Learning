  artifact but possibly true nodule; recommend chest CT when clinically
  appropriate.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Surgical clips project over the right axilla.  A nipple shadow is visualized
 on the right side.  In addition to the nipple shadow, there is a small nodular
 density projecting along the lateral right mid chest, for which aritfact
 versus true pulmonary nodule (but not apparent before) is questioned.  Patchy
 vascular calcifications are noted along the upper abdominal aorta.  Bony
 structures appear unchanged including slight loss among lower thoracic
 vertebral body heights, which appears chronic.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Possible lung nodule on the right;
 particularly given the history of malignancy, chest CT is recommended when
 clinically appropriate to evaluate further.  A preliminary reading was
 provided by electronic means while the patient was still in the ER.
