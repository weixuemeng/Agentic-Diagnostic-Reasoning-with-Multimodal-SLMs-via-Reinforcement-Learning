                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increased work of breath after eating.  Evaluate for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___. Chest  radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A feeding tube is seen within the stomach.  Accounting for the
 positional differences due to patient's rotation, there has been no change in
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Stable calcification of the aortic knob is
 noted.  Since the prior radiograph, there has been a slight increase in size
 of the left pleural effusion.  There is no effusion on the right.  The left
 pulmonary mass is unchanged.  There is no new consolidation.  Stable right
 lower rib fractures are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1)  Slight increase in size of small left pleural effusion. 
 2)  No new opacities to suggest aspiration.
