                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with mssa bacteremia, L4/L5 osteo, course
 complicated by aspiration pneumonia.  Evaluate for aspiration infectious
 process given rising leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and ___ from an
 outside facility.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right infrahilar opacity with partial obscuring of the right heart border is
 perhaps similar to ___ but slightly worse compared to ___, suggesting
 ongoing aspiration and and/or pneumonia.  Retrocardiac opacity with
 silhouetting of the lateral border of the thoracic aorta as well as left
 hemidiaphragm is overall unchanged to slightly improved compared to the prior
 exam and may reflect atelectasis and/or consolidation.  The heart is
 top-normal in size, unchanged.  Lung volumes are slightly low and prominence
 of the pulmonary vessels may be secondary to crowding effect.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is elevated and may suggest some component of right lower lung
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  No pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased infrahilar opacity concerning for ongoing aspiration pneumonia.
