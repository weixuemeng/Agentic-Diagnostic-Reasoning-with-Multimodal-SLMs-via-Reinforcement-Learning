                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Left upper lobe mass, status post transbronchial biopsy. 
 Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT examination dated ___; chest radiograph
 performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again a left suprahilar mass is seen measuring 2.4 cm in long dimension,
 similar in appearance compared to the prior CT as well as radiograph.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  A surgical resection chain is seen along the left
 mid lung zones.  Mild apical scarring is seen, predominantly at the left. 
 Minimal linear opacity is seen at the lung bases, probably atelectasis.
 
 Notable degenerative changes seen at the left shoulder, which appears
 considerably worse than the right, and appears somewhat dysmorphic, probably
 from prior fracture.
 
 Notable vascular calcifications also seen at the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Left suprahilar mass, consistent with prior chest radiograph.  No
 pneumothorax.
