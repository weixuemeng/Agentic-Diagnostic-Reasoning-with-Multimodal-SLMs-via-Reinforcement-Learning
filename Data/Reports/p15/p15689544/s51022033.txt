 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms consistent with
 COPD/emphysema, as also seen on the prior study.  No evidence of focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable.  The aortic calcification is again
 seen.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary emphysema/COPD without acute interval change.
