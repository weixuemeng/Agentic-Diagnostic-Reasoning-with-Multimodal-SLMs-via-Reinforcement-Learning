                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, recent upper respiratory tract infection and
 sinusitis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac silhouette size is mildly
 enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable, and the pulmonary vascularity is normal.  There is minimal
 patchy opacity within the left lung base.  This could reflect atelectasis as
 the lung volumes are slightly low.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with left basilar patchy opacity which could
 represent atelectasis.  Infection is not completely excluded.
