                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is mild indistinctness of the
 pulmonary vascular markings, new since prior.  Blunting of the right posterior
 costophrenic angle raises possibility of small effusion, decreased since
 prior.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess given overlying
 the right chest wall pacing device which partially obscures the silhouette. 
 Prosthetic aortic valve is seen as well as median sternotomy wires.  Bones are
 diffusely osteopenic.  No definite acute osseous abnormality detected. 
 Degenerative changes noted at the shoulders bilaterally.  Severe lower
 thoracic upper lumbar levoscoliosis is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with improved bilateral effusions since
 ___ with trace effusion likely persisting on the right.
