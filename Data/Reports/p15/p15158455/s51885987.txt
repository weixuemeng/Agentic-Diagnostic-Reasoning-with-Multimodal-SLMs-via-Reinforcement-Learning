                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest pain status post lung biopsy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 14:24 and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Previously noted small right apical pneumothorax is not clearly visible on the
 current exam.  Patchy opacity within the right lower lobe corresponds to the
 known lesion which was recently biopsied.  Subsegmental atelectasis is seen in
 the left lung base.  No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is detected. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously noted small right apical pneumothorax is not clearly seen on the
 current exam and likely has resolved.  Patchy right basilar opacity
 corresponding to the known right lower lobe lesion is better assessed on the
 previous CT.
