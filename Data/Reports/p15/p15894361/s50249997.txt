  New NG tube terminates within stomach. Lung volumes are low. Blunting of the
  left costophrenic angle may represent a small pleural effusion, but this could
  be better assessed with PA and lateral radiographs on full inspiration. Lungs
  are otherwise clear.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis, assess NG tube position.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___, an enteric type tube has been placed.  The radiopaque
 tip overlies the gastric fundus, apparently making a slight curve to do so.  
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.  There is a small left
 pleural effusion, slightly increased compared with the earlier film. 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly low, without gross atelectasis.  No CHF or
 right-sided effusion.
