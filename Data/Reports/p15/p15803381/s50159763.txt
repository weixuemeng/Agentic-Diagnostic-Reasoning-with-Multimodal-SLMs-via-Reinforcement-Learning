                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, now
 status post Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent from
 ___.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A Dobbhoff catheter courses below the
 diaphragm, crosses midline, and terminates in the region of the gastroduodenal
 junction.  There is increased opacity within the left lung base, which likely
 reflects increasing pleural fluid.  There is increased pulmonary vascular
 congestion as compared to most recent prior examination, though no overt
 interstitial edema.  Mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar to prior. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobbhoff catheter at the gastroduodenal junction.
 2.  Probable mild increase in moderate left pleural effusion.
