                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever and confusion, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The patient
 is markedly rotated and kyphotic which likely in part accounts for the
 prominence of the superior mediastinum. In addition patient has a known right
 thyroid goiter. Allowing for this, the lungs appear clear with blunting of the
 bilateral costophrenic sulci potentially related to overlying soft tissue or
 pleural thickening particularly given the presence of numerous bilateral old
 rib fractures.  
 
 However, there is a retrocardiac opacity which is more pronounced than on the
 prior study.  This could reflect left lower lobe atelectasis; however a left
 lower lobe pneumonia is also possible.  Profound collapse of two mid thoracic
 spine vertebral bodies is seen with hyperdense material within 1 of them
 consistent with prior vertebroplasty.  The heart remains mildly enlarged with
 calcified and tortuous aortic contour.
 
 IMPRESSION: Limited examination. Retrocardiac opacity suggestive of
 atelectasis or infectious process. Given this limitation, a repeat evaluation
 is recommended with conventional PA and lateral chest radiographs obtained at
 optimal inspiration if possible.
 
 These findings were discussed in person with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at ___ on
