                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mild hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided AICD/pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal
 contour is unremarkable.  Severe enlargement of the pulmonary arteries
 bilaterally is compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated with mild emphysematous changes again seen.  Chronic
 interstitial abnormality is most pronounced within the periphery of the right
 upper and mid lung fields, slightly progressed compared to the prior
 radiograph.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  There is no pulmonary edema.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.  Mild emphysema with chronic
 interstitial abnormality most pronounced within the periphery of the right
 upper and mid lung fields.  Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
