 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, right upper lobe collapse.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 1:28 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the partial right upper
 lobe collapse has substantially improved.  However, there are some remnant
 minimal opacities in the right upper lobe, probably of atelectatic origin. 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and marked hilar enlargements.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Nasogastric tube
 and endotracheal tube are constant.
