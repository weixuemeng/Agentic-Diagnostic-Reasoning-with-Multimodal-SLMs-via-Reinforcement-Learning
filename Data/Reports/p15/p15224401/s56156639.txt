                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chronic cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.  Compared to the
 prior radiograph, there is interval increase in the lung volumes.  No focal
 consolidation is identified.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiac contour is partially obscured by a large posterior density which
 is a hiatal hernia, with an air-fluid level.  The trachea is partially
 rightwardly deviated, which is unchanged from the prior radiograph, and may
 represent an anatomic variant.  Right-sided healed rib fractures are noted. 
 Mild degenerative changes and kyphosis of the thoracic spine is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large hiatal hernia.
 2.  Old healed right rib fractures.
 3.  No acute consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
