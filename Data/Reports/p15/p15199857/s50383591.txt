                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Mild cardiomegaly is re-
 demonstrated.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable except for
 atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic knob.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  There is minimal atelectasis in the left lung base without
 focal consolidation.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle may
 suggest the presence of a trace pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  There are moderate degenerative changes seen in the thoracic spine.
 Clips are noted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion and minimal left basilar atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
