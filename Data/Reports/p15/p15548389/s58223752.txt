                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with L sided chest pain after ? trauma  // eval for
 consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax,
 or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 Healed fracture deformity, left seventh rib is chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Clear lungs.
 2.  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen,
 conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or
 characterization of such abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest
 cage abnormality is clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal
 findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or
 CT scanning.
