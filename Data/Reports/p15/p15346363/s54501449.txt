                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  OG tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to a prior study
 obtained at 04:08 a.m.
 
 The NG tube tip is not clearly seen on the current examination, most likely
 still in the proximal stomach.  There is no change in the cardiomediastinal
 appearance.  Bibasal areas of atelectasis are present, unchanged.  The rest of
 the tubes and lines are unchanged as well.
