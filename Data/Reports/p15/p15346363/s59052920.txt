                                 FINAL REPORT
 PATIENT HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post traumatic intracranial
 hemorrhage and suspected aspiration.
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube ends at 4 cm from carina.  The NG tube ends the in
 proximal gastric cavity, and can be advanced at least 5 cm.  As compared to
 yesterday, the lung volume is largely increased with improvement of upper and
 mid lung opacification, likely for reduced pulmonary edema. The reduction of
 heart size is a sign of improved cardica function.  Persist linear opacity at
 the lung bases, especially on the right, likely for atelectasis.  Small
 pleural effusion on the right base.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved lung ventilation for reduced pulmonary edema, persist
 lung base atelectasis, minimal to the left, small to the right with small
 right pleural effusion. NG tube should be pushed down 5 cm.
