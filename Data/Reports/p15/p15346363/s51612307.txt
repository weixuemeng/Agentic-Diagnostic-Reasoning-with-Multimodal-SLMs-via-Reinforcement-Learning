                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with subdural hematoma on
 ventilation with desaturations.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest while comparing to the prior study demonstrates
 bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions, slightly different in
 configuration but overall similar in severity.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Potentially infectious process can be present as part of the bibasal
 consolidations.
