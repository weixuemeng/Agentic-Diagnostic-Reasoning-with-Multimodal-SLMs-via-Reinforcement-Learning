                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with intracranial
 hemorrhage and fluid overload.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained on ___.
 
 The ET tube tip, the left central venous line are in unchanged positions. 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Bilateral pleural effusions and
 bibasilar opacities are grossly unchanged with minimal improvement on the
 right side.  Overall, the opacities, although might represent areas of
 atelectasis in the presence of pleural effusion, might also be obscuring
 infectious process.
