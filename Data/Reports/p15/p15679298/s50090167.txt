                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with acute kidney injury and weakness.  Evaluate
 for acute process.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Heart size is slightly
 enlarged since the prior exam and pulmonary vascular markings are increased,
 consistent with early cardiac decompensation.  Faint opacity in the right
 lower lobe could represent edema or pneumonia.  A vague nodular opacity in the
 right upper lung measures approxiamtely 1.1 cm.  Rounded density at the left
 lung base is similar to ___ and likely corresponds to a nipple
 shadow.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Sternotomy wires are intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Early cardiac decompensation.
 2.  Faint right lower lobe opacity could represent either asymmetric edema or
 pneumonia.
 3.  Vague nodule in right upper lung, for which CT or repeat chest radiograph
 after therapy is recommended.
 
 Findings were communicated via phone call by ___ to ___ on
