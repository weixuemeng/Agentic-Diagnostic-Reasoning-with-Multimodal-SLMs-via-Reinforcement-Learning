                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Persistent MRSA bacteremia, questionable retained line fragment
 in the right subclavian vein.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, patient is malrotated and
 the region of the right lung apex and right shoulder is difficult to assess. 
 Given these limitations, there currently is no safe evidence for the presence
 of a retained catheter fragment along the visible displayed course of the
 right subclavian vein.
 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral
 areas of atelectasis and mild fluid overload, unchanged course of the
 pacemaker leads.  No new parenchymal opacities.
