                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia seen in the lower lobe on recent CT.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis ___, chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged and within normal limits.  The pulmonary vascularity is within
 normal limits.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity is re- demonstrated as seen on the
 recent CT, and appears improved compared to the prior exams likely reflective
 of improving pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal
 right basilar streaky opacity is compatible with atelectasis.  No pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion is demonstrated.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improved left lower lobe patchy opacity likely reflective of improving
 pneumonia.
