                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, hypoxia, left chest wall pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The exam is underpenetration, presumed due to patient body habitus.
 Relative haziness of the lung bases on the frontal view is most likely in
 large part due to overlying soft tissue.  On the lateral view, there is a
 patchy opacity projecting over the heart, difficult to discern on the frontal
 view whether this in the right middle lobe or the lingula, but also present on
 ___ and grossly stable since ___ and may represent chronic
 atelectasis/scarring.  The left base retrocardiac region is difficult to
 assess.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette
 remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal study due to underpenetration, presumed due to patient
 body habitus.  Patchy opacity projecting over the cardiac silhouette on
 lateral view was likely also present on ___ and grossly stable since
 ___ and may represent chronic atelectasis/scarring.
