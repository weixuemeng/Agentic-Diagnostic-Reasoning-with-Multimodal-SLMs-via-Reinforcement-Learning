                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the prior radiograph, the lung volumes are
 significantly lower, with resultant crowding of the vascular structures and
 exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette which is likely within normal limits. 
 There is no evidence of consolidation, edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, but no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
