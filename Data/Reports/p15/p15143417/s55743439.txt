 WET READ: ___ ___ 3:41 PM
  Chronic changes particularly at the lung bases without definite acute
  cardiopulmonary process.
  Right lateral indentation on the trachea at the thoracic inlet that may be
  from right-sided thyroid enlargement and can be confirmed by thyroid
  ultrasound.
  Air-fluid level in the region of the esophagus seen on the lateral view.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___M with fall  // Eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Linear opacities with hyperlucency identified at the lung bases, more
 conspicuous on the right than the left are likely due to scarring. The lungs
 are clear of consolidation. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  1 of the 2 lateral views demonstrates an air-fluid level below the
 aortic arch potentially due to potentially within the esophagus. There is a
 right lateral indentation on the trachea at the thoracic inlet potentially due
 to a right-sided thyroid enlargement. No acute osseous abnormalities
 identified.
