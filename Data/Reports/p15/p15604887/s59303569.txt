 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Elevated white blood cell count, assessment for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 vertebral stabilization device that projects over the cervical spine.  The
 lung volumes have decreased.  At both lung bases, plate-like atelectasis is
 visible.  However, no parenchymal opacities have newly occurred that would
 suggest pneumonia.  No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.  Unchanged
 appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
