                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible right lower lobe consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there again are lower lung
 volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of normal or slightly
 enlarged.  Minimal poor definition of pulmonary vessels could reflect slight
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Blunting of costophrenic angles could
 reflect small effusions or pleural thickening.  
 
 No definite pneumonia is appreciated, though in the appropriate clinical
 setting a supervening consolidation would be difficult to exclude in lower
 zones.
