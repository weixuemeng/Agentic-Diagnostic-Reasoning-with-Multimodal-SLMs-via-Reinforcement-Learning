                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and intubation for airway protection.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the lung volumes
 have improved.  Endotracheal tube has been removed, as has the nasogastric
 tube.  Left hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, consistent with some decrease
 in volume loss in the left lower lobe.  However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 A ___ pain projects over the left tracheal margin.
