                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with SOB  // PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Midline sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal clips are noted.  There is a subtle patchy opacity within the
 right upper lobe which is concerning for an early pneumonia.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is a small
 out pouching of the posterior right hemidiaphragm which is likely a small
 eventration or Bochdalek's hernia.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 grossly unremarkable though there is calcification along the aortic knob. 
 Bony structures appear relatively intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings concerning for early right upper lobe pneumonia.
