 right-sided Swan-Ganz is around the pulmonary valve or right ventricular
 outflow tract.  There is bilateral chest tube without visible pneumothorax. 
 Pulmonary edema has completely resolved since ___.  Right lower thorax
 opacity is probably due to subpulmonary pleural effusion that is unchanged.
