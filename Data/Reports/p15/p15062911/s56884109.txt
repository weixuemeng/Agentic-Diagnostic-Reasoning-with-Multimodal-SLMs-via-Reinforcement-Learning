 moderate right pleural effusions are grossly unchanged allowing the difference
 in positioning of the patient.  Bibasilar opacities, consistent with
 atelectasis, have increased on the right.  ET tube is seen in standard
 position.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  NG tube tip is out of
 view below the diaphragm.
