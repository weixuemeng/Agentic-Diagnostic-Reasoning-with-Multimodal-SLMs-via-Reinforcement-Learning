                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP upright AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with history of pleural effusion, now with hypoxia to ___ RA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Lung volumes are markedly low.  A large left pleural effusion appears
 marginally increased from prior.  Increased diffuse pulmonary opacities raise
 concern for multifocal pneumonia though difficult to exclude underlying
 pulmonary edema.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  Aortic calcification again
 noted.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
