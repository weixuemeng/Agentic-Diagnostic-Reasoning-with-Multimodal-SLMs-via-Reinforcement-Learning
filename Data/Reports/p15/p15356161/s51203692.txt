 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the left-sided effusion
 has slightly decreased in extent.  This decrease is more obvious on the
 frontal than on the lateral radiograph.  However, the left effusion still
 occupies approximately a quarter of the left hemithorax.  Subsequent
 atelectasis are seen at the left lung bases.  No pneumothorax.  No change in
 appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the right lung.
