                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large left-sided pleural effusion, increased in size
 compared to prior examination with associated compressive atelectasis. 
 Determination of the heart size is not possible due to obscuration by this
 large pleural effusion.  There is no large right-sided pleural effusion. 
 There is mild central vascular pulmonary congestion with slight increased
 interstitial markings compatible with mild pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large left pleural effusion, increased in size compared to prior
 examination with mild pulmonary edema.  Although there is no definite
 consolidation worrisome for pneumonia, concurrent infectious process cannot be
 excluded given the appropriate clinical circumstance.  The effusion should be
 followed to resolution with consideration of diagnostic thoracentesis.
