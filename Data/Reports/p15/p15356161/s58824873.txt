                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___-year-old man with tremors, concern for infectious cause, evaluate for

 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 TECHNIQUE
 Frontal and lateral view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A hemodialysis catheter ends in the right atrium, and is unchanged in
 position.  Again seen is opacification involving the left lung base, which
 represents a small to moderate pleural effusion and associated compressive
 atelectasis, unchanged since ___. Since prior, there has been increased
 opacification at the right lung base, likely representing atelectasis. There
 is no pneumothorax. A right-sided scoliosis is again noted.  Calcifications
 are noted within a tortuous aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged moderate left pleural effusion with associated compressive
 atelectasis.
 2. Increased opacification at the right lung base, which likely represents
 atelectasis.
