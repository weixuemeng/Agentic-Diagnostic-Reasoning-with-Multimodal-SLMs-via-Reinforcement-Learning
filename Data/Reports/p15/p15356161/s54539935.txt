                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion evaluation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been
 re-accumulation of pleural fluid on the left, slightly less than that on the
 earlier study of this admission dated ___.  The configuration raises the
 possibility of some amount of loculation.  Some increasing fullness of
 pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Retrocardiac opacification suggests some substantial volume loss in the left
 lower lobe.
