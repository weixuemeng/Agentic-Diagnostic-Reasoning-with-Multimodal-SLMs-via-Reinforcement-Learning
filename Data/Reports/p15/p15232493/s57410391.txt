 otherwise unremarkable.  There is a degree of haziness within the costophrenic
 angles as well as redistribution of pulmonary vasculature to suggest pulmonary
 vascular congestion; however, the degree of congestion does not appear to be
 significantly different from the prior study ___ ___.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear with no focal infiltrates, pleural effusions or evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
