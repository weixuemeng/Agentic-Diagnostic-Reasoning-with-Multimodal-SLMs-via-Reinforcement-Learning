                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, COPD, CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are relatively hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is likely mild pulmonary edema. 
 No discrete focal consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion,
 although trace pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Projecting over
 the left upper hemithorax at the left upper lateral lung/scapula, there is an
 ill-defined 1.2-cm rounded opacity, difficult to discern whether pulmonary or
 potentially within the scapula.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Ill-defined 1.2-cm opacity projecting over the left upper hemithorax,
 difficult to discern whether pulmonary or within the scapula.  Recommend
 either shallow oblique views or chest CT for further evaluation to assess for
 a possible underlying pulmonary lesion.
