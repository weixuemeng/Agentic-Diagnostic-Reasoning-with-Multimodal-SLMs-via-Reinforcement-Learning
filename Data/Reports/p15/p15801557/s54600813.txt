                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  There is again hyperexpansion of the lungs with some enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette and tortuosity of the aorta.  No evidence of acute
 focal pneumonia.
 
 The nodular opacification seen previously in the left upper zone is not
 appreciated on this study, possibly due to a different obliquity of the
 patient.
