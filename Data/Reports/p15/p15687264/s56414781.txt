                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman POD___ s/p MIE  // Evaluate for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Atelectasis at the right lung base appears minimally improved.  Opacities at
 the left lung base have increased.  There is a new, small right apical and
 right basilar pneumothorax. Pneumoperitoneum appears unchanged, though
 subcutaneous emphysema has increased compared to prior.  An enteric tube
 terminates in the distal esophagus, unchanged in position.  A right-sided
 drainage catheter is unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New, small right pneumothorax and substantially increased subcutaneous
 emphysema suggest the possibility of a chest tube leak, though chest tube not
 obviously changed in position.  Increased opacity at the left lung base may
 reflect increased atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 11:48 AM, approximately
 15 minutes after discovery of the findings.
