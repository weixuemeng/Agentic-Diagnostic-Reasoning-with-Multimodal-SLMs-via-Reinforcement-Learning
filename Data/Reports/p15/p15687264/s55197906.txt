                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with POD___ s/p MIE  // Evaluate for interval
 change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post minimally invasive esophagectomy.  Interval
 improvement in bilateral, predominantly perihilar interstitial opacities,
 likely improving pulmonary edema.  There is persistence of a small right
 apical pneumothorax, stable since prior exam.  Bilateral small pleural
 effusions and bibasilar atelectasis are similar to prior study.  The heart
 size is unchanged.  A right pleural catheter is in standard placement.  An
 air-fluid level projects over the right mainstem bronchus, likely representing
 the neo-esophagus.  Substantial subcutaneous emphysema is mildly increased in
 prominence compared to prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement in previously noted mild pulmonary edema since ___.
 2. Persistent small right apical pneumothorax.
 3. Unchanged bilateral small pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis since
 ___.
 4. An air-fluid level projects over the right mainstem bronchus, likely
 representing the neo esophagus.
