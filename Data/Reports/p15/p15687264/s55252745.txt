                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman POD___ s/p MIE  // Evaluate for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___ chest radiographs
 ___ preoperative PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared 1 day prior, bilateral, predominantly perihilar interstitial
 opacities have increased, more likely pulmonary edema than bilateral
 pneumonia.  Persistent small right apical pneumothorax.  A small right pleural
 effusion has increased and a small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  Right
 pleural drainage catheter is unchanged in position.  Subcutaneous emphysema in
 the right lateral chest wall is similar.  Mildly enlarged cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged in size.  An air-fluid level projects over the
 expected location of the neo esophagus
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increasing pulmonary edema, alternatively worsening bilateral pneumonia.
 2. Persistent small right apical pneumothorax.
 3. Small right pleural effusion is increased and small left pleural effusion
 is unchanged.
 4. An air-fluid level is likely located within the neo esophagus.  If there is
 legitimate clinical concern for a mediastinal collection, CT would be
 necessary for assessment.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  An air-fluid level is likely located within the neo
 esophagus.  If there is legitimate clinical concern for a mediastinal
 collection, CT would be necessary for assessment.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___ by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 11:23 AM, 5 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
