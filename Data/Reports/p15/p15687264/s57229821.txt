                                 FINAL REPORT

 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with GE junction SCC now POD___ s/p MIE  //
 Evaluate for interval change      Evaluate for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___, 09:05.
 
 Bilateral perihilar interstitial abnormality has developed and heart size has
 increased, suggesting pulmonary edema due to cardiac decompensation. 
 Mediastinal veins are minimally larger but obscured by the neo esophagus. 
 Fluid level just above the tip of the transesophageal drainage catheter is
 presumably retained air and fluid in the neo esophagus, but I cannot identify
 on the lateral view and therefore cannot be certain that the air and fluid
 collection is in the neo esophagus rather than mediastinum or pleura which are
 much less likely.
 
 Previous right lower lobe atelectasis has improved.  Moderate left pleural
 effusion and some left basal atelectasis are stable.  Tiny right apical
 pneumothorax is smaller.
 
 Right pleural drainage catheter unchanged in position.  Subcutaneous emphysema
 is greater in the right chest wall than before, suggesting continued air leak,
 even if it is not accumulating in the pleural space.
 
 Pneumoperitoneum is improving.  .
