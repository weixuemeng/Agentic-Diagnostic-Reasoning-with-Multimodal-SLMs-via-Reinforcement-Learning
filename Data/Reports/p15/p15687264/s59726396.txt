 Evaluate for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is little overall change in the
 postoperative appearance with persistent small right apical pneumothorax and
 substantial subcutaneous gas along the right lateral chest wall.  There is the
 vague suggestion of an area of increased opacification in the left mid zone. 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, this could reflect a developing
 pneumonia.
