                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior CT torso from ___ as well as a chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Elevated WBC with altered mental status, question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Linear
 densities at the left lung base are most compatible with plate-like
 atelectasis.  Patient is known to have left-sided rib fractures which likely
 account for some degree of splinting on the left.  These fractures are better
 assessed on the prior CT.  The right lung is clear.  No convincing signs of
 pneumonia.  The heart and mediastinal contours appear normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Plate-like left lower lung atelectasis without definite signs of
 pneumonia.  Known left rib fractures are better assessed on prior outside
 hospital CT scan.
