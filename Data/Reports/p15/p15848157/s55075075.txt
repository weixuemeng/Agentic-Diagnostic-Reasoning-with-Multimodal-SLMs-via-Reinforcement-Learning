 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 new left-sided PICC line.  The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of
 the line projects over the cavoatrial junction.  No evidence of complications,
 notably no pneumothorax.  Preexisting atelectatic opacities at the left lung
 bases have completely resolved.
