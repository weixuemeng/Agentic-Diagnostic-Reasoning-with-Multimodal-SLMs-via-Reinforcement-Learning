                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Additional history that there is a breast implant on the left likely
 explains asymmetric density, in addition to mild asymmetry in positioning. 
 Accordingly it is likely that no pneumonia is present.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and malaise.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Opacity in the
 lingula suggests pneumonia.  Elsewhere the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest pneumonia in the lingula.
