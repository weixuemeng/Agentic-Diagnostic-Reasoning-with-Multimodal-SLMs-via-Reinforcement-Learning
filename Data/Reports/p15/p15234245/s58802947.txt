                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ common 201 0.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged with leads again
 terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The lung volumes
 are low.  Allowing for that, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 probably unchanged.  On the right, the lungs appear clear without pleural
 effusion.  On the left there is patchy opacification in the lingula and left
 lower lobe but no pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. Mild
 degenerative changes affect the mid through lower lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacities at the left lung base which may be seen with pneumonia in the
 appropriate setting. Correlation with clinical presentation is suggested. 
 Areas of atelectasis could have a similar appearance.
