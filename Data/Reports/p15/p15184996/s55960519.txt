                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with coronary artery disease, CHF and leg
 swelling.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Frontal view suggests new opacification in the right lower lobe, but there are
 no findings to support that on the lateral.  I suspect this is instead due to
 the shape of his chest.  Lungs are actually clear.  Heart is normal size. 
 There are no findings to suggest cardiac decompensation.  No indication of
 adenopathy or pleural abnormality.  Sternal wires are intact.
