 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 12:28 AM
  Nasogastric tube extremely difficult to visualize secondary to overlying soft
  tissue.  The tube can be traced to at least the GE junction, and likely
  extends past the GE junction but is not well visualized beyond the diaphragm.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with MCA stroke s/p cardioversion with
 dysphagia  // NG tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect frontal chest radiographs again demonstrate a left
 approach central catheter terminating in the mid to low SVC.  An enteric tube
 courses below the diaphragm to at least the level of the GE junction.  It
 cannot be definitely traced further.  The side port is likely above the GE
 junction.  Lung volumes are low.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is mild
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 An enteric tube courses to at least the level of the GE junction, with the
 side port possibly within the distal esophagus.  This too should be advanced
 several cm to terminate within the stomach.  Mild pulmonary edema.
