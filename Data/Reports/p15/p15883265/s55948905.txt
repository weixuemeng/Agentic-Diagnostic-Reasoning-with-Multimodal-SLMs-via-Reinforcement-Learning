                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Unresponsive episode, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed at outside
 hospital ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
 mediastinal, hilar and cardiac contours.  Patient is intubated with
 endotracheal tube terminating 2.8 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is
 coiled within the fundus.  Bilateral low lung volumes identified with
 increased opacification within the right lung base compared to next preceding
 study, may represent atelectasis, though given unresponsive state, aspiration
 is a consideration.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube 2.8 cm above the carina.  Well-positioned
 nasogastric tube.  Increased opacification of right lung base, atelectasis
 versus aspiration pneumonitis.
