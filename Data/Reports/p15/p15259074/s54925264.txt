 New leftward mediastinal shift suggests that much of the increase in
 opacification of the left lung is due to severe worsening left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Large heart is partially obscured, probably unchanged. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are likely moderate on the left small on the
 right.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Nasogastric drainage tube ends above the diaphragm and would need to be
 advanced 15 cm to move all side ports into the stomach.  ET tube, left PIC
 line, left jugular line are in standard placements respectively.
