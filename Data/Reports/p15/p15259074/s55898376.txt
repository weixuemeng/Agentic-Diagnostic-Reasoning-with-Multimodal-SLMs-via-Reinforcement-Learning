                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p GIB. Now with increased cough and RR. Concern
 for aspiration.  // Given change in clinical exam. Please evaluate for
 aspiration pneumonia vs. pleural effusion?    Given change in clinical exam.
 Please evaluate for aspiration pneumonia vs. pleural effusion?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are extremely low
 lung volumes.  Opacification at the left base with obscuration of the
 hemidiaphragm is consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left
 lower lobe.  Less prominent changes are seen at the right base.  Mild
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.
 Given the low lung volumes and basilar changes, in the appropriate setting it
 would be extremely difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in
 the absence of a lateral view.
