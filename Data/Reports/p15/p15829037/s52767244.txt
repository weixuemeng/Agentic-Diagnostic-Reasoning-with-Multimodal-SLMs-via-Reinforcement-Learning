                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with stent placement, question atelectasis,
 new oxygen requirement.
 
 No comparison studies.
 
 Please note that comparison to old films can be helpful to detect subtle
 interval change.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Heart is normal in size.  Mediastinal contours are likely within normal
 limits.  There is some prominence of both hila which more likely reflect
 prominent pulmonary vasculature rather than lymphadenopathy. No evidence of
 pneumothorax. 
 
 2. There is a diffuse interstitial abnormality as well as a more patchy
 opacity in the retrocardiac region, a component of which is linear and may
 represent subsegmental atelectasis.  There is likely a small left effusion. 
 In the absence of comparison studies, this could reflect a chronic
 interstitial abnormality with a superimposed left lower lobe atelectasis,
 pneumonia or aspiration.  Alternatively, mild interstitial edema should also
 be considered. Clinical correlation is advised.
