                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right internal jugular central venous catheter placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same day 8:42 p.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to earlier same day examination, the right internal
 jugular access central venous catheter has been partially withdrawn with the
 tip now projecting over the low SVC.  Otherwise no significant change from two
 hours prior with redemonstration of bibasilar opacities most likely
 representing aspiration given appearance on previous CT.
