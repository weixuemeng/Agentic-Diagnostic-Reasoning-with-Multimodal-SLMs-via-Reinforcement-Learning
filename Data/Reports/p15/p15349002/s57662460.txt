                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sharp right-sided chest pain  // Eval for
 pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest PA and lateral ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Small pneumothorax of the right lung apex cannot be excluded. Linear scarring
 of the right midlung and stable thickening of the right lateral pleura is
 seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures
 are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Port-A-Cath
 remains in place terminating at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Small pneumothorax of the right lung apex cannot be excluded although
 doubtful.
 
 2. Linear scar in the right midlung is seen.
 
 3. Stable thickening of the right lateral pleura is seen, likely secondary to
 thoracotomy.
