                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tracheal resection  // post-op     
 post-op
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the current study is extremely
 limited due to low lung volumes and the chin and other devices about the
 patient greatly obscuring detail.  There is asymmetric opacification at the
 left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm.  This could reflect
 merely atelectasis and effusion postoperatively.  However, the possibility of
 superimposed aspiration would have to be seriously considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
