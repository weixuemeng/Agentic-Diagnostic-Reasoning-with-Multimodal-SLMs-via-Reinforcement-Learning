                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Severe mucous plugging with desaturations.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tracheostomy tube terminates 3.2 cm above the carina.  A right Port-A-Cath
 terminating at the upper SVC is unchanged in position.  An epidural catheter
 is again demonstrated.  There is no new consolidation or pneumothorax. There
 is a trace left pleural effusion, not seen on the ___ 13:04
 examination, though this may relate to better inspiratory effort on the
 current study. New linear left basilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours remain within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No new consolidation. Mild left basilar atelectasis.
 2.  Small left pleural effusion.
