                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac surgery.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring
 and support devices are essentially unchanged.  Again there is enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with prominence of the upper mediastinum as well as
 opacification in the left apical region consistent with pleural fluid. 
 Retrocardiac opacification persists, and the right lung is essentially clear. 
 
 
 This information was telephoned to Dr. ___.
