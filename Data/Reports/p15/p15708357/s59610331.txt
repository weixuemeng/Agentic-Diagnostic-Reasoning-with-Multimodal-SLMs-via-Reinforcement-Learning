                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fall change in mental status anticoagulated
 for artificial aortic valve. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___. Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  A previously seen right lower lobe opacity has
 resolved in the interval. Obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm margin may be
 secondary to a combination of small pleural effusion with associated right
 basilar fibrosis/atelectasis. No focal opacities concerning for pneumonia are
 seen. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Sternotomy
 wires are intact. Prosthetic aortic valve is better seen in the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Minimal right-sided pleural
 effusion with associated atelectasis and stable moderate cardiomegaly is
 identified.
