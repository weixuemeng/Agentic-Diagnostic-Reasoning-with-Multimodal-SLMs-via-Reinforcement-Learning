                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with hypoxia and chest pain, evaluate for edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is notable for moderate cardiomegaly, similar to
 the prior examination.  Increased bilateral opacities in a perihilar
 distribution and thickening of the minor fissure is consistent with mild
 pulmonary edema.  Small pleural effusions are not excluded.  There is no focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly, mild interstitial pulmonary edema, and
 probable small bilateral effusions.
