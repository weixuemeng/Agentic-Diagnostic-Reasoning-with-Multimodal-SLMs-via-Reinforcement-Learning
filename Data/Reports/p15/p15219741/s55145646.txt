                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion now s/p thoracentesis,
 small pneumothorax on prior CXR  // pneumothorax?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph with the same date at 12:00.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a small right apical pneumothorax, which is unchanged in size.
 There is increased opacification at the right midlung and right base, which
 may represent increasing pleural effusion layering and tracking within the
 minor fissure.  There is right basilar compressive atelectasis. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged size of the small right apical pneumothorax.
 2. Increased opacification within the right lung, which likely represents a
 moderate sized layering right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis.
