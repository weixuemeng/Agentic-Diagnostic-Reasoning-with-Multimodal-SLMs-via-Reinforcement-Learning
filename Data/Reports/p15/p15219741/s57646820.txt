  1.  Near complete resolution of right pleural effusion with mild right lower
  lobe atelectasis.
  2.  Prominence of the right costophrenic sulcus without associated

  atelectasis however a small basilar pneumothorax would be similar in
  appearance.  Recommend repeat chest radiograph to assess for interval change.
