                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, history of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 mild bilateral lower lobe atelectasis without definite focal consolidation. 
 No pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  Chronic-appearing
 changes are seen at the right lung apex, possibly emphysematous.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia, although
 comparison with priors would be helpful.
