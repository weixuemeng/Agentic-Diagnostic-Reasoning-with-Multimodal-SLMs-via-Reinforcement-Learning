                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath, chest pressure.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  There is no confluent consolidation.  There is,
 however, indistinct pulmonary vascular marking seen throughout.  There is
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggestive of small pleural effusion. 
 Right costophrenic angle is sharp.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  Bilateral deep brain stimulator devices project over the chest. 
 Median sternotomy wires are also noted.  Osseous and soft tissue structures
 are otherwise notable for hypertrophic changes in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion.
