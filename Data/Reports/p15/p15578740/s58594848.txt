                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with question of CHF versus pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  Midline sternotomy
 wires and abandoned epicardial pacing leads are seen.  Deep brain stimulator
 devices project over the lateral upper chest.  There are diffuse bilateral
 ground-glass opacities which are concerning for pulmonary edema.  An atypical
 pneumonia is also a possibility though thought unlikely.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal contour are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse pulmonary ground-glass opacities raises concern for
 pulmonary edema.  Findings could alternatively reflect atypical pneumonia. 
 Please correlate clinically.
