                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained.  Comparison was
 made to prior study at 1:00 a.m.  An endotracheal tube has been inserted 5 cm
 above the carina.  An orogastric tube extends inferiorly out of the field of
 view.  Opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle and left retrocardiac space is
 unchanged.  There is also bibasilar linear reticular opacities suggesting
 chronic lung disease.  Lung volumes are low.  The aortic arch remains enlarged
 and calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing bibasilar atelectasis and/or consolidation since the
 prior study at 1:00 a.m.  Appropriate position of endotracheal tube.
