                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with likely aspiration event, to look for
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was read in comparison with prior
 three radiographs acquired at different intervals on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Since yesterday radiograph acquired approximately 20 hours apart, atelectasis
 bilateral lower lungs and the right middle lobe has increased as reflected by
 increased opacities.  Ill-defined opacity in the right mid lung which is
 likely from aspiration is more conspicuous. The tip of the endotracheal tube
 ends 3.2 cm from the carina.  Orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into
 the stomach; however, distal end is beyond radiograph view.  Heart remains
 enlarged and calcified.
