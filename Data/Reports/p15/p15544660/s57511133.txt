                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with decreased oxygen saturation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two portable AP chest radiographs were obtained.  There are diffuse
 reticular interstitial opacities at the peripheral bases of both lungs as well
 as more sheet-like atelectasis of the right lower lobe.  The costophrenic
 angles are excluded from the film, but there is no large pleural effusion. 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart is enlarged.  The aortic arch is enlarged and
 calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Enlarged aortic arch and extensively calcified aortic arch, worrisome for
 aneurysmal dilatation. If warranted by clinical situation, further evaluation
 could be performed with Chest CTA.  
 
 2.  Reticular pulmonary opacities, most compatible with chronic lung disease.
 
 3.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
