                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:54 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with GI bleed.  Intubated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 With the chin in neutral position, tip of the endotracheal tube approximately
 2 cm above the carina is 15 mm below optimal position.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 is chronic.  Consolidation in the left lower lobe is a new finding, and could
 be due either to atelectasis or pneumonia.  Right lung is grossly clear. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.  Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is
 presumed.  I see none on the right.  The upper abdomen shows significantly
 distended colon, but no free subdiaphragmatic gas.
