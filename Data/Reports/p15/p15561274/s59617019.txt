                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes accentuate cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 structures.  Allowing for this factor, there is stable cardiomegaly.  Multiple
 calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are again demonstrated as well as
 calcified granulomas within the lungs.  Minimal linear scar or atelectasis is
 present at the right lung base.  No confluent areas of consolidation are
 identified, and there are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive heart failure.
 
 2.  Evidence of previous granulomatous exposure.
 
 3.  Prominent loops of bowel within imaged portion of upper abdomen,
 incompletely evaluated on this chest radiograph examination.  Consider
 dedicated abdominal series if warranted clinically.
