                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Motor vehicle collision and possible seizure. 
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky basilar opacity, seen
 posteriorly on the lateral view, suggests minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the
 lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy lingular and left lower lobe opacities, which could be
 seen with atelectasis, although a mild component of aspiration is difficult to
 exclude.
