                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Poor mental status, evaluate for developing pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval decrease in the prominence of the previously described
 bilateral lower lobe streaky opacities.  Redemonstrated are low lung volumes
 with change results in crowding of the bronchovascular structures at the
 bilateral lung bases.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax,
 or pulmonary edema seen.  There is stable, moderate cardiomegaly, although
 this may be secondary to the low lung volumes.  Mediastinal contours are
 normal.  The trachea is noted to be deviated towards the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2. Rightward trachea deviation.
