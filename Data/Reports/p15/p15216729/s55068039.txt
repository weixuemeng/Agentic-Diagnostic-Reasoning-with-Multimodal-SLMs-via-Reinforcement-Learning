  ET tube 6 cm above the carina.  NG tube within the esophagus, could advanced
  10 cm to be within the stomach.  Right IJ within the superior vena cava.  New
  bilateral, diffuse ground-glass opacities consistent with ARDS.  More
  confluent opacification in the right lower lung may reflect superimposed
  aspiration/pneumonia.  No definite pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Heart
  size normal.  Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 19:30 by phone.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ARDS after hernia repair and aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The ETT is 6 cm above the carina.  The NG tube is within the mid esophagus and
 should be advanced.  There is a right IJ line with tip in the superior vena
 cava.  There are new bilateral diffuse fluffy infiltrates that could represent
 diffuse infection, ARDS, or aspiration.  There is no effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There are  new  bilateral  diffuse  fluffy  infiltrates  that could represent
 diffuse infection or given history ARDS (although no intervening studies show
 this development).   There is  no effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.   The
 heart size is normal making the lung  findings on likely  represent  flash 
 pulmonary  edema.  The findings were  discussed  with Dr.  ___ at ___ by
 phone  by Dr.  ___.
