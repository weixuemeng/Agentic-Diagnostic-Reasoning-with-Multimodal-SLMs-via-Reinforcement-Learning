 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.1 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip is within the stomach.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The
 aortic knob is calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic sulcus to suggest presence of a trace right pleural effusion. 
 Patchy atelectasis is seen in the retrocardiac region.  No focal consolidation
 or large pneumothorax is demonstrated.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 visualized.
