                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient vomited, now with new oxygen
 requirement, question of aspiration pneumonitis.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 portable chest examinations obtained 8 and 12 hours earlier correspondingly
 during the same day.  The previously identified temporary pacer wire has been
 removed.  The heart size remains unchanged.  The initial congestive pulmonary
 vascular pattern appears now normalized.  A hazy density over the right lung
 base may be caused by pleural effusion layering in the posterior compartments,
 but this finding is not conclusive on this single AP chest view examination. 
 No pneumothorax can be identified in the apical area.  No new infiltrates are
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of recent aspiration as can be ruled out by single
 portable AP chest view.
