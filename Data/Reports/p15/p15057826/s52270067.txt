                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after stroke with concern
 for aspiration.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.  There are new bibasilar opacities that might potentially represent
 areas of aspiration.  There is also slight interval progression of
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  Left mid lung nodular opacity is noted, most
 likely representing vessels but attention to this area on the subsequent
 studies is recommended to exclude the possibility of pulmonary nodules.
