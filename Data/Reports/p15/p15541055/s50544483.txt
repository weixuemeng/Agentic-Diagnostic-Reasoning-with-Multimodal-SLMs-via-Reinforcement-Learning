                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with MVC  // r/o trauma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are well-expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation. 
 No acute displaced rib fractures identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
