 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are relatively low lung
 volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  Bibasilar
 opacifications, especially on the left, are consistent with small pleural
 effusions and underlying compressive atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, superimposed pneumonia at the left base would be difficult to
 exclude.
