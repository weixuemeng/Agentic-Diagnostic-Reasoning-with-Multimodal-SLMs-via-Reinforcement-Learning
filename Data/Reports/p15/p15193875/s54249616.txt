 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with GBM and Port-A-Cath blocked.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Port-A-Cath placement ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The catheter from a right chest Port-A-Cath courses in the
 subcutaneous soft tissues over the clavicle, then makes a 270-degree
 counterclockwise loop before extending inferiorly from the right IJ to the mid
 SVC.  It is difficult to tell whether this loop is in the subcutaneous tissues
 or the right internal jugular vein.  Immediately after placement in ___, the catheter followed the normally expected smooth arc from the
 subcutaneous tissues into the internal jugular vein.  No intervening imaging
 is available
 
 The lungs are clear.  There is no consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right chest Port-A-Cath catheter makes an abnormal loop in the
