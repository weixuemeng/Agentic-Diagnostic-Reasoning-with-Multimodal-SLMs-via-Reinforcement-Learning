                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis, pulm HTN  // eval tube
 placement      eval tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COMPARED TO CHEST RADIOGRAPHS SINCE ___, MOST RECENTLY ___ THROUGH
 ___ AT 04:05.
 
 Bibasilar pulmonary consolidation accompanied by moderate pulmonary edema
 improved on ___, but has worsened substantially in the right middle and
 lower lobes particularly since earlier in the day.  This is conceivably
 pneumonia, but the rapid change could also be due to pulmonary hemorrhage.  I
 do not believe it is dependent edema since there is no concurrent increase in
 the mild edema in the upper lobes.  Heart is normal size, although the right
 heart border is now obscured by right middle lobe consolidation.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 Indwelling right jugular sheath ends above the origin of the right
 brachiocephalic vein.  Right PIC line ends in the low SVC.  ET tube in
 standard placement.  Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out
 of view.

 Hospital, On Page), ___, M.D. by ___, M.D. on the telephone on
