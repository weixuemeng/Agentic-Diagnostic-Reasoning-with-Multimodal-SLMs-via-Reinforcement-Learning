                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP chest
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis, s/p NGT placement  // eval NGT
 placement      eval NGT placement
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 03:32.
 
 New esophageal drainage tube ends in the upper portion of a mildly distended
 stomach.
 
 Combination of that atelectasis dependent edema and pleural effusion at the
 right base has improved.  Left lung is unchanged, where invoked combination of
 linear opacities and small nodular shadows suggest edema and possible septic
 emboli.  I would suggest repeat chest radiographs, conventional if possible,
 after diuresis to see if the nodules are real.
 
 Heart size top-normal.
 
 Right internal jugular sheath ends at the origin of the right brachiocephalic
 vein, and the right PIC line ends in the mid to low SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
