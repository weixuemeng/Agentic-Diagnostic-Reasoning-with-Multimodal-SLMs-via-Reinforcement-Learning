                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Chronic blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 may be due to trace pleural effusion.  There are also likely atelectatic
 changes at the left lung base.  No definite focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Dual lead right-sided
 pacemaker is seen, placed in the interval since the prior study, with leads
 extending the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a
 trace pleural effusion.  Likely left basilar atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
