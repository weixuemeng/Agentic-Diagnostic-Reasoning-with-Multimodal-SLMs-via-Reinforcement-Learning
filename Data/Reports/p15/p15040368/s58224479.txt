                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Thoracic pain left side.  To evaluate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 REPORT:
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  The central pulmonary
 arteries are prominent but probably just within normal limits.  Minimal
 thickening of the right paratracheal stripe is identified but no additional
 convincing evidence of lymphadenopathy.  Visualized osseous structures are
 normal.
 
 The lung parenchyma appears grossly normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary finding is evident.
