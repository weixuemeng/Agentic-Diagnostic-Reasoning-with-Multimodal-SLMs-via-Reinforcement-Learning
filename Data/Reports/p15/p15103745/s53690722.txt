                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with resp failure, ETT in situ. OGT disloged,
 replaced w NGT.  // eval NGT placement      eval NGT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 05:55
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified. Endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line are
 unchanged in position given differences in patient positioning.  Given the
 marked patient rotation, assessment of cardiac and mediastinal contours is
 difficult. There continues to be bilateral layering effusions with associated
 patchy bibasilar airspace disease likely reflecting atelectasis, although
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Interval appearance of a patchy opacity in the
 right mid lung of uncertain significance. This can be further evaluated on
 followup imaging. Stable 3 mm nodular opacity in the left upper lobe unchanged
 since ___ and therefore consistent with a benign finding.  No pneumothorax.
