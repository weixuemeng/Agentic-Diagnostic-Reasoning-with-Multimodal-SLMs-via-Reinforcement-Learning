                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube position..
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 TECHNIQUE   Six portable views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Subsequent views of the chest demonstrates endotracheal tube repositioning.
 Final views demonstrate an endotracheal tube ending approximately 1.8 cm above
 the carina. Orogastric tube tip seems to end in the upper abdomen.  Again
 noted, is a left lower lung base opacity. New opacification of the right lower
 lobe, is likely secondary to a layering pleural effusion. The costophrenic
 angles are blunted bilaterally.  Cardiomediastinal hilar contours are
 unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube ends approximately 1.8 cm above the carina. Orogastric
 tube extends to the upper abdomen.
 2. Unchanged left lower lobe opacity.
 3. Bilateral layering pleural effusions.
