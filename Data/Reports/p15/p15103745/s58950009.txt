 Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right internal jugular central line
 are unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely
 stable given differences in patient rotation between studies. There continues
 to be small layering effusion with improved aeration at both lung bases since
 the prior study.  No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Patchy
 opacity right mid lung has resolved and likely reflected atelectasis. Nodular
 opacity left upper lobe again seen.
