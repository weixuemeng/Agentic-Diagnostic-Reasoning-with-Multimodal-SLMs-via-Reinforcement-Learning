                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female on BiPAP with hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lungs are hyperinflated and
 demonstrate diffuse bronchiectasis and peribronchial wall thickening, findings
 consistent with COPD.  A left basilar opacity is of uncertain etiology. 
 Though atelectasis and pneumonia should be considered, scarring is also a
 possibility given the adjacent tenting of the left hemidiaphragm.  No
 pneumothorax is evident.  There is no pulmonary edema.  there is a possible
 small left pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Hyperinflation and bronchiectasis related to COPD
 2. Left basilar opacity is of uncertain etiology.  Atelectasis, pneumonia or
 scarring are possible.
