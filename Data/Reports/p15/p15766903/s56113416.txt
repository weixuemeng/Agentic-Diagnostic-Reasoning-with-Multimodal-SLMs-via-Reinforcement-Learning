                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD, presents with low-grade fever, hypoxia and elevated white
 blood count, crackles on left base.  Interval change after hydration.  Rule
 out pneumonia.  Evaluate pulmonary nodule at the oblique view.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increased heterogeneous opacification in the left lower
 lobe and lingula consistent with pneumonia.  Previously identified nodular
 opacity in the right lower lung may correspond with the nipple shadow;
 however, other nodular opacities are seen in the right lower lung and the left
 upper lung on oblique views and given the patient's underlying chronic lung
 disease, would recommend a CT to evaluate.  Severe background emphysematous
 changes are not significantly changed from yesterday.  Normal heart size. 
 Tortuous aorta with atherosclerotic calcification at the aortic knob is
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left lower lobe and lingular pneumonia.
 2.  Previously identified nodular opacity in the right lower lung may
 represent a nipple shadow; however, other nodular opacities in the right lower
 lung and the left upper lung are seen on oblique views and given the patient's
 underlying lung disease, a CT is recommended to evaluate.
