                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, oxygen saturations ___% on room air. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia, CHF, pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates severe
 background emphysematous changes with relative lucency of the lungs and
 increased reticular nodular opacifications in the lung bases, left greater
 than right, the latter possibly representing  developing infectious process or
 simply atelectasis.  Focal nodular opacification projecting over the right
 lower lung.  Unclear if this is within the lung parenchyma or external to
 patient.  Not present on prior chest CTs; recommend reevaluation with oblique
 radiographs or non-emergent chest CT.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Stable severe background emphysematous changes with minimally increased
 opacification in the left lung base may reflect developing infectious process
 or relate to chronic background scarring.  
 2. 1-cm nodule projecting over right lower lung.  Recommend reevaluation with
 oblique radiographs or non-emergent dedicated chest CT.
