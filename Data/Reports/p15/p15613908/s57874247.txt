                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with paranoid schizophrenia, recent O2
 requirement.  // cough
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP view of the chest provided.
 
 Compared to prior study, the degree of diffuse interstitial opacity is largely
 unchanged.  However, more confluent opacity in the left lung base is seen,
 which could suggest atelectasis versus developing pneumonia. No large pleural
 effusions are seen.  Chronic dislocation of the right shoulder is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Largely unchanged diffuse interstitial abnormality, likely chronic
 interstitial lung disease.
 2. Left lung base opacity, cannot exclude superimposed atelectasis or
 developing pneumonia.
