                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pmh of scheizophrenia, COPD P/W with
 altered mental status and cough  // ?pneumonia     ?pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Evaluation is limited due to patient rotation. Additionally, the inspiratory
 lung volumes are decreased with resultant bronchovascular crowding and
 accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is opacification of
 the left lung base greater than the right superimposed on background diffuse
 interstitial abnormality.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 There are multiple right-sided rib fractures without significant callus
 formation, which are indeterminate in age.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Technically limited study with opacification of the left lung base likely
 representing pneumonia superimposed on diffuse interstitial lung disease.
 2.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures, which are indeterminate in age. 
 Recommend clinical correlation for tenderness on physical exam.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___
 telephone on ___ at 8:35 AM, 30 minutes after discovery of the findings.
