                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with GI bleed, now intubated for respiratory
 support.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes,
 likely secondary to poor inspiration.  Pulmonary vascular congestion has
 improved since previous imaging.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is a patchy opacity in the left lung base, consistent
 with atelectasis.  There has been interval intubation with the endotracheal
 tube now 2.7 cm above the carina with the tip pointing towards the right wall
 of the trachea.  There is an NG tube visualized entering the stomach and
 passing out of view.  Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval intubation with improving pulmonary vascular congestion.
