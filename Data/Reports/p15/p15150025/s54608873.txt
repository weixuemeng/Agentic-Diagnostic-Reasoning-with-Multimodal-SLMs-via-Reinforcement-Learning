                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female on Coumadin status post fall onto left knee
 and right lower back
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is probable hyperinflation with background COPD.  There are diffusely
 increased interstitial markings, with more pronounced bibasilar opacities,
 which may represent atelectasis or aspiration in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  No substantial pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. Heart
 size is mild to moderately enlarged.  Aorta is calcified and slightly
 unfolded.  No acute osseous abnormalities identified.  Severe right
 glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis noted.  Rounded lucency projecting over the
 left cardiophrenic region raises the possibility of a small hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute osseous abnormalities.  Correlation with any specific site of
 symptoms is requested for further assessment.
 2.  Probable background COPD and chronic lung disease.  Diffusely increased
 interstitial markings could relate to this, but may also reflect an element of
 CHF.
 3.  Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis, or alternatively aspiration
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
 4.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly.
 5.  No focal consolidation or gross effusion.
 6.  Possible small hiatal hernia.
