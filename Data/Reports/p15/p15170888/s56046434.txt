                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with dry cough, evaluate lungs.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bibasilar bronchovascular crowding with exaggeration of the heart contour is
 due to low lung volumes.  Under those circumstances, the lungs are otherwise
 clear.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 There are no significant cardiopulmonary findings except for low lung volumes.
