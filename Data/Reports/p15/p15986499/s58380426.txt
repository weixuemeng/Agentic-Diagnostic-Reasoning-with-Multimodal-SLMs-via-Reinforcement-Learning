                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fatigue, possible pneumonia in left base.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again
 hyperexpansion of the lungs with small bilateral pleural effusions and
 compressive atelectasis at the bases.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 persists and there is some engorgement of pulmonary vessels consistent with
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 There is poor visualization of the left heart border, though some of this may
 merely be an overlying external tube.  On the lateral view, there is not
 convincing evidence of a lingular pneumonia.
