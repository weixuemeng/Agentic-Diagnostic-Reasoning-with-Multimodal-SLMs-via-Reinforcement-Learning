 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fatigue, getting V/Q scan for PE.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is enlargement of the
 bilateral pulmonary arteries, potentially consistent with pulmonary
 hypertension.  Areas of atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung regions.  Mild
 fluid overload cannot be excluded.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
 No evidence of pneumonia.
