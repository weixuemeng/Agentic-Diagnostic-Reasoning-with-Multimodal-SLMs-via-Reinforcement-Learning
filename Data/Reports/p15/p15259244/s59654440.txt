 AP CHEST, 3:35 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hemoptysis, question interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Since consolidation has largely cleared from the right lung base since ___, this was presumably either dependent edema alone or dependent edema and
 atelectasis.  Minimal interstitial edema remains, but the left lower lobe is
 much better aerated today.  The heart is mildly to moderately enlarged.  No
 pneumothorax.  Dual-channel dialysis line ends in the right atrium.
