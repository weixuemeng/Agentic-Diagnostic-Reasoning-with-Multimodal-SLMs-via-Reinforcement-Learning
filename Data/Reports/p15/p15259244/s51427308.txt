                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:24 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  New Dobbhoff tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___, 2:57 p.m.:
 
 Tip of the new Dobbhoff feeding tube, with a wire stylet in place, ends in the
 mid-to-low stomach.  Right internal jugular sheath ends at the junction of the
 brachiocephalic veins and the right supraclavicular dialysis catheter orifices
 are in the right atrium.  A small-to-moderate right and moderate left pleural
 effusion are slightly larger than earlier in the day.  Left perihilar
 consolidation, probably atelectasis, is unchanged.  There is probably no
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Moderate postoperative widening of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, which progressed after tracheal extubation is
 stable since earlier in the day, but should be followed to exclude mediastinal
 bleeding.
