                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP portable view of the chest moderate left pleural effusion, essentially
 unchanged since prior exam.  Left lung base consolidation is present.  No
 large right pleural effusion is seen.  Peripheral right lung base opacity is
 more conspicuous since prior exam.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists and mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema is relatively similar.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unchanged.  Aortic valve calcifications are seen.  Multiple
 surgical clips project over cardiac silhouette compatible with prior CABG. 
 Sternotomy wires appear intact.  The mitral valve prosthesis is in place. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  In comparison to ___ exam, moderate left pleural effusion, mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema, and cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 2.  Left lung base consolidation, likely collapse or superimposed infection.
 
 3.  Right lung base peripheral opacity more conspicuous since prior exam and
 may represent infection, infarction or organizing pneumonia.
