                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cellulitic left lower lobe infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is cardiomegaly.  The
 patient is status post sternotomy, with prosthetic valve.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  There is a
 moderate to moderately large left effusion layering along the left chest wall
 and left apex, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle is present.  There is atelectasis at
 the right base.  There is straightening of the AP window on the left and
 prominence of the right hilum.  This could reflect pulmonary hypertension.  A
 dual lumen right-sided catheter is present, distal tip overlying the right
 atrium.
 
 A slightly displaced left posterolateral third rib fracture again noted,
 unchanged.  This was present on a chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Continued CHF, probably slightly worse compared with ___.
 2.  Left pleural fluid/thickening, left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, overall similar.
