                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Peritoneal dialysis, hypertension, and fever.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Post-sternotomy wires and replaced most likely mitral valve are unchanged in
 appearance.  No progression of interstitial pulmonary edema is demonstrated
 and might reflect need for dialysis.  Bilateral pleural effusions, right more
 than left, have developed in the interim, most likely small to moderate in
 size.  No new focal consolidation to suggest infectious process is seen with
 re-assessment after dialysis is required.
