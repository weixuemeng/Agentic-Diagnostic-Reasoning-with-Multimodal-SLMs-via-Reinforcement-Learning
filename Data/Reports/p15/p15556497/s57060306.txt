                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with endotracheal tube status post bronchoscopy
 for collapsed left lower lobe.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left subclavian central venous line terminates in the upper SVC. The study is
 slightly limited secondary to rotation.  Obscuration of left hemidiaphragm and
 opacification of the retrocardiac region represents persistent left lower lobe
 collapse.  Layering effusion of the left lung in conjunction with known
 multiple left rib fractures is concerning for growing pneumothorax, although
 may be due to supine positioning.  The right lung is essentially clear with
 heterogeneous right basilar opacity which may represent atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Layering effusion of the left lung with adjacent rib fractures raises the
 concern for growing hemothorax.  Dedicated upright chest radiograph can be
 obtained to evaluate for true size of left pleural effusion rather than
 apparent increase in size due to supine positioning.
