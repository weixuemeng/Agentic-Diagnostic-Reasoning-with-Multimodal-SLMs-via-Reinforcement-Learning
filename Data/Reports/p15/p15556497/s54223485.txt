                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multiple rib fractures, intubated. Evaluate
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors from the preceding days
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube again terminates less than 2 cm from the carina.  Enteric
 tube terminates beyond the diaphragm, out of the field-of-view.  Left
 subclavian central venous line terminates in the mid SVC.  Left lower lobe
 collapse and interstitial edema is again noted.  Increasing density of the
 right infrahilar and left suprahilar regions may reflect edema, however
 consider infection.  Multiple left rib fractures are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increasing bilateral perihilar opacities could reflect fluid overload,
 however infection is a strong consideration.
 2.  Endotracheal tube terminating less than 2 cm from the carina, as before. 
 Consider retraction.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Nurse ___
 on the telephone on ___ at 10:07 AM, 2 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
