 positioning.
 
 A left apical chest tube has been placed.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged. 
 Endotracheal tube ends 2.0 cm above the carina.  Partially image nasoenteric
 tube.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains prominent.  Possible slight
 left-sided pleural thickening, particularly in the upper chest.  There is
 prominence of the pulmonary vessels and increased retrocardiac density, though
 the significance of these findings, given the degree of low inspiratory
 volumes, is uncertain.
 
 Multiple displaced left rib fractures again seen associated with subcutaneous
 gas.  Known right-sided rib fractures not well seen on the current
 radiographs.  A displaced left humeral neck fracture and left scapular
 fracture re- demonstrated.
