 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever and crackles.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.

 an area of consolidation with air bronchograms that also correlates to a dual
 density in the anterior superior portion of the heart; these findings are
 compatible with right middle lobe consolidation.  Additionally opacity in the
 retrocardiac region which projects on lateral view over the spine is
 compatible with a left lower lobe consolidation.  Trace pleural effusion is
 seen on the left.  There is no large pneumothorax.
