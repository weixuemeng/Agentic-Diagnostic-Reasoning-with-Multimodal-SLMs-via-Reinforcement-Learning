                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Multifocal pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS: 
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  A trace left-sided pleural effusion may have
 decreased slightly.  A patchy opacity in the left lower lobe appears similar. 
 A vague opacity in the lingula is similar to perhaps minimally improved.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No evidence for progression of multifocal pneumonia.
