                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is a dexropositioning of the
 heart and mediastinal structures.  The heart is moderately tortuous. 
 Calcifications are noted in the arch.  There is marked dilatation of the
 esophagus with air-fluid levels that are prominent along the right upper
 lateral margin of the mediastinum as well as a large gas bubble protruding
 into the base of the neck.  Aside from a patchy associated right mid lung
 opacification suggesting minor atelectasis or scarring, the lungs appear
 otherwise clear.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 hyperinflation is present.  The bones appear demineralized.  There is minimal
 loss in vertebral body height along the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Markedly dilated esophagus with air-fluid levels, as well as
 large gas bubble protruding into the base of the neck.  This appearance could
 be seen with achalasia, although the exact role of the bubble in the neck is
 uncertain.  Correlation with clinical history is recommended with
 consideration of further imaging if needed clinically particularly if the
 anatomy is not already understood.
