                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis and ESRD status
 post liver/renal transplant, here with abdominal pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a right sided dialysis catheter with distal tip overlying the
 right atrium. An enteric tube is again seen coursing inferiorly, with distal
 tip projecting over the approximate location of the ligament of Treitz.
 Multiple median sternotomy wires are again identified. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are stable. Aortic arch calcifications are again noted. The
 bilateral hila are within normal limits. The lungs are clear. There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Subtle opacity overlying the right lower lung
 likely reflects layering right pleural effusion, better assessed on same-day
 CT scan. There is no pneumothorax or radiographic evidence of left pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable support devices. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Moderate
 right layering pleural effusion is better seen on same-day CT scan.
