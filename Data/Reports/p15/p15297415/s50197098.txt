                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p LKTx, c/f diaphragmatic palsy  // Evaluate for
 diaphragmatic palsy, inspiratory/experiatory films
 
 COMPARISON:  Previous study from earlier the same day
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There was limited voluntary inspiratory and expiratory effort, limiting
 assessment of diaphragmatic excursion. Fluoroscopic evaluation would be more
 sensitive for detecting clinically suspected diaphragmatic palsy.  Exam is
 otherwise remarkable for interval apparent removal of right pleural catheter
 with no visible pneumothorax.
