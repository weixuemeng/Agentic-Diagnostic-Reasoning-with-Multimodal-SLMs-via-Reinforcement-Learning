 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with mri concerning for epidural abscess/hematoma
 with new onset afib with crackles on exam bilat R>L  // eval for infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  None avail
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is
 accompanied by asymmetrically distributed alveolar opacities predominantly in
 the right lung.  Considering bilateral interstitial opacities, small to
 moderate right pleural effusion, and history of cardiovascular disease, this
 may represent asymmetrical pulmonary edema.  Short-term followup radiographs
 after diuresis would be helpful to exclude other superimposed process such as
 aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia.
