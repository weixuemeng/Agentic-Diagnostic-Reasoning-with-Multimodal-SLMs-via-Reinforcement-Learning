                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with heart failure and right pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate interval increase
 in a now moderate to large right pleural effusion with collapse of the right
 middle and lower lobes.  A right tunneled IJ hemodialysis catheter is
 unchanged in appearance with its tip projecting over the expected position of
 the right atrium.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size, the
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There is calcification of the aortic arch,
 and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal. 
 The lungs are otherwise clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval increase in now moderate to large right pleural effusion with
 adjacent right middle and lower lobar collapse, likely chronic.
 2.  Unchanged appearance of tunneled right IJ hemodialysis catheter, the tip
 of which is projecting over the right atrium.
