                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Substernal chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker
 device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  The heart size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous and
 calcified.  Again demonstrated are fibrotic changes within the right lung base
 which appear similar when compared to the prior radiograph.  There is likely
 minimal atelectasis in the left lung base.  No pulmonary edema, focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change from the prior study with
 continued right basilar fibrotic changes.
