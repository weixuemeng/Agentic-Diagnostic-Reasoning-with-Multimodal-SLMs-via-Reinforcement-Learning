 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxemia, hypertension, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 2:39 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 slightly decreased, which could potentially be caused by decreased ventilatory
 pressures.  As a consequence, the bilateral parenchymal opacities appear
 slightly denser than on the previous image.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.  No new parenchymal opacities have newly occurred. 
 No pleural effusions are seen.  The monitoring and support devices are
 constant.
