                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Lightheadedness and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker is noted with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which is stable.  The aorta remains
 tortuous.  There is mild pulmonary edema and a small right pleural effusion. 
 Previously noted left pleural effusion is not clearly seen on the current
 study.  Patchy ill-defined opacity in the right base persists and is likely
 due to atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with small right pleural effusion and right
 basilar opacification, possibly reflecting atelectasis, though infection is
 not excluded.  Previously noted small left pleural effusion appears resolved.
