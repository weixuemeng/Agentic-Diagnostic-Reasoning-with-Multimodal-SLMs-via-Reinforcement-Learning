                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with sepsis and hypoxemia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained. 
 Aeration of the lungs has improved since ___.  In particular the
 apices are better aerated.  Persistent alveolar opacity remains in a bibasilar
 predominance.  Small right effusion, if any, is unchanged.  There is no new
 abnormality of the heart or mediastinum.  There is no pneumothorax or
 consolidation.  An endotracheal tube remains in the upper airway.  An enteric
 catheter extends inferiorly out of field of view.  Right-sided PICC line tip
 terminates in the low SVC.  Pacemaker leads are in unchanged positions. 
 Median sternotomy wires are intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of the apices since ___.  Extensive
 bilateral dense consolidations remain at the bases.  Given rapid improvement,
 TRALI or ARDS are more likely etiologies than pneumonia.
