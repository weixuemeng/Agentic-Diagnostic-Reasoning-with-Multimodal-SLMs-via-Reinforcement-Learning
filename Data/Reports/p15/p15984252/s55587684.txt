                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with fever and dizziness.  Evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There is a vague opacity in the right
 lung base at the cardiophrenic angle which is slightly more conspicuous as
 compared to previous exams but may be secondary to summation of shadows.  In
 the lateral view, there may be very minimal increase in opacity of the
 anterior cardiophrenic angle, stable to minimally increased compare to prior,
 likely artifactual.  No other focal opacities identified.  Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in relative opacity at the right cardiophrenic
 angle is more likely artifactual and summation of overlapping shadows, but in
 the appropriate clinical setting and early right middle lobe pneumonia is not
 entirely excluded, although felt less likely.
