                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  ET tube and NG tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to CT abdomen from
 ___.
 
 The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The ET tube tip is 2.7 cm above the
 carina.  The heart size is unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  Left lower lobe
 opacity seen on the CT abdomen is not appreciated on the chest radiograph,
 most likely due to its posterior location hidden by the cardiac silhouette.
