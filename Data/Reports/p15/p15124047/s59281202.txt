                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:12 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with abdomen and chest pain, with palpitations. 
 Rule out rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging:
 
 Heart may be slightly enlarged, though the ___ are exaggerated by AP
 and supine positioning and low lung volumes.  Lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural abnormality.  Hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.  I see no
 displaced rib fracture, but conventional bedside chest radiographs are not
 designed for detection of subtle chest cage injury.
 
 No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
