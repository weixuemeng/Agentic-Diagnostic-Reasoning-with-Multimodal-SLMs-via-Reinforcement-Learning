                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain after motor vehicle collision.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. Lung volumes are low which causes crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures, but there is no evidence of overt pulmonary edema.
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Bilateral pleural thickening or
 subpleural fat is noted laterally. Multilevel degenerative changes are seen
 throughout the thoracic spine. No displaced fractures are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis. No displaced fractures are visualized.
