                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is borderline in size.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear within normal limits.  A patchy left lower lung opacity is
 probably in the left lower lobe.  On the right, more extensive opacification
 along the right mid lung is probably posterior, but not well seen on the
 lateral view, although most likely referring primarily to the superior segment
 of the left lower lobe.  The chest is hyperinflated.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures appear within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal opacities suggesting pneumonia, although opacities
 appear probably for the most part in dependent areas, and in the setting of
 altered mental status, aspiration pneumonitis is an additional consideration.
