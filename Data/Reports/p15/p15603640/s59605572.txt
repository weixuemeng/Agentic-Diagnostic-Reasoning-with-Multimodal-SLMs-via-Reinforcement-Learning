                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pleural effusions, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 patient is rotated slightly to the right.  There is opacification of most of
 the right hemithorax with volume loss seen, possibly underlying fluid;
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Correlate with history of prior
 procedure to the right hemithorax.  There is a trace left pleural effusion. 
 The right aspect of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is not well assessed due
 to the right hemithorax opacity, although the left aspect of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  The left hilum is slightly
 prominent, which may be due to pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Single-lead
 left-sided pacemaker, with lead extending to the expected position of the
 right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax with small
 area of aeration in the right upper to mid lung with volume loss and shift of
 the mediastinum to the right, query previous procedure on the right
 hemithorax.  There is likely underlying pleural fluid, underlying
 consolidation not excluded.
