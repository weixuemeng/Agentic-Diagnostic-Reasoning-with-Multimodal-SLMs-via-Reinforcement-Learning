  Focal mass in right upper lobe with miliary pattern of nodules in both lungs.
  Differential considerations include infectious (TB, varicella, influenza,

 HISTORY:  Cough, congestion.  Question pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a focal, poorly-defined mass in the right upper lobe measuring up to
 3.8-cm and a diffuse miliary pattern of micronodules throughout both lungs. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is no evidence of effusion
 or pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities are present. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Focal right upper lobe mass with milliary pattern of nodules in both lungs. 
 Differential considerations include infectious (TB, varicella, influenza, and
 disseminated fungal disease), metastatic disease (lung, particularly given the
 presence of a focal mass, thyroid, breast, or melanoma) or sarcoid.  Could
 consider chest CT  for further evaluatation.
