                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with NSCLC, s/p biopsy of LLL nodule. Trace PTX
 on immediate post procedure CT.  // Assess for pneumothorax 1 hour post
 biopsy. Please obtain at 11:50 am.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable semi upright chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 1 hr prior to this examination, the patient underwent CT-guided biopsy of the
 left lobe pulmonary nodule with a trace medial left pneumothorax on post
 procedure images.  No pneumothorax is evident on this examination.  Heart size
 and mediastinal contours appear within normal limits.  Diffuse opacity
 throughout the lungs is consistent with known nodular pulmonary disease.  In
 addition, superimposed nodular densities correspond to macroscopic nodules
 seen previously at CT.  There is no pleural effusion.  Osseous structures
 appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax.
