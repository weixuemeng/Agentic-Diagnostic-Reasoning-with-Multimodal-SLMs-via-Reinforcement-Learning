 HISTORY:  New hypoxia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from the same day at 10:17 AM. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The endotracheal tube is in the lower trachea at 1.7 cm from the carina. 
 Enteric tube tip appears well positioned within the stomach.  Otherwise,
 little change comparison prior study from the same day with low lung volumes
 and though focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  As previously
 noted, projection of the lateral margin of the thoracic aorta extending
 laterally beyond the curvilinear calcifications at the arch is not clearly
 evaluated today due to overlying mediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube tip is in the lower trachea at 1.7 cm from the carina. 
 Retraction by at least 2.0 cm is recommended. 
 
 2.  Enteric tube is now well positioned.
