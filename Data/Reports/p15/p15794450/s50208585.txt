 There is unchanged dense retrocardiac opacification, either atelectasis or
 infection.  Minimal right lower lung atelectasis is not significantly changed.
 There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The degree of
 cardiac enlargement is not significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Low lung volumes.  Unchanged dense retrocardiac opacification, consistent
 with either atelectasis or infection.
 
 2.  Unchanged minimal right lower lung atelectasis.
