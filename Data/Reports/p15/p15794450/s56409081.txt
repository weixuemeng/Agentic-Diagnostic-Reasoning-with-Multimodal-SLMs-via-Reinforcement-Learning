                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluation for interval change in an intubated patient with altered
 mental status and an intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable AP upright view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the prior
 studies.  An endotracheal tube ends 4 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube
 ends in the mid portion of the stomach.  Low lung volumes persist and
 exaggerate the mediastinal and cardiac contours that are unchanged.  A
 retrocardiac opacity is unchanged and likely represents atelectasis or
 infection.  There is a new small left pleural effusion.  Right lower lobe
 atelectasis has minimally improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Endotracheal tube ends 4 cm above the carina.  
 
 2. Persistent low of lung volumes and retrocardiac opacity are unchanged.  
 
 3.  New small left pleural effusion.
