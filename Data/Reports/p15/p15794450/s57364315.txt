                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Neurologic changes, intubated.  Assess for change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube ends 2.8 cm above the level of the carina. 
 An enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm and out of the
 field of view inferiorly.  Dense retrocardiac opacification could reflect
 atelectasis versus a consolidation, not significantly changed.  There is
 minimal right lower lung atelectasis.  The degree of cardiac enlargement is
 not significantly changed.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  No definite
 pleural effusions are seen.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No significant interval change in dense retrocardiac opacification,
 possibly atelectasis versus infection.
 
 2.  Unchanged minimal right lower lung atelectasis.
