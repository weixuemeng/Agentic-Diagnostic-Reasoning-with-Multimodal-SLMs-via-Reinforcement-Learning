 Low lung volumes are present. The heart size is unchanged appearing borderline
 enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema.  A patchy opacity is
 demonstrated in the left lower lobe, potentially due to atelectasis though
 infection cannot be completely excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is visualized. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
