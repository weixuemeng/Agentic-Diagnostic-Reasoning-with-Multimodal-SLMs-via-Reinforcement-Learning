                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Postoperative day 5 after recent surgery presenting with fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including mild to
 moderate cardiomegaly. There is diffuse bilateral lung opacification which is
 more suggestive of pulmonary edema than pneumonia although there may be a
 confluent component in the right lower lung for which the possibility of
 developing pneumonia could be considered. There is also retrocardiac
 opacification but not well delineated but commonly opacity in this area is due
 to atelectasis and this appears decreased.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings most suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema. Coinciding pneumonia is
 not excluded and may be appropriate to obtain short-term follow-up radiographs
 to reassess.
