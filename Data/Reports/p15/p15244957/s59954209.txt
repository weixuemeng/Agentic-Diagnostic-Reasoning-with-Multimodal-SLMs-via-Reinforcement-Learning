 back to approximately 4 cm above the carina. Right IJ catheter or sheath
 extends to the confluence with the SVC. Nasogastric tube is in good position.
 Retrocardiac opacification with blunting of the costophrenic angle persists,
 consistent with pleural effusion and substantial volume loss in the left lower
 lobe. There is increased opacification at the right base, worrisome for
 developing aspiration or infectious pneumonia.
