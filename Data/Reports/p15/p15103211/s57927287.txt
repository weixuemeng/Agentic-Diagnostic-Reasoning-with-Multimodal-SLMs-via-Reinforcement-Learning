 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Linear density at the right base likely

 pneumonia.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 exaggerated by low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion, pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax is detected on these views.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with basilar atelectasis and retrocardiac
 density, which could represent atelectasis or pneumonia.
 
 Findings were reported to ___ by ___ by telephone at
