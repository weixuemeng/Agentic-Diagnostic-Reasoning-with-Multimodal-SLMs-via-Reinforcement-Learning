 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  The aorta is tortuous.  There has
 been interval increase in right middle lobe and bibasilar opacities, right
 greater than left, consistent with worsening pneumonia and atelectasis.  The
 upper lobes are clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  If any, there is a small
 right effusion.
