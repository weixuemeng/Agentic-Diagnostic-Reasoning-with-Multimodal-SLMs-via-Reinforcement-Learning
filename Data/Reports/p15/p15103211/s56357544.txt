                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, evaluation for left lower lobe
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral parenchymal
 opacities at the lung bases, left more than right, are virtually unchanged in
 extent and severity.  Although these opacities are likely to have an
 atelectatic component, they could well represent pneumonia.  Bilaterally,
 there is blunting of the costophrenic sinuses, likely reflecting small pleural
 effusions.
 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  No evidence for hilar or mediastinal abnormalities.
