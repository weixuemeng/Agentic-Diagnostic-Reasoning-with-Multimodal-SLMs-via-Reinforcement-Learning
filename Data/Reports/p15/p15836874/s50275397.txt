                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with palpitations.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is linear right
 mid-to-lower lung opacity most likely due to atelectasis versus scarring. 
 Elsewhere, lungs are clear without consolidation or pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Mild blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles may be due to
 trace effusions or atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
