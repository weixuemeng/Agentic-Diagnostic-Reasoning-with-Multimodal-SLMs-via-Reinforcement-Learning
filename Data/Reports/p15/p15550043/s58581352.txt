                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been previous median sternotomy and coronary artery
 bypass surgery.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. 
 Worsening predominantly linear opacities in the mid and lower lungs
 bilaterally are present, but there are no confluent areas of consolidation. 
 Apparent bronchial wall thickening is present in the lower lobes, best
 visualized on the lateral view.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Multifocal linear opacities suggestive of atelectasis.
 
 2.  Lower lobe predominant bronchial wall thickening, which could potentially
 represent bronchitis in the appropriate clinical setting.
