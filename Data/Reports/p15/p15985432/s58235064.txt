                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea and palpitations
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lung volumes are low which
 somewhat limit the evaluation.  Allowing for this, there is no focal
 consolidation, large effusion or pneumothorax.  No signs of congestion or
 edema.  Heart and mediastinal contours are normal.  Bony structures are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute findings.  Low lung volumes limits assessment.
