                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // eval CHF, pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is marked thoracic scoliosis. Linear opacities at the left lung base
 likely relates to atelectasis, although appear more conspicuous as compared to
 the prior study and a subtle underlying infection is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting. Initially, there is very subtle left perihilar
 opacity. No pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 There is no pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette appears top-normal to
 mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Aortic knob is
 calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked scoliosis. Left basilar linear opacities likely due to
 atelectasis/scarring, however, appear more conspicuous as compared to the
 prior study. Additional subtle left perihilar opacity. Subtle underlying
 infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 No pulmonary edema.
