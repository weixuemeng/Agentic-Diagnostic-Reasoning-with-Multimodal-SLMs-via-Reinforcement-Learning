                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Vomiting and vertigo, fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Thoracic
 scoliosis is again seen.  Bilateral lower lung atelectasis is again seen,
 somewhat increased on the left.  Left base opacity likely represents
 atelectasis; however, underlying infectious process is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting, though felt less likely.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There
 is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Biapical pleural thickening is again seen.
