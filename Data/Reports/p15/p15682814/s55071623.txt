                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 3.5 cm above
 the carina. A right internal jugular introducer catheter terminates in the
 lower superior vena cava. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach.
 Endovascular aortic valve prosthesis is noted. The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged. There is probably a small pleural effusion
 with atelectasis on the left. Small right-sided pleural effusion is no longer
 conspicuous. Although a right upper lobe opacity is substantially less than
 distinct than before, there is moderate, somewhat increased diffuse
 predominantly central opacification suggesting worsening pulmonary edema. The
 bones appear demineralized with multiple incompletely characterized
 compression deformities since sites of prior vertebroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post endotracheal intubation. Findings consistent with moderate to
 severe pulmonary edema. Improvement in focal right upper lobe opacity which
 may support that the differential of recent chemical aspiration pneumonitis in
 the appropriate clinical circumstances.
