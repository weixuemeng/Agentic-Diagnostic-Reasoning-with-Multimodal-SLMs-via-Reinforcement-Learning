                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall onto with, head injury, left arm pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient's hand overlies the left upper hemithorax on the frontal view and
 the patient's arm overlies the chest on the lateral view, partially obscuring
 the view.  Given this, scattered areas of linear atelectasis all are seen
 without definite focal consolidation.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles on
 the lateral view suggests small pleural effusions.  Prosthetic aortic valve is
 similar in appearance and position as compared to ___.  Multiple
 compression deformities as well as prior kyphoplasty/vertebroplasties are not
 well assessed on this study.
