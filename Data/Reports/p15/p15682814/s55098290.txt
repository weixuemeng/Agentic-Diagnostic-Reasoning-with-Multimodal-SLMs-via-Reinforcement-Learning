  In comparison with the study of ___, 1. Moderate pulmonary edema with
  increased small left pleural effusion and stable trace right pleural effusion.
  2. Increase in left lower lobe opacity is most consistent with pleural fluid
  and atelectasis however superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
  3. Interval removal of endotracheal tube and enteric feeding tube. Right CVL
  tip in lower SVC.
  4. Several vertebroplasty levels are unchanged in appearance.
  5. Status post aortic valve replacement.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bilateral femur fractures, now s/p
 surgery, with SOB  // does this patient have volume overload evidence on cxr? 
 does this patient have volume overload evidence on cxr?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the the cardiac silhouette is more
 prominent and there is increasing pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural
 effusions more prominent on the left and bibasilar atelectatic changes.  In
 the retrocardiac region, extensive opacification could reflect developing
 consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting.
 The nasogastric tube has been removed an the right IJ sheath remains in
 position. Several vertebroplasties are again seen.
