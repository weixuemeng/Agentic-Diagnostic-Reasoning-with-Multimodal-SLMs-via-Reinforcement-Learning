                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient remains intubated. The balloon of the endotracheal tube seems
 somewhat overinflated. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach. A right
 internal jugular introducer catheter remains. Aortic valve prosthesis is also
 noted. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Right upper lung
 opacity has continued to improve. Left perihilar opacification shows apparent
 increased, particularly compared to the right, where aeration has markedly
 improved. However, it is possible that apparent increase in left perihilar
 opacification may reflect differences in orientation to some degree. There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked improvement in aeration in the right lung. Apparent increase in left
 perihilar opacification, although possibly due to differences in orientation.
 This appearance may be seen with improving pulmonary edema or persistent area
 of chemical aspiration pneumonitis.  Developing new area of pneumonia is not
 excluded. Correlation regarding interval circumstances is suggested.
 Short-term follow-up radiographs may be appropriate.  Possible overinflation
 of endotracheal tube cuff.
