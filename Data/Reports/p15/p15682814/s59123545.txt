                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:46 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old woman after catheterization with probable pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest read in conjunction with most recent prior chest
 imaging, a CT on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Given the patient's age, I doubt that the minimal interstitial
 abnormality visible is acute edema.  There is atelectasis at both lung bases,
 left greater than right.  Heart is mildly-to-moderately enlarged, comparable
 to the size on the chest CT in ___, which also showed substantial aortic
 valvular calcification, suggesting stenosis.  Pleural effusions are small if
 any.  No pneumothorax.  Cement vertebroplasty noted at multiple levels in the
 thoracic spine, as well as severely degenerated right shoulder.
