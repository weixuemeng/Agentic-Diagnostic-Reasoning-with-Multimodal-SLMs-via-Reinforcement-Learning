 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is

 is slight blunting of the costophrenic angles and small pleural effusions may
 be present.  There is central pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Gaseous distention of the stomach is seen along with coarse
 calcifications of the splenic artery.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe opacity raises concern for pneumonia.
 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles, trace effusion not excluded.  Central
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.
