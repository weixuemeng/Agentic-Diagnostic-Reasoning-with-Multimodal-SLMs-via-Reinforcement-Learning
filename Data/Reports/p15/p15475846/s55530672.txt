                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 18:06
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with MS flare, question infectious process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 18:42.
 
 A single AP portable upright chest film, ___ at 18:06 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Given lordotic technique and patient positioning, the lungs remain well
 inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely stable.  Lobulated contour to both
 hemidiaphragms is again seen suggestive of eventration.  No pleural effusions
 or pneumothoraces.  No acute bony abnormality.
