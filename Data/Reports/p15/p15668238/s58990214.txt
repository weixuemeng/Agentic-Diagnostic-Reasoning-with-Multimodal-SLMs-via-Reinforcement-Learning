                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with intubated.  Evaluate ETT.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright supine AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior imaging is available on PACS at the time of this
 dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ETT tip projects over the mid thoracic trachea.  An enteric tube projects over
 the midline and traverses the hemidiaphragm, although the tip is either the
 scope of this image.  A left upper extremity access PICC line terminates in
 the mid SVC.  Opacity in the left lower lobe with indistinctness of the left
 hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle could reflect a combination of
 atelectasis, consolidation, and effusion.  Right lower lung opacities are also
 noted. Although assessment is limited on AP view, the heart is perhaps
 slightly enlarged.  Interstitial edema is mild to moderate.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ETT over mid-thoracic trachea, 5 cm from carina.  1-2 cm advanced been may
 result in more optimal positioning.
 2.  Bilateral mild edema and lower lung airspace opacities with a left small
 pleural effusion - this could represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 scenario.
 3.  PICC line positioned appropriately.
