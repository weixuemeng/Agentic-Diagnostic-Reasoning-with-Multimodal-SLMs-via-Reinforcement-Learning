                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  AP and lateral chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Single portable upright chest radiograph was provided. The images
 are underpenetrated so detection of pulmonary edema is limited.  Streaky
 opacities at the bases may represent atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged allowing
 for differences in technique.  The bones are intact.  The imaged upper abdomen
 is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Limited study due to underpenetration. No overt pneumonia or
 failure.
