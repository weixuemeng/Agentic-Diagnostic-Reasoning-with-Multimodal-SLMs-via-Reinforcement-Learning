                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shock, intubated from outside hospital.  Evaluate tube position
 or presence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None  available.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  Lung volumes are low.  There are
 bibasilar heterogeneous opacities, which may represent atelectasis or
 consolidation.  There is also a subtle wedge-shaped opacity in the right mid
 lung field. This may represent focal consolidation, or effusion tracking
 within the minor fissure.  There are probable small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  There is mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement.  There is an
 endotracheal tube approximately 5 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube
 courses the esophagus and is coiled within the left upper quadrant of the
 abdomen, in the expected location of the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate position.
 2. Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis, although underlying
 aspiration and/or pneumonia could be present. 
 3. Small wedge-shaped opacity in the right mid lung field may be focal
 consolidation.  Recommend follow-up to resolution to exclude underlying
 pulmonary nodule.
 4. Possible small bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild central pulmonary
 vascular engorgement.
