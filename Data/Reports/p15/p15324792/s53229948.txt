                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 3:53 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with bilateral pneumonia, pulmonary vascular
 congestion, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study, ___ at 2:09 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube with its tip at the thoracic inlet.  Right internal jugular
 central line with its tip in the distal SVC.  Left internal jugular catheter
 has its tip in the distal SVC at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged. 
 Nasogastric tube remains in place with its tip below the diaphragm and the
 side port near the gastroesophageal junction.  There continues to be bilateral
 airspace process which is now worse on the right than the left, although is
 slightly less nodular in appearance.  These findings  could represent
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, although an infectious process cannot be entirely
 excluded, and therefore, clinical correlation is advised.  Linear opacity at
 the left base most likely represents subsegmental atelectasis.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in
 patient positioning.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  No large layering
 effusions.
