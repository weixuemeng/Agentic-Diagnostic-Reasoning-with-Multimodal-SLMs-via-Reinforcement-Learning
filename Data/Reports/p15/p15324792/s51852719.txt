 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:29 PM
  New OG tube terminates at the gastroesophageal junction with side port within
  the esophagus.  OG appears coiled in pharynx - catheter should be repositioned
  into the stomach.  Right IJ in mid SVC.  Left IJ at brachiocephalic SVC
  junction. ET tube 3.5 cm from carina.  Ovoid density in left mid lung appears
  to be attached to tubing - likely a support device overlying the patient.
  Additional catheter coursing across upper chest - also likely overlying the
  patient.  Increased left basilar consolidation. Apparent increase in pulmonary
  edema.  OG tube position communicated to ___ ICU RN (___) at 9:28 pm
  on ___ by telephone. ___ p_________________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:39 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new OG tube.  Check placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 12:29 p.m.:
 
 Nasogastric tube still loops widely in the hypopharynx, and ends in the distal
 esophagus.  Mild pulmonary edema has developed, moderate cardiomegaly has
 increased and moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged in position. 
 Lateral aspect right lower chest is excluded from the examination, so
 assessment of the size of right pleural effusion, is difficult to assess, but
 it is small and probably increased also.  No pneumothorax. A right internal
 jugular line tip projects over the mid-to-low SVC.
