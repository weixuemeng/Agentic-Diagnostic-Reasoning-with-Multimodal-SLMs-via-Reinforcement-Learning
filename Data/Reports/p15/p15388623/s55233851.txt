                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assess for PIC catheter placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates left PIC catheter projecting
 over mid SVC.   ___-mm distal end of the catheter appears hyperdense, which is
 likely due to catheter folding on itself.  No pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy tube
 is in place.  The patient is status post medial sternotomy.  Lung volumes are
 low.  No pleural effusions.  The upper lung heterogeneous opacities are
 unchanged.  Increased airspace opacities in the right lung base are noted. 
 Left upper lung is essentially clear with the exception of the left lung base
 opacities.  There is widening of the mediastinum and prominence of descending
 aorta, which likely relates to patient's positioning and is more conspicuous
 since prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left PIC catheter projects over mid SVC, however, its distal 10 mm tip
 appears hyperdense, which is likely due to catheter folding on itself.
 
 2.  Widened mediastinum and prominent descending aorta, more conspicuous since
 prior, which likely relates to patient positioning.  Repeat chest radiograph
 is recommended with better positioning to assess for possible underlying
 pathology.
 
 3.  Right lung opacities have been slightly increased since ___ exam, and
 likely reflect multifocal infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 11:00 a.m., ___ by phone at the
 time of discovery.
