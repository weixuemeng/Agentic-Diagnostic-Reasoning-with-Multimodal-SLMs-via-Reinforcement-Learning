                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Tracheostomy, respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Midline tracheostomy tube is seen.  The patient is status post
 interval placementof a left sided PICC, which has a sharp kink at its distal
 portion.  The left-sided PICC appears to course towards the proximal SVC and
 take a sharp kink and then head in a relative superior direction 8-mm.  PICC
 should be repositioned.  This finding was discussed with Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 8:38 p.m. via telephone two minutes after discovery.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The aorta is quite unfolded.  The
 aortic knob is prominent, probably due to underlying aneurysm.  No priors
 studies for comparison.  The patchy opacity projecting over the right lung
 could be due to sites of aspiration or infection.  No large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly
 enlarged.
