                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p hemipelvectomy w/ 5L EBL and large fluid
 shifts post-op now with SIRS  // signs of volume overload? infiltrate?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 7 cm above the carina and could be
 advanced slightly for standard positioning.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable.  Increasing opacity in the left mid and lower lung is a waxing and
 waning finding over the previous 2 radiographs in suggests the possibility of
 recurrent aspiration.  Right lung is markedly hyperexpanded but grossly clear.
 Possible small left pleural effusion, but no evidence of pneumothorax.
