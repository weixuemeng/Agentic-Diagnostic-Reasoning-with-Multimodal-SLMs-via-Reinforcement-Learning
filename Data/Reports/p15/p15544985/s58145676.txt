                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest pain  // eval chest pain
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Battery pack seen in overlying the left lung base, with lead extending
 superiorly apparently represents a left-sided vagus nerve stimulator, based on
 prior chest x-ray report.  A  Port-A-Cath type right subclavian central line
 is present, tip over proximal most SVC.  Its tip appears to lie slightly more
 proximal 1 on the prior film.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Heart size is prominent, but not frankly enlarged.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, without overt CHF, similar to prior.  Allowing for obscuration
 of the left lung base, no focal infiltrate or gross effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The Port-A-Cath tip lies slightly more proximal on today's exam.  Otherwise, I
 doubt significant interval change.  No acute pulmonary process is identified.
