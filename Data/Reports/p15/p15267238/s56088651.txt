                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post exploratory laparotomy.  Question interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube ends 3 cm above the carina.  Tip of the Swan-Ganz
 catheter remains in the proximal right pulmonary artery.  Right PICC line ends
 in the mid SVC.  NG tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  A left
 pacemaker with leads in the expected position of the right atrium and right
 ventricle is unchanged.  Compared with most recent prior radiograph, lung
 volumes are lower and as a consequence, there is a general increase in lung
 density.  In addition, there has been decrease in left upper lung opacity with
 increase in left lower lung opacity, which given the time course likely
 represents redistribution of pulmonary edema.  Severe cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decreased opacity in left upper lung and increased
 opacity in left lower lung likely represent redistribution of pulmonary edema
 given the time course.
