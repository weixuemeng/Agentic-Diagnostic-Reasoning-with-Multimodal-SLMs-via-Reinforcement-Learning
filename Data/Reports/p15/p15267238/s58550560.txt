 AP CHEST, 7:36 P.M., ___   
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after right PICC line.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 3:15 a.m. and 4:33 p.m.:
 
 Position of the right internal jugular line, in the upper right atrium, has
 not been disturbed by interval removal of the right PIC line.  It is roughly 8
 cm below the level of the carina and would need to be withdrawn 4 cm to place
 it in the low SVC.  Tip of an endotracheal tube is approximately 2 cm from the
 carina and should be withdrawn 2 cm to avoid unilateral intubation.  Upper
 enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Transvenous
 right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements. 
 Mild pulmonary edema and moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly are unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.  Small pleural effusions are presumed.
