 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A feeding tube has been placed, which coils in the stomach before
 traversing distally.  The tip of the catheter is not included on this
 radiograph but extends at least to the proximal duodenum.  Other indwelling
 devices are unchanged in position.  Persistent cardiomegaly, but slight
 improvement in degree of pulmonary edema accompanied by slight decrease in
 right pleural effusion which continues to have an intrafissural component.
