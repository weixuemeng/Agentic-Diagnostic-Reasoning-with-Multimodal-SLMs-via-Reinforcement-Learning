                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ESRD.  Followup pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed one hour earlier and the day
 before.
 
 Cardiomegaly is stable.  Pacemaker leads are in the standard position.  Right
 PICC tip is in the upper SVC.  Small-to-moderate right and small left
 effusions are more conspicuous due to the difference in positioning of the
 patient.  Bibasilar atelectasis are larger on the right side, grossly
 unchanged.  Continuous improvement of now mild pulmonary edema.  There is
 persistent opacity in the left upper lobe and right perihilar regions which
 could be due to pulmonary edema, pneumonia still could be present and
 continued followup is recommended.  There is no pneumothorax or new lung
 abnormalities.
