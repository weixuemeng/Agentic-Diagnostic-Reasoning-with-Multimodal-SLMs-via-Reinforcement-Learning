                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest CT from ___ as well as a chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  GI bleed, hemoptysis, lung cancer, G-tube, assess for
 progression of lung cancer or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Port-A-Cath
 projects over the right chest wall with catheter extending to the level of the
 low SVC.  There is right lung volume loss again noted.  Opacity in the right
 upper lung is again noted which likely reflects volume-related changes and
 bronchiectasis, possibly also loculated effusion as seen on prior CT.  In
 addition, there is blunting of the right CP angle, likely indicative of
 persistent effusion and mild associated compressive atelectasis.  There is no
 significant change from the prior study.  Left lung remains clear.  Heart and
 mediastinal contour appears unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable exam without definite signs of pneumonia or progression of
 disease.
