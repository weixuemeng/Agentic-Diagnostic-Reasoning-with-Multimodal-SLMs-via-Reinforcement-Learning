                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous image, there is unchanged evidence of
 right upper paramediastinal thickening and apical thickening, combined to
 substantial volume loss of the right upper lobe.  The hyperinflated right
 lower lobe and the left lung appear normal.  The right pleural effusion, not
 present at the previous exam, has re-occurred.  This leads to blunting of the
 costophrenic sinus and is better appreciated on the lateral than on the
 frontal image.  The extent of the effusion is comparable to ___,
 before right thoracocentesis.
 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged appearance of the hilar
 structures.
