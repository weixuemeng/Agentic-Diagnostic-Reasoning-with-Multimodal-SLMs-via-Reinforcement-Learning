                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided Port-A-Cath is in place with tip terminating in the
 lower superior vena cava with no visible pneumothorax.  Homogeneous opacity in
 right lung apex with associated traction bronchiectasis and upward retraction
 of the right hilum is consistent with post-radiation changes in this patient
 with history of previous radiation therapy to this region.  Approximately 1-cm
 diameter nodule in left suprahilar region is seen to better detail on prior CT
 of ___, which demonstrated several additional pulmonary nodules
 bilaterally, previously attributed to pulmonary metastases.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No focal areas of consolidation are identified within the lungs to
 suggest the presence of pneumonia, but standard PA and lateral chest
 radiographs may be helpful for more complete assessment of the lungs when the
 patient's condition permits.
