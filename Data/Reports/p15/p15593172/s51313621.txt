 process.  There is also some right upper lobe atelectasis and a small pleural
 effusion in the major fissure on the right.  There are no major changes to the
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Chest tube is seen again in place on the right. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked volume loss in right apex which could be old TB but is
 concerning for a neoplastic process.
