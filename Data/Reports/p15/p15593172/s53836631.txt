                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer with possible aspiration event.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior examination, there has been increase in size
 of right-sided pleural effusion as well as worsening of right base
 consolidation with mild rightward mediastinal shift.  The right main stem
 bronchus is difficult to visualize distally and may be plugged with mucus.  A
 previously described right apical pneumatocele is more fluid filled compared
 to prior study.  Post-radiation changes in the right lung are unchanged. 
 Pulmonary edema in the left lung is improved.  A small left-sided pleural
 effusion is unchanged.  A left-sided port remains in unchanged position with
 the tip at the cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing right base consolidation and effusion with slightly
 increased rightward mediastinal shift and difficult visualization of the right
 main stem bronchus suggesting collapse with airway obstruction from mucus
 plugging.
