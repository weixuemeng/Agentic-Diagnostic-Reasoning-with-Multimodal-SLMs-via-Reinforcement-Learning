 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:20 PM
  Diffuse osteopenia. Fracture of at least ___ mid posterior right-sided rib,
  possibly sixth rib of indeterminate age, but appears new since ___. 
  Additional rib fractures are difficult to exclude if high clinical concern for
  acute rib fractures, CT is more sensitive and should be considered.
  
  Small bilateral pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Right base
  opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, but
  underlying consolidation not excluded.
  
  Increased interstitial markings bilaterally likely combination of chronic lung
  disease and mild interstitial edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pectus excavatum s/p fall and anterior rib
 strike  // r/o acute pulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs remain hyperinflated.  Increased interstitial markings bilaterally
 likely due to combination of chronic lung disease and mild interstitial edema.
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  Right
 base opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis,
 but consolidation due to infection, aspiration, or pulmonary contusion not
 entirely excluded.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Biapical pleural
 thickening is again seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 Persistent loss of height of the mid to lower thoracic vertebral body. 
 Fracture of a mid posterior right rib, possibly the posterior right sixth rib
 is of indeterminate age, but appears new since the prior study.  Diffuse
 osteopenia.
