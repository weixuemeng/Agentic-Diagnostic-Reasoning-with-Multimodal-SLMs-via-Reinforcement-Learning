                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Several punctate rounded densities are noted
 projecting over the upper lobes bilaterally, more so on the right.  No focal
 consolidation is present.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Several punctate rounded densities within the upper lobes bilaterally, more so
 on the right.  These may reflect a small airways infectious or inflammatory
 process in the correct clinical setting.  Comparison with previous radiographs
 if available would be helpful.  Alternatively, follow up radiographs are
 suggested.
