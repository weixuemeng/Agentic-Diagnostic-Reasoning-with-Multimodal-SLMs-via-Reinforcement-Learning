                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single semi-erect AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  The patient is
 rotated to the right.  There are low lung volumes.  There is prominence of the
 central pulmonary vasculature.  There is also blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle suggesting a small right pleural effusion.  Right base
 opacity is seen which may be due to combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Additionally,
 left base opacity may be due to atelectasis, infection or aspiration.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
 Partially imaged is cervical spine hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes.  Small right pleural effusion and overlying atelectasis,
 right basilar opacity may represent combination of the above, although
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Patchy left base retrocardiac
 opacity, atelectasis versus infection or aspiration.
 
 2.  Central pulmonary vascular engorgement, may be accentuated by low lung
 volumes.  Suggest dedicated PA and lateral views when/if patient able.
