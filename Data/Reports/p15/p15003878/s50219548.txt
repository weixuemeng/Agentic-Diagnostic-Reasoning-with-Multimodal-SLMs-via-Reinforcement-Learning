                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Respiratory failure, evaluation of the chest tube
 placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The current study is suboptimal from a technical standpoint.  Within those
 limitations note is made of the presence of substantial subcutaneous air
 projecting over the entire chest.  The right chest tube is in unchanged
 position at the lower right hemithorax.  The left central venous line is
 projecting over the mid low SVC.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as
 well as there is no change in bibasal areas of atelectasis.  Pneumothorax
 cannot be assessed on this suboptimal study.  The NG tube tip is in the
 stomach.
