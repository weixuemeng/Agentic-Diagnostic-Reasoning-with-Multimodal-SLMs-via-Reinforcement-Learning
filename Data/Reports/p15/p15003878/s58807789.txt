                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiographs through ___ with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral lung volumes are very low.  An endotracheal tube terminates at the
 level of the clavicle approximately 6 cm above the carina.  Consider advancing
 ET tube by additional 2-3 cm for better seating.  Left subclavian line ends at
 the right upper or mid atrium.  Bilateral lung opacity may reflect pulmonary
 edema; however, given the low lung volumes, this appearance may be
 exaggerated.  A single right chest tube ends at right lung base.  Multiple rib
 fractures on the right side are seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 Subcutaneous emphysema persists along the right chest and in the axillary
 region, minimally improve3d.  Bibasilar atelectasis are similar.
