                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with history of trauma, multiple rib fractures and
 pulmonary contusion, in followup.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Lines and tubes are in place in standard position, unchanged.  There are
 persistent low lung volumes.  Bibasilar opacities have increased.  This could
 be due to worsening atelectasis and/or worsening still mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema and increasing small left and right pleural effusions. 
 Extensive subcutaneous bilateral gas has decreased.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.
