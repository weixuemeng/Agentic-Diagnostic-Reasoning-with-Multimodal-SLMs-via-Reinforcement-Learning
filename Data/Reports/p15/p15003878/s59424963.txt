 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post motor vehicle accident, difficult extubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:53 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated.  In addition, the right chest tube has been removed.  There is
 currently no evidence of pneumothorax.  The lung volumes have slightly
 increased.  Moderate cardiomegaly and bilateral areas of atelectasis, the
 presence of small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded.  No newly
 appeared opacities, no pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.
