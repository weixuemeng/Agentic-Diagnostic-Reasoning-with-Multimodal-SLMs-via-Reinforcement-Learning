                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ribs are ideally assessed on this conventional chest radiograph
 examination.  With this limitation in mind, known right-sided rib fractures
 are healing, and several remain mildly displaced.  No pneumothorax is
 identified, but there are persistent bilateral small pleural effusions
 present.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for technique. 
 Right hemidiaphragm is elevated anteriorly without change. Lucency through the
 manubrium on the lateral chest radiograph corresponds to a fracture on the
 prior outside chest CT of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Healing right rib fractures. Note that the ribs are not ideally assessed
 by chest radiography. If there is a clinical concern regarding new or
 displaced fractures, dedicated rib films may be considered.
 
 2.  Healing manubrial fracture.
 
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 4.  Persistent eventration right hemidiaphragm.
