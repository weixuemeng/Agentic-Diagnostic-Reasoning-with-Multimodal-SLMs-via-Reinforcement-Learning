                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with PICC placement and decreased UOP  // edema?
 PICC placement?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right PICC, which terminates in the low
 SVC/ cavoatrial junction, without evidence of pneumothorax.  There are low
 lung volumes.  Left mid to lower lung linear atelectasis/scarring is seen. 
 Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles persists suggesting small
 pleural effusions.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles suggests small
 pleural effusions.
 
 Right PICC terminates in the low SVC/cavoatrial junction without evidence of
 pneumothorax.
