                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p MVC, intubated, s/p new OGT placement  //
 eval OG tube placement      eval OG tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 a nasogastric tube that extends at least to the the level of the
 esophagogastric junction, where it crosses the lower margin of the image.  A
 in view of the abdomen would be necessary if the precise position of the tip
 is required.
 Otherwise little change.
