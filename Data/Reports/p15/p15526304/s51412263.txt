 overlying soft tissues although superimposed effusions are entirely possible. 
 Bilateral parenchymal opacities have likely progressed and are suggestive of
 edema.  Right PICC is identified however tip cannot be clearly delineated.

 Limited exam with  progression of pulmonary edema and possible bilateral
 effusions.
