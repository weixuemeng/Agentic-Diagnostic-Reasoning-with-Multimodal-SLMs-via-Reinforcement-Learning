                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural biopsy and chest tube placement  //
 R/O pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiograph from ___, there is been interval
 placement of a second left chest tube with associated subcutaneous emphysema
 in the left lateral chest wall.  Previously visualized left pigtail catheter
 is in unchanged position. Lung volumes remain low.  Linear opacity along the
 peripheral left lung is nonspecific, though could represent a loculated
 collection following pleural biopsy.  No large pneumothorax identified.  Mild
 atelectasis at the right base has somewhat increased, with interval
 development of plate-like atelectasis.  Left basilar atelectasis is unchanged.
 Bilateral pleural effusions persist.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval placement of left-sided chest tube.  No large pneumothorax
 identified.
 2. Linear opacity along the periphery of the left lung is nonspecific, though
 could represent a loculated fluid collection lung pleural biopsy.
 3. Persistent bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild interval worsening of right
 basilar atelectasis with interval development of platelike atelectasis. 
 Unchanged left basilar atelectasis.
