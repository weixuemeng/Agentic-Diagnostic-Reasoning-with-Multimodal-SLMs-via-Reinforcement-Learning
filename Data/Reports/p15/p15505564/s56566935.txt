                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with thoracoscopy s/p left pleurex catheter
 placement  // caheter placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired.
 
 COMPARISON:   Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A moderate left pleural effusion is not significantly changed. Left mid to
 lower lung opacification is also unchanged, likely atelectasis. Assessment of
 the left pleural catheter positioning is limited on the provided radiograph.
 There is no right pleural effusion. The right lung is clear. The heart size is
 difficult to assess but is likely mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contours
 are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Suture chain is seen within the right
 upper lung. There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged moderate left pleural effusion and adjacent presumed atelectasis.
 Assessment of the left-sided pleural catheter positioning is limited. Further
 evaluation of the left lung process and pleural catheter could be performed
 with dedicated PA and lateral radiographs.
