                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Leukocytosis.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged from
 immediate prior exam.  Lung volumes are low with layering bilateral pleural
 effusions and associated bibasilar atelectasis.  Right retrocardiac opacity
 may be due to atelectasis; however, infection cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical circumstance.  A left PICC is unchanged with the tip
 projecting over the mid-to-low SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with layering bilateral pleural effusions and
 bilateral retrocardiac opacities which may be due to atelectasis; however,
 infection cannot be excluded given the appropriate clinical circumstance.
