 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:44 AM
  
  
  
  An endotracheal tube is identified low within the trachea.  For more
  appropriate positioning, the endotracheal tube should be retracted
  approximately 3 cm.  An enteric tube descends the thorax in uncomplicated
  course.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is identified its tip which projects over the
  approximate location of the pain pulmonary artery.  There persist diffuse
  opacification of the left hemithorax with a moderate left pleural effusion. 
  Scattered opacities within the right hemithorax are suggestive of alveolar
  process.
  
  Findings and recommendations d/w house staff Dr. ___ by ___ ___ via
  telephone at ___:11 p on ___ at time of findings.

    EXAMINATION:
 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with liver cirrhosis, with mental status change 
 // ETT placement      ETT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the endotracheal
 tube lies low in the trachea and should be pulled back about 3 cm. 
 Nasogastric tube extends at least to the upper stomach, were crosses the lower
 margin of the image.  Swan-Ganz catheter has its tip in the pulmonary outflow
 tract.
 Little change in the diffuse opacification of the left hemithorax consistent
 with substantial layering effusion and compressive basilar atelectasis. 
 Scattered areas of opacification on the right could reflect an alveolar
 process, with pulmonary vascular congestion probably complicating the
 appearance on both sides.
