  1. ET tube terminates 4.0 cm above the carina.
  
  2. Opacification left hemithorax likely represents a layering pleural effusion
  and underlying consolidation.
  
  3. Prominence the right hilum may be due to low lung volumes, however followup
  imaging is recommended for further assessment.

  1. ET tube terminates 4.0 cm above the carina.
  
  2. Opacification left hemithorax likely represents poor aeration and partial
  collapse of the left lung.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ett eval ett
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single supine view of the chest provided.
 
 The ET tube terminates 4.0 cm above the carina. Lung volumes are low. There is
 a probable large left pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis, potential
 and consolidation. No evidence of pneumothorax.  Increased opacity at the
 right perihilar region and lung base, possibly due to low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   ET tube terminates 4.0 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  Opacification of the left hemithorax likely represents a layering pleural
 effusion and underlying atelectasis/ consolidation.
 
 3. Increased opacity at the right perihilar region and lung base, possibly due
 to low lung volumes, however attention on followup imaging is recommended.
