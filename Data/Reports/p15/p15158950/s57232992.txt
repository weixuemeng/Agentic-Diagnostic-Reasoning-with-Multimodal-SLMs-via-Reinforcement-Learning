 The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The right internal jugular line tip is at
 the level of low SVC.  Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal consolidations
 are redemonstrated, although minimally improved as compared to the prior
 examination.  The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina.  The right PICC line
 is currently pointing upwards cranially and should be considered reposition.
