 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p Bentall/Ao root patch, post pull  //
 ?PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema is improved, but the focal consolidation in the
 left midlung laterally has not. It is not entirely clear whether this is a
 clotting lesion, such as a substantial infection, infarction, or pulmonary
 hemorrhage, or a loculated pleural collection simulating a lung lesion.
 Lateral view might be helpful in distinguishing between the 2, and a CT scan
 would be definitive.
 
 ET tube, right internal jugular line, and upper enteric drainage tube are in
 standard placements. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the main pulmonary artery as
 before. Small bilateral pleural effusion is presumed. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ paged ___ to discuss the findings on
 ___ 12:15  minutes after discovery of the findings, ultimately reported
 by telephone to ___ on ___ 12:20 PM
