                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Epigastric pain radiating to back.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable; evidence of multiple
 mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes are not well appreciated on this
 study, better evaluated on CT.  Cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Partially
 imaged right humeral prosthesis.  Degenerative changes are seen along the
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Prominent mediastinal and
 right hilar lymph nodes are better seen on immediately subsequent chest CT.
