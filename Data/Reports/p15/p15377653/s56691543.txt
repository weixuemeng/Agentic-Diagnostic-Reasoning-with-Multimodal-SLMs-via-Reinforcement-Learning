                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New onset of AFib postoperatively.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___ and CT abdomen from
 ___.
 
 Lung volumes are very low, substantially decreased since the prior study. 
 There is prominence of the mediastinum, potentially related to mediastinal
 lipomatosis, but again different from prior examination and will require
 further assessment with chest CT to exclude the possibility of mediastinal
 mass.  Bibasilar atelectases are substantial.  No pleural effusion is seen.
