                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Persistent cough and right upper lobe rhonchi.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of any prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  The heart is not enlarged.  Effacement of
 the mediastinal contours in the region of the aortopulmonic window can be a
 normal finding in young women.  This study does not constitute a full
 evaluation of the central airways, although there are no findings to suggest
 abnormality.  If symptoms persist and signs point to a tracheobronchial
 abnormality, then CT scanning would be definitive, but I would proceed that
 with an attempt at imaging the tracheobronchial region with oblique views as
 well as conventional radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probably normal chest radiograph.  If symptoms persist, I would
 repeat PA, lateral and oblique chest radiographs in no more than six weeks.
