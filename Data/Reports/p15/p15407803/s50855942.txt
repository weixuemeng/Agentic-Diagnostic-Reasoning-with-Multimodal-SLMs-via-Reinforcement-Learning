 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with picc pulled back by patient  // position of
 picc tip?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Feeding tube, right central venous line are in unchanged positions. The left
 PICC line tip appears to be at the junction of the left brachycephalic vein
 and SVC.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance. Minimal bibasal
 opacities might represent suboptimal inspiratory effort versus tubal
 aspirations, attention on the subsequent study is recommended.
