                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain, dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ___ shunt is again demonstrated in unchanged position, terminating in
 the low SVC. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is accentuated as the result of
 low lung volumes, and appears borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable given the presence of low lung volumes. There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Streaky opacities
 are noted in the lung bases most likely reflective of atelectasis.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with streaky bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.
