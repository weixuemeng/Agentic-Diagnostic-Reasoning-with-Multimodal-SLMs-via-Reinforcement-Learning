                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple medical problems with idiopathic cardiomyopathy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued globular
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with essentially normal pulmonary
 vasculature, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of cardiomyopathy.  The
 basilar regions are substantially clear than on the previous study with only
 minimal residual atelectatic change.
