                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with sepsis.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Previously described increased opacity
 within the bilateral lung bases appear similar to prior and may be related to
 resolving pneumonia.  No new confluent opacity is identified.  There is no
 vascular congestion or overt interstitial edema.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle is stable from prior, may reflect a small unchanged
 effusion.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Possible resolution of prior bibasilar pneumonia.  No new confluent
 opacity to suggest acute infection.
 2.  Unchanged probable small right pleural effusion.
 3.  Unchanged moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly.
