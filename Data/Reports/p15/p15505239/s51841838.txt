                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fatigue, leukocytosis.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Best seen on the lateral exam is increased
 consolidation in the retrocardiac region, not definitively seen but
 potentially localizing to the right on the frontal.  Given clinical setting,
 this would be suspicious for pneumonia.  There is no large effusion.  Cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but stable in configuration.  Degenerative changes seen
 at shoulders bilaterally as well as hypertrophic changes in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Region of consolidation better seen on the lateral.  In the
 proper clinical setting, this would be compatible with pneumonia.  Recommend
 repeat after treatment to document resolution.
