                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female, status post kidney transplant, now short of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate improved pulmonary
 vascular congestion since previous imaging.  The lateral view demonstrates a
 spine sign which suggests a retrocardiac opacity which is worrisome for
 pneumonia.  There are mild bibasilar atelectatic changes.  It is not clear on
 this exam if there are pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax
 visualized.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved pulmonary vascular congestion.  New retrocardiac opacity
 worrisome for pneumonia.
