 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  follow up..
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube now
 projects 5.8 cm above the carina with its tip.  The position of a left PICC
 line and of the nasogastric tube are constant.
 
 Lung volumes are unchanged.  Blunting of the right costophrenic sinus suggests
 the presence of a small pleural effusion.  Also is a left basal retrocardiac
 atelectasis that is overall unchanged in an area of increased parenchymal
 opacity in the left basolateral lung.  The changes might be infectious in
 origin and are constant since the previous examination.
 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
 An abdominal drain projects over the right upper quadrant.  No pneumothorax.
