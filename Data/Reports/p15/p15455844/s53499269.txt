                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 3:16 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with trach, repeated aspiration, necrotizing
 pneumonia, question assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 11:16.
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 3:16 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left subclavian PICC line and tracheostomy tube remain in satisfactory
 position.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contour is difficult to assess
 given patient rotation on the current examination.  There continues to be
 bilateral patchy airspace opacities with a more confluent opacity at the left
 base, which may reflect multifocal pneumonia.  An element of superimposed
 edema cannot be entirely excluded as the pulmonary vasculature appears
 somewhat indistinct.  There is a layering left effusion and a smaller right
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.
