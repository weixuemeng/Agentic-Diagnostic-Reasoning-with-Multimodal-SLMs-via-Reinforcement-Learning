 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pulmonary edema or pneumonia in a patient with
 worsening tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the most recent comparison, there is an increase in

 bilateral lower lobe and left mid lung atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.
 The appearance of the mediastinum and heart are unchanged.  A right internal
 jugular central venous catheter terminates in the lower SVC.  The previously
 seen malpositioned left PICC has been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  Persistent bilateral atelectasis.
