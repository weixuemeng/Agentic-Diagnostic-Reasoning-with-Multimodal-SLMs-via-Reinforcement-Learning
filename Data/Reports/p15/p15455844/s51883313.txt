                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Low-grade fever and tachycardia.
 
 There is a radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A left-sided PICC terminates at the
 upper SVC.  The heart size is top normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours
 are within normal limits.  The lung volumes are low, resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding.  There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or
 pleural effusion.  Bibasilar linear opacities are most compatible with
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
