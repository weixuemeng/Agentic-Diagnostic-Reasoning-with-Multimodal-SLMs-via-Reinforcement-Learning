  New tracheostomy overlies the upper trachea.  Left PICC terminates in mid-low
  SVC.  Increased opacification of left hemithorax with slight increased in
  heterogeneous right opacities are compatible with worsening pulmonary edema
  with increased pleural effusions.  It would be difficult to exclude underlying
  focal consolidation.  - ___ d/w Dr. ___ ___ phone on ___ at ___

 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube has been exchanged for a tracheostomy tube, which
 terminates within the trachea about 3 cm above the carina.  Moderate to large
 left pleural effusion has apparently increased in size since the recent study,
 although positional differences limit comparison.  Small to moderate right
 pleural effusion with intrafissural component appears unchanged, however. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Slight worsening of
 multifocal heterogeneous lung opacities, likely representing multifocal
 infection considering the appearance on prior CT of ___. 
 Co-existing pulmonary edema is also possible.
