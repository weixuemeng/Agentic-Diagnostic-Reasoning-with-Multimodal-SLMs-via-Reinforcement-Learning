                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of dyspnea.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable supine chest radiograph was provided.  Lung volumes are low. 
 There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and the hila compatible with
 pulmonary congestion.  There are bibasilar consolidations, likely a
 combination of atelectasis and pneumonia.  There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is notable for a tortuous aorta. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Pulmonary congestion.
 
 2. Bibasilar consolidations, likely atelectasis and pneumonia.
 
 3. Likely small bilateral pleural effusions.
