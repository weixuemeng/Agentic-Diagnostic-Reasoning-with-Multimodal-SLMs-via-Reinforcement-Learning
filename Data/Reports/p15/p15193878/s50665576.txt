                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain in the setting of known coronary
 artery disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, performed at___ and chest CT from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Increased interstitial
 markings seen throughout the lungs are similar compared to prior, and are due
 to likely combination of calcified pleural plaques and underlying interstitial
 abnormality.  There is no new region of consolidation nor effusion.  Cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but stable.  Left chest wall dual-lead pacing device is
 again seen.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse increased interstitial markings likely due to
 interstitial changes and pleural plaques in the setting of prior asbestos
 exposure.  No definite superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.
