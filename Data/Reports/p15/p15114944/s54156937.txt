 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices have been removed.  The alignment of the sternal wires is constant. 
 The pleural effusions that pre-existed have minimally increased.  Also
 increased is a left lower lobe atelectasis.  The effusions are better
 appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  No other relevant
 changes, in particular no evidence of edema or pneumonia.
