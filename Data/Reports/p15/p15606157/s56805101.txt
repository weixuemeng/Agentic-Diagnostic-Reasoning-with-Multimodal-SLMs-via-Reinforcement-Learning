                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // ? acute cardipulm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT from ___ chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pleural based opacity along the mid right lateral chest corresponds to that
 seen on recent prior PET-CT.  There is blunting of the posterior right
 costophrenic angle consistent with small right pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis, underlying pleural lesion better assessed on CT.  Prominence of
 the right hilum is similar to prior chest CT.  No definite new focal
 consolidation.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lateral mid chest pleural based opacity corresponds to that seen on
 recent prior PET-CT.  Small right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis,
 underlying pleural lesion better assessed on CT.
