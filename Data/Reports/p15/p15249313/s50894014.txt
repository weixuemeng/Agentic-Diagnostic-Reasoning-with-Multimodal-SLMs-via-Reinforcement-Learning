  No evidence of acute process.  Asymmetric nodule focus projecting over the
  right lung, nipple versus nodule; suggest PA view with nipple markers when
  appropriate.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Right anterior rib pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is a nodular focus of 8 mm in diameter
 projecting over the right mid lung as well as the anterior course of the right
 fifth rib, suggestive of a nipple shadow.  The appearance is asymmetric but
 there is possibly also a vague nipple shadow on the left.  Otherwise, the lung
 fields appear clear.  There are no definite pleural effusions, but blunting of
 the right posterior costophrenic sulcus makes it difficult to exclude a tiny
 effusion.  Aside from mild degenerative changes along the thoracic spine, bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.
 2.  Nodular focus projecting over the right lung suggesting a nipple shadow,
 but confirmation with an additional PA view with nipple markers is suggested
 when clinically appropriate.
