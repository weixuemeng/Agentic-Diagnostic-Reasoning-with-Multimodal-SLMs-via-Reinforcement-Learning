                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient is status post fall with left-sided rib pain and
 tenderness.  Evaluate for fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Multiple rounded opacities
 in the right and left hila are compatible with calcified lymph nodes.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Multiple rounded opacities in the right
 and left hila are compatible with calcified lymph nodes.
 
 2.  No rib fractures are identified.  However, this study has suboptimal
 sensitivity for the detection of rib fractures and if there is further
 clinical concern, dedicated right rib views should be obtained.
