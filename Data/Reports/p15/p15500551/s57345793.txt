                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain in a patient with a history of PE and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___,
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate mildly increased
 opacity in the right lower lung, as seen on recent chest radiograph. Opacities
 previously seen in the left lower lung and upper lobe are not as prominent on
 today's exam.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette remains normal. The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent but improved right base opacity, consistent with resolving
 pneumonia. Left base and upper lobe opacities are no longer appreciated on
 today's exam.
