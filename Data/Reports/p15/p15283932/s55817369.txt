                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain, dyspnea  // acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube
 terminating 2.6 cm from the carina, an enteric tube terminating in the
 stomach, and median sternotomy wires, and the most inferior of which is
 fractured.  The heart is severely enlarged.  There is moderate to severe
 pulmonary edema.  No definite focal consolidation is visualized.  There are
 probable trace bilateral pleural effusions. The left costophrenic angle is not
 included on this image.  No appreciable pneumothorax is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate to severe pulmonary edema and severe cardiomegaly.
 2. Endotracheal tube is slightly low, terminating 2.6 cm from the carina. 
 This can be pulled back 1 cm for optimal positioning.
 3. Probable bilateral trace pleural effusions.
