                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with falls, question rib fracture or
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the latest from ___.
 
 ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 
 There are with bilateral interstitial opacities, with atelectasis or scarring
 at the right base, unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal or
 slightly enlarged.  The left hilum is prominent.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected. There are fractured sternal wires  superiorly --
 these appear diffrent compared with ___ CXR, which also showed fractured
 wires -- ? due to differences in positioning (most likely), change in wire
 fragment position, or  interval wire fracture -- attention to this area on
 follow-up films is recommended. The adjoining mediastinal contour is
 unchanged.
 
 Assessment of rib fxs is limited on this lung-technique films. Focal opacity
 along right inferior chest wall is noted, but may relate to rib fxs and
 hematoma seen on the ___ CT. No displaced rib fracture is identified. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Mild unchanged pulmonary edema. 
 
 2) No displaced rib fracture detected. Opacity adjacent to right inferior
 chest wall.  If this corresponds to a site of focal tenderness, it could
 indicate an acute fracture, but it also corresponds to a prior site of rib
 fracture and hematoma and may very well be an old injury.  
 
 3) Change in configuration of fractured superior sternal wires. Please see
 comment above.
