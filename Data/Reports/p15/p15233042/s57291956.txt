                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with diarrhea but spiked a fever  // r/o PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 155
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 No definite focal infiltrate is identified. Compared to the prior film, there
 is slight increase in the degree of vascular engorgement, consistent with mild
 superimposed CHF. No frank consolidation or gross effusion. Again seen is
 background COPD and cardiomegaly, with sternotomy wires, including fractured
 sternotomy wires superiorly, similar to the prior study. The right IJ central
 line is no longer visualized. Partial image right humeral hardware noted.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable slight increase in CHF findings. No definite superimposed infiltrate.
 The possibility of an early occult infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.
