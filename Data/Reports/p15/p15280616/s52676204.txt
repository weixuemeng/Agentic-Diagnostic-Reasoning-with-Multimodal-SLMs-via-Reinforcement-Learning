 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly. Pacer leads follow their expected course to
 the right atrium and ventricle.  The consolidation in the right lower lobe has
 mildly improved, consistent with resolving pneumonia.  No new focal
 consolidation is seen.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is mildly improved.  The
 right hilum is enlarged, for which attention on follow-up studies is
 recommended.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Thoracic compression fracture is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mildly improved right lower lobe consolidation, consistent with resolving
 pneumonia.  Mildly improved pulmonary vascular congestion.
