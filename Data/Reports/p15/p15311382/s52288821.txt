                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:  A right PICC terminates in the mid-to-low SVC.  It is best
 evaluated on the lateral view, where it terminates 3 cm inferior to the
 carina.
 
 Results regarding the PICC line were discussed with ___ of the IV team at
 1:30 p.m. on ___ via telephone by Dr. ___ at the time the findings were
 discovered.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with ALL on chemotherapy, now presenting with
 neutropenic fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There are subtle linear opacities
 within the right lung base which likely project over the spine on the lateral
 view, increased since most recent prior examination from ___
 though similar to PA and lateral chest radiograph from ___. 
 Findings may reflect normal overlapping vascular structures or atelectasis,
 though early pneumonia is also possible, particularly given the history of
 neutropenic fever.  Recommend followup radiographs to assess for interval
 change or improvement.  The remainder of the lungs are clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema or pleural effusions are identified. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle linear opacities in the right lower lobe which may reflect
 normal overlapping vessels or atelectasis.  However, in this patient with
 neutropenic fever, early developing pneumonia remains a consideration.  Close
 interval followup radiograph is recommended.
