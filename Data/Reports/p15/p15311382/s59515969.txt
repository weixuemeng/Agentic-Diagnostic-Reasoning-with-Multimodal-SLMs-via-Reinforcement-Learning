 HISTORY:  Fever and neutropenia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change.  As before, a
 left-sided PICC line is present, tip over distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.   The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No CHF,
 focal infiltrate, or effusion is identified.
