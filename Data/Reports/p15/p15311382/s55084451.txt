                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Possible bowel perforation and instability, now intubated due to
 poor oxygenation.  Evaluate endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, abdominal radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. 
 Lung volumes are extremely low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  The
 endotracheal tube projects 5 mm above the carina directed towards the right
 main stem bronchus with the chin up, putting the patient at risk for bronchial
 intubation.  The upper enteric tube ends in the stomach.  The right subclavian
 line projects over the right atrium.
 
 Atelectasis in the right upper and left lower lobes are likely the result of
 the low endotracheal tube.  There is no large effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Gaseous distention of bowel is better assessed on the concurrent abdominal
 radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube projects 5 mm above the carina and should be
 retracted to avoid bronchial intubation.  
 
 The findings were discovered at 9:43 a.m. and discussed with Dr. ___
 by phone at 9:45 a.m. on ___.
