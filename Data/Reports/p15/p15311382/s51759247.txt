                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON EXAM:  PA and lateral chest x-ray ___.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with ALL, currently on chemo, now with worsening
 shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears larger on the study as compared to last.  This is
 likely due to the AP lordotic-like projection of this current film as well as
 slightly lower lung volumes.  Cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable.  The
 lungs are clear.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Right PICC line remains in good position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia.
