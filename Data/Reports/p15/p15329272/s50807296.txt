                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia, SOB  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  Comparison to old studies would be helpful does to assess
 for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart is normal size and cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications are present in the aortic arch and
 along the descending thoracic aorta.  Symmetrically expanded lungs are
 hyperinflated suggestive of underlying emphysema.  Upper lobe opacities with
 volume loss and parenchymal distortion could represent post inflammatory
 changes or an acute infectious process including TB.  Clinical correlation is
 advised. No pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral upper lobe opacities with volume loss and parenchymal distortion.   
 Comparison to remote studies would be helpful to assess for chronicity.  Acute
 infection including TB should also be considered.
