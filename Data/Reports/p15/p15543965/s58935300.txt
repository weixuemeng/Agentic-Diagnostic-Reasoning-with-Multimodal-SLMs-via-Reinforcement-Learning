                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Crohn's and CMV viremia  // Please eval for
 pleural effusions or interstitial abnormalities
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a new, small, right-sided pleural effusion, and likely a trace
 left-sided effusion.  Heart size and pulmonary vascularity remain within
 normal limits.  The diffuse lower lung predominant septal thickening is
 present as well as poorly defined lower lung peribronchiolar opacities
 centrally in the infrahilar areas appear
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval development of a small right-sided pleural effusion, and a trace
 left-sided effusion.
 2. The new bilateral lower lobe predominant interstitial abnormalities, which
 most likely represent an atypical pneumonia in the absence of ancillary
 findings of fluid overload.
