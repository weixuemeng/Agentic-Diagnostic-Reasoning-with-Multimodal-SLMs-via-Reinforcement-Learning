                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with liver disease, report of effusion from OSH
 previously  // ? effusion or other acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A large right pleural effusion is present with compressive right basilar
 atelectasis.  There is mild shift of the mediastinal structures towards the
 left.  Heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of the large
 pleural effusion.  No pulmonary vascular engorgement is present.  Patchy
 opacity in the left lung base may reflect atelectasis, though infection is not
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.  No left-sided pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Large right pleural effusion with compressive right basilar atelectasis.
 2. Patchy opacity in the left lung base may reflect atelectasis, but infection
 is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
