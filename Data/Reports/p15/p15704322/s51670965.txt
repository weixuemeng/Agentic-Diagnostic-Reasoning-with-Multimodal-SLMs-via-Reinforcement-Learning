                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position
 approximately 4.0 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip extending
 beneath the diaphragm, off film.
 
 Compared with ___ at 3:53 a.m., increased retrocardiac density with left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and probable small left effusion is
 again seen, slightly progressed compared with the earlier film.  The right
 lung remains grossly clear except for minimal atelectasis and minimal blunting
 in the right costophrenic angle.  
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent
 with CHF.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, with cardiomegaly and
 prominent pulmonary arteries.  Deformity of some posterior left upper chest
 ribs suggests prior surgery or trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes as described.
 2.  Upper zone redistribution and interstitial edema.
 3.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation slightly progressed.
