                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with subdural hematoma status post fall. 
 Assess for acute injury.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  The heart is of
 normal size.  An endotracheal tube terminates in the proximal right main stem
 bronchus.  The left lower lobe is collapsed, likely related to endotracheal
 tube position.  There is small atelectasis of the right lower lobe.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions are seen.  No pneumothorax.  NG tube terminates below the
 diaphragm.  Calcified densities overlying the left upper quadrant may
 represent staghorn calculi.  Irregularity of the left chest wall osseous
 structures may represent prior trauma or surgery.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminating in proximal right main stem bronchus with
 left lower lobe collapse.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Calcified densities overlying the left upper quadrant may represent
 staghorn calculi.
