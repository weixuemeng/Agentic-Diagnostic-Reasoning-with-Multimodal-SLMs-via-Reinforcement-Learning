                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and palpitations.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Widening of the superior mediastinum is noted,
 and could reflect possible mediastinal lipomatosis.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 not engorged.  Assessment of the lung parenchyma is somewhat limited due to
 suboptimal penetration.  There is probable mild bibasilar atelectasis, but no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Widened mediastinum may be secondary to mediastinal lipomatosis.  Consider
 comparison with prior radiographs or chest CT for further assessment if there
 is concern for mediastinal abnormality.
