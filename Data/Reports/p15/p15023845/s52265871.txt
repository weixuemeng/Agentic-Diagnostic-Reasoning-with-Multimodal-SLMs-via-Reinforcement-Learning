 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:35 AM
  
  
  
  In comparison to chest radiograph from ___, there has been interval
  placement of the left chest cardiac device with associated dual leads in
  grossly appropriate location projecting over the right atrium and ventricle. 
  There are low lung volumes and a poor inspiratory effort.  There is a tortuous
  and calcified thoracic aorta, as on prior.  The cardiomediastinal silhouettes
  are stable, allowing for differences in technique and inspiratory effort. 
  There is no focal lung consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  Blunting of
  the left lateral CP angle is noted, difficult to exclude a trace left pleural
  effusion.
