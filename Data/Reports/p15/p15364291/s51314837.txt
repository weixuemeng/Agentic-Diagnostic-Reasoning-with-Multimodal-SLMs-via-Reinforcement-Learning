                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with left pneumothorax.
 
 As compared to the prior study obtained the same-day earlier, current
 examination demonstrates slight interval decrease in the pneumothorax,
 currently restricted to the apex.  There is also slight improvement in bibasal
 areas of atelectasis and increase in the lung volumes.  Small amount of
 subcutaneous air is re-demonstrated.
