 As compared to the previous radiograph, the left chest tube was removed.  The
 apical portion of the pre-existing pneumothorax is unchanged.  However, along
 the lateral chest wall, the pneumothorax appears to have slightly increased in
 extent.  The volume of the left hemi thorax is smaller than before and the
 extent of a left pleural effusion has slightly increased.  No change in
 appearance of the right lung.
