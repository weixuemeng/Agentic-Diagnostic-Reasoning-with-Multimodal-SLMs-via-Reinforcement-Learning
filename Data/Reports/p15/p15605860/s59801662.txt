  1. Large diaphragmatic hernia with air-filled loop of bowel. 2. Moderate left
  pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis. 3. Heterogeneous left upper
  lobe opacity is worrisome for pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. Clinical
  correlation is recommended. 4. Enteric feeding tube with tip in stomach and
  side-port at the level of the diaphragm.  Consider advancing 5-10 cm for
  better positioning

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.  With that
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with bowel obstruction, s/p NG tube placement.  Assess NG
 tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:   CT chest ___, outside CT abdomen/ pelvis ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An enteric feeding tube is seen coursing midline with tip in stomach and side
 ports at the level of the diaphragm.
 
 The right lung is clear.  A diaphragmatic hernia is again seen with air-filled
 loop of bowel.  A moderate pleural effusion is present with associated
 compressive atelectasis as well as a left upper lobe heterogeneous opacity. 
 Limited evaluation of heart due to overlying parenchymal abnormality. 
 Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Large diaphragmatic hernia with air-filled loop of bowel.
 2.  Moderate left pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis.
 3.  Heterogeneous left upper lobe opacity is probably due to atelectasis but
 coexisting aspiration or infectious pneumonia is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting
 4.  Enteric feeding tube with tip in stomach and side-port at the level of the
 diaphragm.  Consider advancing 5-10 cm for better positioning.
