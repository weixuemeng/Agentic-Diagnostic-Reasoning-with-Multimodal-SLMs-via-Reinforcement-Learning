                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided chest pain, cough, rule out infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  
 
 A right subclavian PICC line is present.  The tip is not optimally visualized.
 It appears to lie in the region of the SVC/RA junction, possibly slightly
 distal to it. 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is calcified and unfolded. 
 There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.  There is patchy opacity
 at both lung bases, greater on the left, and minimal blunting of both lateral
 and both posterior costophrenic angles,consistent with small effusions. Mild
 prominence of both hila is noted, unchanged.  
 
 There is a rounded opacity measuring ___.7 mm in the right upper zone,
 projecting along the inferior edge of the right first anterior rib.  This is
 new compared with ___, but similar to ___.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  COPD.
 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly.  Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 3.  Patchy opacity left lower lobe.  The possibility of an infectious
 infiltrate cannot be excluded.  Small bilateral effusions present.
 
 4.  Prominent bilateral hila, grossly stable over multiple prior films and
 similar to ___.  Possibility of lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded.
 Clinical correlation is requested. 
 
 5.  Small rounded nodular opacity right upper zone.  Although this could
 represent an artifact due to overlap of vascular and osseous shadows or
 possibily callus related ___ rib fracture, the possibility of a pulmonary
 nodule is difficult to exclude on these images.  Further assessment with CT
 should be considered.
 
 Findings in item 4 and 5 were submitted to the clinical results dashboard and
 discussed with Dr. ___ at approximately 5:26 pm on the day of the exam.
