 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Esophageal balloon, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 3:06 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, an esophageal lumen appears
 to have inserted.  The balloon, however, is not clearly visible on the
 radiograph.  No pneumothorax or other changes.  The pre-existing nasogastric
 tube and the endotracheal tube are in unchanged position.
