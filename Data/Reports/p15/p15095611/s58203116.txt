                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  On ventilator with decreased O2 sats.  Evaluate tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube ends 3 cm above the level of the carina.  The NG tube
 passes below the level of the diaphragm and likely out of the field of view
 inferiorly.  Lung volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and
 accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is marked retrocardiac
 atelectasis.  The heart is moderately enlarged allowing for AP technique. 
 There is a left apical cap and moderate left pleural effusion.  There is no
 definite right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left apical cap with moderate left pleural effusion are concerning for
 aortic pathology.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
 
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Retrocardiac atelectasis.
 
 Pertinent findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
 at 8:15 a.m. on the day of the study.
