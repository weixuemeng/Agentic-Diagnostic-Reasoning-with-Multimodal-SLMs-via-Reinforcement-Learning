 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with past medical history of COPD and
 schizoaffective disorder, depression, and hypertension, who was found down
 with albuterol inhaler at side.  Now with respiratory failure and shock. 
 Assess for position of NG tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recently performed 11 hours prior.
 
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There now are two NG tubes which appear to
 both end in the stomach, although the tips are not seen.  The endotracheal
 tube ends approximately 2.3 cm above the carina with the chin pointing
 downwards.  Lung volumes remain low.  Retrocardiac opacity persists.  Mild
 vascular congestion is stable.
