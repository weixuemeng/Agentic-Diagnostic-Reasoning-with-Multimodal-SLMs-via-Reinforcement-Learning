                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated and ventilated with cuff leak improving after advancing
 the tube.  Assess endotracheal tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier the same morning.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is in appropriate position 4.7 cm above the
 carina.  Low lung volumes are noted.  Nasogastric tube is not well assessed on
 the current study, though concurrently obtained abdominal radiograph
 demonstrates that it terminates in the proximal stomach.  Intervally developed
 right basal opacity is likely atelectasis.  The heart is mildly enlarged with
 normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Left subclavian catheter terminates in
 the upper SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory position of monitoring and support devices with
 increaed right basal atelectasis.
