                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine chest view was read in comparison with
 prior chest radiograph from ___ acquired six hours apart.
 
 Patient has received a new left subclavian line which ends approximately at
 the level of the mid SVC.  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6 cm
 above the carina.  A single orogastric tube is present, and its course can be
 traced only till the level of the mid thorax, but beyond that visibility was
 limited due to radiographic technical factors.  Superior mediastinum appears
 mildly widened but some of it can be at least attributed to the supine
 position.  Bilateral lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged. 
 Hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no demonstrable pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left subclavian line ends at mid SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mild widening of the superior mediastinum may be an
 exaggeration from a supine view. The lower lung atelectasis is unchanged.
