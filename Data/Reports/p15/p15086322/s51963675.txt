 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  A left
 tunneled dialysis catheter ends within the low SVC.  Lung volumes are slightly
 low, with streaky left lower lobe opacities, consistent with subsegmental
 atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation.  Mild cardiomegaly is not
 significantly changed compared to the radiographs from ___,
 allowing for differences in lung volumes.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly, not significantly changed.
