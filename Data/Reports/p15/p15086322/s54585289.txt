                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New O2 requirement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  There is atelectasis at the left base.  Compared
 with ___ at 23:55 p.m., the degree of lung expansion is decreased.  The
 left base atelectasis is, however, similar.  No new infiltrate is identified. 
 Again noted is a left IJ catheter with tip over distal SVC.  No pneumothorax
 is detected.  No CHF.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probable atelectasis left base, possibly with trace pleural fluid.  This is
 essentially unchanged compared with ___.  If there is high concern for a
 pneumonic infiltrate in this location, then a lateral view may help for
 further assessment.
