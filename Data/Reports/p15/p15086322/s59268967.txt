                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs of the chest from ___ and more
 recent CT from that same day of the abdomen and pelvis (not fetched at this
 time).
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dual-lumen dialysis catheter terminating in the lower
 superior vena cava.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is again moderate cardiomegaly.  The aortic arch is partly
 calcified.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is similar
 patchy opacification of the left cardiophrenic angle and projecting over the
 posterior lower lobes on the lateral view, but there is no evidence for acute
 superimposed opacification.  Left basilar and posterior opacities are probably
 due to minor atelectasis or scarring.  The osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest with no evidence of acute disease.
