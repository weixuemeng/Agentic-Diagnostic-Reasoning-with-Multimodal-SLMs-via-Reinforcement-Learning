                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and fevers.  Evaluation for acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate a rounded left
 perihilar opacity, which is new since the prior study, and is suspicious for
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  However, since it is round and
 mass-like, a mass lesion is not excluded.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear with
 no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is otherwise normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left perihilar opacity is unusual but could be seen with round
 pneumonia in the appropriate setting; however, short-term follow-up
 radiographs are recommended within four weeks to ensure resolution and exclude
 a mass lesion.  
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
 at 8:29 p.m., five minutes after discovery.
