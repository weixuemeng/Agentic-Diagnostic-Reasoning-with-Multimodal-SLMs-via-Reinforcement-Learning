                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB  // evidence of fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart is top normal size and mediastinal silhouette is stable.  Dense
 calcifications are present along the aortic arch and throughout the descending
 thoracic aorta.  Bilateral perihilar opacities with peribronchial cuffing and
 thickening of the minor fissure and areas of ground-glass opacification in the
 right upper and lower lung likely represent mild asymmetric pulmonary
 interstitial edema.  Hazy opacification in the right upper lung infectious in
 etiology or represent edema related to mitral regurgitation.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are present.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval development of perihilar and asymmetric opacification of the right
 hemithorax may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema or atypical infection.  In
 the setting of edema, involvement of the right upper lobe can represent mitral
 regurgitation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  An echocardiogram is recommended to look for presence of
 mitral regurgitation if not performed already.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 on the ___ ___ at 9:10 AM, 10 minutes after discovery of the
