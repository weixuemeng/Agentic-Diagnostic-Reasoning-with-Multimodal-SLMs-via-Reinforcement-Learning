 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cerebral palsy c/b quadriplegia and
 chronic respiratory failure (s/p trach/PEG), recently treated for MSSA VAP
 (inpatient ___) with new onset fever/leukocytosis with GNR bacteremia
 and UTI. Episodes of desats overnight.  // ? interval change, ? pulmonary
 edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, pulmonary edema has
 slightly decreased in severity.  Asymmetrical distribution of residual
 opacities but could reflect asymmetrical edema or superimposed pneumonia in
 the left lung.  Bilateral pleural effusions are a persistent finding, and note
 is made of marked overdistension of the tracheostomy tube cuff.
