                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with trach, fevers, increased purulent sputum
 c/f infection  // Evaluation for worsening edema v. infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, lung volumes remain low
 and exaggerate heart size, which is likely normal.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions persist.  Right basilar opacity has worsened, which likely
 represents atelectasis, though aspiration or infection should be considered in
 the appropriate clinical context.  Left basilar opacity have improved.  No new
 focal consolidation.  Central vascular congestion has resolved.  No pulmonary
 edema.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Right Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Left-sided IJ
 central venous catheter terminates in the lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Worsening right basilar opacity, which could represent atelectasis, though
 aspiration or infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical
 context.  No new focal consolidation.
 2. Improved left basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.
 3. Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.
 4. Resolved central vascular congestion.  No pulmonary edema.
