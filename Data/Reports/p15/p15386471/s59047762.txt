                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tracheostomy, advanced 2 mm to prevent air
 leak  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 04:45
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.  Because of differences in positioning, it is difficult
 to directly compare the position of the tracheostomy tube on the 2
 examinations.
  The distance between the tip of the tube at the carina measures ___.3 mm on
 the current exam, compared with 30.6 mm on the exam obtained earlier today.
 The balloon about the tracheostomy tube appears roughly similar in position.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low.  Again seen is considerable opacification in the
 right lung and left lower lobe collapse and consolidation with air
 bronchograms as well as a right pleural effusion.  The possibility of a small
 left effusion cannot be excluded.
 
 Indwelling right subclavian central line tip lies near the SVC/RA junction,
 similar to prior. Left IJ central line tip overlies the mid SVC. There are
 also similar to prior.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube tip lies approximately 1.5 cm more distal on the current examination.
 
 Extensive airspace opacity in the right lung again seen, most pronounced at
 the base.  Left lower lobe consolidation also again seen.  Small to moderate
 layering right effusion.
 
 Other lines and tubes as described
