 evolution of consolidation      eval for evolution of consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 01:06
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 07:46 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube, right subclavian Port-A-Cath and left internal jugular
 central line are unchanged in position.  The heart remains enlarged which may
 reflect cardiomegaly although pericardial effusion should also be considered. 
 There are layering pleural effusions, right greater than left.  Bibasilar
 opacities are again seen likely reflecting lobar atelectasis, although
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Overall, however, aeration in the right lung
 has improved.  Low lung volumes with crowding of the vasculature and no overt
 pulmonary edema.  Stable thoracolumbar curvature.  Gastrostomy tube is in
 place.
