                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with CF, vent dependent with minimal air leak.  //
 evaluate for tracheostomy placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC.  A left central venous
 catheter tip terminates in the upper SVC.  Tracheostomy tube tip terminates
 approximately 3.3 cm from the carina.  Lung volumes remain low. Heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  There is retrocardiac opacity which could reflect
 atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen on this supine exam.  Mild S-shaped scoliosis is re-
 demonstrated within the thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Tracheostomy tube tip is in standard position.
 2. Persistent left basilar opacity which may reflect atelectasis but infection
 is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
