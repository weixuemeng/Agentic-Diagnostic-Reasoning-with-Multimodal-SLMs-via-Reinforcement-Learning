                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes
 are low, exaggerating heart size and bronchovascular markings.  Cardiomegaly
 is moderate and the left atrium is enlarged, similar to prior.  Increased
 interstitial markings are compatible with mild pulmonary edema.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is slight leftward deviation of the trachea,
 compatible with thyroid gland enlargement.  The osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with moderate cardiomegaly.
