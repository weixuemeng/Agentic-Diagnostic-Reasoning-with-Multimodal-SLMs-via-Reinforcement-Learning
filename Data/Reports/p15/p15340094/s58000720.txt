 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___. Targeted review of abdominal ct
 from ___. Chest CT from ___ is off line and not immediately
 available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is probable background hyperinflation, consistent with COPD.
 
 The heart size is at the upper limits of normal. The aorta is calcified
 minimally unfolded. There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.
 
 There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle, with minimal patchy density
 there, which appears to represent a long-standing finding and is seen on the
 radiograph from ___. There appears to be an adjacent skin fold on
 today's examination.
 
 There is minimal density overlying the apex of the heart --? confluence of
 shadows from the bone, heart and vessels. This was not seen on the ___ chest x-ray. There is minimal atelectasis at the left lung base, which is
 also slightly more pronounced .
 No focal consolidation or effusion is identified.

 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Probable background COPD.
 2. Doubt acute pulmonary process.
 3. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle again noted.
 4. Focal density at the left heart apex most likely represents confluence of
 vascular and osseous shadows. Recommend followup radiograph in ___ months to
 document clearing.
