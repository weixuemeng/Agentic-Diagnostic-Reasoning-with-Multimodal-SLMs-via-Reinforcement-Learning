                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p MVA injury, s/p Humerus fx repair  //
 elevated hemidiaphragm? any lung pathology from MVA?      elevated
 hemidiaphragm? any lung pathology from MVA?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. The tip of the endotracheal tube measures approximately 5
 cm above the carina. Low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of
 the heart as well as the mediastinum. Some of the mediastinal widening may
 reflect the size of the patient.  There is increased opacification on the
 right marginated by the minor fissure. This could represent posttraumatic
 pulmonary hemorrhage or aspiration or infectious process.  There is some
 engorgement of pulmonary vessels that could reflect over-hydration. 
 Retrocardiac opacification most likely is an indication of volume loss in left
 lower lobe. No evidence of pneumothorax.
 Although the widening of the mediastinum to be normal in this patient, if
 there is any clinical sign of mediastinal hemorrhage, CT would be mandatory.
