                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with legionella PNA, R IJ may be slightly pulled
 out.  // IJ placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 05:42, outside facility chest
 CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular catheter terminates at the mid SVC, little changed from
 the prior radiograph on ___.  Tip of the endotracheal tube is
 normal visualize, but terminates around the mid thoracic trachea.  Sternal
 wires are intact.  Enteric tube is partially visualized.
 
 Heterogeneous areas of right lung opacification, more pronounced at the lung
 base, consistent with known pneumonia.  Left retrocardiac opacity is new from
 the prior chest CT on ___, and likely represents atelectasis.  Left
 upper lung is clear. Small layering pleural effusions are noted bilaterally. 
 No pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right IJ catheter terminates in the mid SVC, little changed from the prior
 study.
 2. Heterogeneous areas of basilar predominant right lung consolidation,
 consistent with known pneumonia.
 3. Small bilateral layering pleural effusions.
