                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after CABG and
 postoperative pneumothorax.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  The previously seen left apical
 pneumothorax appears to be increased despite the presence of the chest tube
 that was recently clamped.  Small bilateral pleural effusion is noted.
