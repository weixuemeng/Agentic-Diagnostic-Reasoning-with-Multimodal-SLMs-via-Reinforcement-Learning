  Compared with plain films of the chest dated ___
  
  Overlying wires somewhat limits interpretation.  The mediastinal contour is
  prominent in comparison to the prior examination.  This is likely due to
  difference in technique, though if there is suspicion for new mediastinal
  hematoma or other pathology, CT scan can be obtained for further evaluation. 
  Lung volumes are very low.  No definite focal consolidation is identified.  A
  large amount of air distends the stomach.
