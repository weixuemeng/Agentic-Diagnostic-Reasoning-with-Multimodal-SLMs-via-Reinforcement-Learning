 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough for 2 months  // lesions?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhoutte is moderate to severely enlarged.  The mediastinum is
 normal in width and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  No right lung
 opacity is seen.  The retrocardiac portion of the left lung may be opacified,
 however, this area is not well seen due to enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in the absence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion is concerning for cardiomyopathy or a
 pericardial effusion.  The retrocardiac lung parenchyma is poorly seen, and
 retrocardiac opacity could represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  ___ discussed with ___ at ___ ___.
