                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with new R IJ  // eval for line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of a right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter
 terminating at the cavoatrial junction. A slightly widened distance between
 the right IJ line and the trachea is noted. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 Lung volumes are mildly decreased. There is bibasilar atelectasis and minimal
 interstitial pulmonary edema. There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax. Stable appearance of a TAVR.  Calcifications are
 noted within the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Right IJ catheter terminating at the CA junction.
 2. Stable, mild cardiomegaly and mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 3. Slight widening of the distance between the right IJ line and trachea.
 Findings may be secondary to goiter, and correlation with physical examination
 is recommended.
