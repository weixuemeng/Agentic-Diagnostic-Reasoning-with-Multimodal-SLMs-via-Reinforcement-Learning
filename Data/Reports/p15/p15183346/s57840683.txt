 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Aorta is mildly tortuous
 and calcified without change.  Lungs are grossly clear except for minimal
 linear scar or atelectasis in the left base.  No pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or acute skeletal abnormality.

 skeletal etiology is considered clinically, dedicated skeletal radiographs may
 be helpful for more complete assessment.
