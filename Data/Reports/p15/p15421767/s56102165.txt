                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pancreatic cancer, dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears mildly enlarged. The aorta is unfolded.  Widening of the right
 paratracheal stripe is unchanged, and could suggest underlying lymphadenopathy
 or mediastinal fat. The hilar contours are unchanged. The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal. There is minimal atelectasis at the lung bases without
 focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly
 identified. Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again noted.
 Multilevel moderate degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Widened right paratracheal
 stripe, unchanged, potentially due to underlying lymphadenopathy or
 mediastinal fat.
