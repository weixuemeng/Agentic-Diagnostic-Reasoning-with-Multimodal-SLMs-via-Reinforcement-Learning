                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left chest rib pain.  Evaluate for rib
 fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 rib fractures are identified.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. No pneumothorax or evidence of
 rib fracture.  If clinical concern for rib fracture is high, dedicated rib
