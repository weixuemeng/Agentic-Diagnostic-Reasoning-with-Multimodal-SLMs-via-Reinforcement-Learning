                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  New desaturations, prior history of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Perihilar
 opacities and increased interstitial markings suggest moderate pulmonary
 edema.  There is blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles which may be due to
 small pleural effusions.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The
 pulmonary nodules seen on prior chest CT from ___ were not as well
 appreciated on this study; however, CT is more sensitive and recommendations
 for that study remain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema, small bilateral effusions, mild
 cardiomegaly.
