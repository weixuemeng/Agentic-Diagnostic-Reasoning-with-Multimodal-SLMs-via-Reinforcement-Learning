                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and back pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The pulmonary vascular
 markings are indistinct, compatible with vascular congestion.  A 1.2 cm
 nodular opacity overlies the left mid-lung.  The hila are enlarged, suggesting
 lymphadenopathy.  The costophrenic angle are blunted, compatible with small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  No
 radiopaque foreign body.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Pulmonary vascular congestion with small bilateral pleural effusions.  
 2.  Left mid-lung nodular opacity, for which a non-emergent CT is recommended
 for further evaluation.
 3.  Enlarged hila, suggesting hilar lymphadenopathy.
