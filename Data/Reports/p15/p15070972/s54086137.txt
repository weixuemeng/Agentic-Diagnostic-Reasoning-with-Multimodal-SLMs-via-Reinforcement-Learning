                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with crackles bilteral hypoxia  // r/o pna  vs
 pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Examination is somewhat limited secondary to patient positioning.  There is
 relative increased density of the left hemi thorax as compared to the right,
 which likely relates to positioning of the patient in overlying soft tissues. 
 There is mild pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and fissural
 thickening are seen.  The heart is enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.    Relative increased density of the left hemithorax as compared to the
 right likely reflects overlying soft tissue in the setting of patient
 rotation.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema.
