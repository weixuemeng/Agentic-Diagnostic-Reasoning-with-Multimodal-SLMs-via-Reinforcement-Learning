                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New oxygen requirement and emesis.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged, unchanged.  There is new right lower lung opacity that
 given the patient's history might potentially represent aspiration.  Left
 basal opacity is noted as well, less conspicuous, but potentially represent
 aspiration.  Repeated radiograph for followup is required.
