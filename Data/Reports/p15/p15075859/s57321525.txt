                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Severe cardiomegaly is re-
 demonstrated with mild pulmonary edema, worse compared to the previous chest
 radiograph.  Widening of the superior mediastinum is likely due to underlying
 central lymphadenopathy, better detected on recent CT.  Small to moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right, are similar compared to the
 previous examinations.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect
 areas of atelectasis.  Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch are
 noted.  No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, larger
 on the right.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
