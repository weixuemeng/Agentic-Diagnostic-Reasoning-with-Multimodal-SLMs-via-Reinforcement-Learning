                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new shortness of breath.  // R/o overload vs
 pna      R/o overload vs pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 23:26
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 13:19 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A dual lead left-sided pacemaker remains in place. There is increasing opacity
 at the left base with a possible associated effusion. Although these findings
 could reflect atelectasis, an early pneumonia should also be considered in the
 correct clinical setting. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Apparent right sided
 superior mediastinal soft tissue may be related to patient positioning but
 also raises the possibility of substernal goiter.  Followup imaging with PA
 and lateral views would be advised.
