                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall with head strike.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___ and ___.  The images
 cannot be obtained from the PACS archiving system at the time of study
 reporting, but reference is made to the reports.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are
 well expanded and clear, without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature is engorged without overt pulmonary edema.
 Left pacemaker leads end in the expected locations of the right atrium and
 right ventricle. The heart is moderate enlarged. The aorta is tortuous, as
 described on the prior reports, but comparison cannot be made in the absence
 of the prior images. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. No pneumonia.
