                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a Y-stent in the trachea, now with
 worsening secretions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Bilateral small pleural effusions and
 extensive mediastinal adenopathy are stable.  Improved bibasilar atelectasis,
 without consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.   Known tracheal
 stent is not well visualized in the current study. Three rounded dense objects
 in the left paratracheal region, likely represent retained pills in the upper
 esophagus due to partial obstruction at this level by the mediastinal mass.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved bibasilar atelectasis. Retained pills in the upper
 thoracic esophagus.
