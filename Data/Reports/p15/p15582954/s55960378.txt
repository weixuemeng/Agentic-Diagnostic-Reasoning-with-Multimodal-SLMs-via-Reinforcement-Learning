 tortuous thoracic aorta.  Right PICC is unchanged in position with tip
 projecting over the mid SVC.  Bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions
 are increased compared to prior exam.  There is right greater than left basal
 opacity which is likely atelectasis however infection cannot be excluded. 
 There is no pneumothorax.

 Increase in bilateral pleural effusion now small to moderate in size with
 bibasilar right greater than left opacities which are likely atelectatic
 however infection cannot be excluded given the clinical circumstance.
