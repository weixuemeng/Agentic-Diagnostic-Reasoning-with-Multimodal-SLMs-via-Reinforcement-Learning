  Interval increase in bibasilar opacities is likely representative of
  increasing bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis. However, an
  overlying infectious process must be excluded in the proper clinical setting.
  Right IJ tip is now at the superior cavoatrial junction.

 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Repositioning of right PICC, now terminating in the lower superior
 vena cava.  Enlarging bilateral pleural effusions are present, now moderate on
 the right and small-to-moderate on the left, with adjacent areas of basilar
 opacification, which probably represent atelectasis and less likely aspiration
 or infectious pneumonia.
