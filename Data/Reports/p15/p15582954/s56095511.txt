                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and history of pneumonia as an outpatient.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC.  Esophageal stent is re-
 demonstrated in unchanged position.  The heart size is top normal.  The aorta
 is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Prominence of the mediastinal contour is
 unchanged, compatible with known small cell lung cancer.  There is mild
 pulmonary edema with moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
 left, slightly improved when compared to the prior exam.  Bibasilar opacities
 likely reflect compressive atelectasis but infection or aspiration is
 difficult to exclude.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Multiple clips are again
 demonstrated within the upper abdomen.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, and moderate size bilateral pleural effusions, minimally
 improved, with bibasilar compressive atelectasis.  Infection or aspiration of
 the lung bases is difficult to exclude.
