                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assess pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Mild improvement in bilateral pleural
 effusions, which are now small in size.  Bibasilar atelectasis have also
 improved.  Right upper extremity PICC terminates at the level of the mid SVC. 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with a mildly tortuous
 thoracic aorta.  An esophageal stent is unchanged in position.  Mild widening
 of the superior mediastinum, relates to the known esophageal cancer. No new
 consolidation or pneumothorax is seen. Emphysematous changes are seen in both
 lungs. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild decrease in the bilateral pleural effusions, which are now small. 
 Improved bibasilar atelectasis.
 2.  Right upper extremity PICC and esophageal stent, unchanged in position.
