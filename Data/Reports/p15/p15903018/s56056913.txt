                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yoM status post mechanical fall 1 day ago and acute mildly
 displaced left ___ and 11th rib fractures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided pacer device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium
 and right ventricle.  Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is present. Lung volumes
 are low which causes crowding of bronchovascular structures, but no overt
 pulmonary edema.  There is mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Right lateral pleural thickening is noted.  No
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine with slight loss of
 height of several lower vertebral bodies of indeterminate age.  Clips project
 over the posterior upper abdomen.  Reported fractures of the left tenth and
 eleventh ribs are not well assessed on the current exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumonia.
