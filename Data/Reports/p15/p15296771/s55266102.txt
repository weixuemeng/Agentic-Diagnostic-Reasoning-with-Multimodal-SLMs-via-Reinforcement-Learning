                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Choking on pill with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Diffuse coarse interstitial opacities are most pronounced within
 the periphery of the right upper lung field and left lung base concerning for
 a chronic interstitial lung disease which appears relatively unchanged
 compared to the prior exam.  No pulmonary edema is visualized, and no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change from the prior study with findings
 suggestive of a chronic interstitial lung disease.  This can be further
 assessed with high-resolution chest CT.
