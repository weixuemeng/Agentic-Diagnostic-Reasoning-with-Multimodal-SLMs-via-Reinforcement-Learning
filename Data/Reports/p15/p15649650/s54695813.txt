                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:18 AM ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with stroke and leukocytosis.  History of colon
 carcinoma with lung metastases.  Suspect infection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is worsened.  Left atrium and pulmonary
 arteries are more dilated today than previously.  No pulmonary edema is
 present and pleural effusion if any is minimal.  It is difficult to tell
 whether there are small lung nodules or rib metastases.  There may be both. 
 CT scanning would be more helpful in characterization.  No pneumothorax.
