                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a nodular opacity
 projecting adjacent to the right interlobar artery which was also faintly seen
 on the prior study and likely represents overlap of vascular structures. 
 Aortic tortuosity is unchanged.  The heart size is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
