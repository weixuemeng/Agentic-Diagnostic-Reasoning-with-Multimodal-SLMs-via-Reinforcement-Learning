                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Patient rotation slightly limits the exam. Heart size remains mild to
 moderately enlarged.  Mild pulmonary edema is present.  Retrocardiac
 opacification and small to moderate size left pleural effusion are new
 compared with the previous exam.  Small right pleural effusion is also seen. 
 Rounded opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle is unchanged and likely
 reflective of a pericardial cyst.  No pneumothorax is present.  Degenerative
 changes of both acromioclavicular joints are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with moderate size left and small right pleural
 effusion.  Retrocardiac opacification could reflect compressive atelectasis
 but infection cannot be excluded.  Rounded opacity within the right
 cardiophrenic angle appears unchanged and likely reflects a pericardial cyst.
