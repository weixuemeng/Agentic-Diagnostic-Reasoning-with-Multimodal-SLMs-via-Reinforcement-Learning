                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant pain with tenderness along the chest wall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Mild degenerative changes are again seen along the
 spine.  No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced fracture seen.  However, if
 clinical concern for rib fracture is high, suggest dedicated rib series, which
 is more sensitive.
