                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Wheeze, recent aspiration witnessed, with sepsis of unclear
 etiology, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VW
 
 COMPARISON:  No previous ___ radiographs on PACS record for comparison.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly.  The aorta is calcified, but only minimally unfolded.  There is
 prominence of the hila, with a tapered appearance, which may reflect pulmonary
 hypertension.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  There
 is minimal atelectasis at the right base peripherally and minimal atelectasis
 at the left base.  Possible trace pleural fluid at the right costophrenic
 angle.  However, no focal infiltrate is identified to suggest an area of
 aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia.  
 
 2-cm calcified nodular structure immediately to the left of the trachea above
 the medial clavicular head on the left could represent either a calcified
 lymph node or calcified thyroid nodule.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  COPD, cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution. 
 
 2.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis and possible trace right pleural fluid.  No
 focal infiltrate to suggest pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis.
 
 3.  Nodular calcification at the thoracic in let on the left --  
 ?calcified lymph node or thyroid nodule. If clinically indicated, ultrasound
 could help to further assess this.
