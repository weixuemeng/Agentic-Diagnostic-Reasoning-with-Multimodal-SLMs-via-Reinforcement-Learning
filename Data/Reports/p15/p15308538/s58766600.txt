                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are well expanded. 
 Linear oblique opacity at the right base is compatible with atelectasis. 
 There is a sharp triangular opacity along the right heart border.  In
 addition, there is a focal sclerotic lesion overlying the proximal right
 clavicle.  There is no consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Sclerotic lesion within the proximal right clavicle.
 
 2. Triangular right heart border may be due to prominent mediastinal fat or
 adhesion in the pleural space.
