                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia  // infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  Patchy right lower lung field opacities
 are unchanged since the prior examination.  The central pulmonary vasculature
 is engorged, similar to prior, likely consistent with pulmonary edema. 
 Possible, small bilateral pleural effusions are present.  Upper lung lucencies
 reflect emphysema. No definite focal consolidation is identified, though is
 not entirely excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.  No definite
 focal consolidation identified.
