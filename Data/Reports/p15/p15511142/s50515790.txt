 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with respiratory failure status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube is seen with
 tip approximately 5 cm from the carina.  There are bilateral parenchymal
 opacities, in the right mid-to-lower lung with dense retrocardiac opacity as
 well.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  Atherosclerotic calcifications seen at
 the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dense left basilar opacity could be due to combination of
 effusion, atelectasis and consolidation.  Bilateral parenchymal opacities more
 superiorly suggest pulmonary edema.  Cardiomegaly.
