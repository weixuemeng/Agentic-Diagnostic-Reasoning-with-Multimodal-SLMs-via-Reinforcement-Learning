                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cough, shortness of breath, and
 feels like lungs are wet.  Evaluate for possible CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The configuration suggests a
 prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left and posteriorly, but
 there is also some evidence of left atrial enlargement in the form of a
 right-sided cardiac double contour and prominence of the heart shadow at the
 atrial level as seen on the lateral view.  The pulmonary vasculature
 demonstrates an upper zone re-distribution pattern with relatively distended
 pulmonary vessels in the upper zone and some beginning increased interstitial
 structures on the lung bases.  There is very mild blunting of the right
 lateral pleural sinus and a similar finding is noted on the lateral view. 
 Acute discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are not present, nor is there
 evidence of central pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen in the apical
 area.  Skeletal structures of the thorax are grossly unremarkable.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiac enlargement with evidence of beginning pulmonary
 congestion.  Findings compatible with diastolic CHF, resulting in mild degree
 of pulmonary congestion.  Followup examination after treatment could
 demonstrate reversal of beginning pulmonary congestive pattern.
