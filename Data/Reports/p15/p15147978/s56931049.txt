                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with worsening altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy with the superior most wire again
 appearing broken.  Cardiac silhouette size appears normal, unchanged. 
 Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Hilar prominence bilaterally reflects
 enlargement of the pulmonary arteries, as seen previously.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  A moderate-sized left pleural effusion appears slightly
 increased compared to the previous radiograph with left basilar opacification
 likely reflective of compressive atelectasis.  Small right pleural effusion
 appears similar with atelectasis/scarring noted in the right lung base.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Deformity of the right rib cage is unchanged.  Marked
 degenerative changes are noted involving the left glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate left pleural effusion, slightly increased in size compared to the
 previous study with left basilar opacification, likely compressive
 atelectasis.
 2. Trace right pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis/scarring.
 3. Suggests underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
