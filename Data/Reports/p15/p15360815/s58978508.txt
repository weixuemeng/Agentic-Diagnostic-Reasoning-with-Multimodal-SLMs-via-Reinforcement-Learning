                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p R IJ, line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph in semi upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed 1 hr prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right IJ terminates within the right atrium. Again seen is an opacity at the
 right apex, slightly increased since prior study.  There is now heterogeneous
 opacity at the left lung base.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Right IJ terminates within the right atrium. Unchanged opacity at the right
 lung apex, slightly increased since prior study.
 
 2.  Heterogeneous opacity at the left lung base, which may be related to low
 lung volumes, but CTA chest is recommended to rule out an infectious process.
