                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rib fractures with decreased breath sounds, to assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is now an endotracheal
 tube in place with its tip approximately 3.7 cm above the carina.  No definite
 pneumothorax, though there is substantial subcutaneous gas along the left
 chest wall and extending up into the neck and down to the abdomen.  Low lung
 volumes may account for much of the prominence of the transverse diameter of
 the heart.  Bibasilar atelectatic changes, more prominent on the left.
 
 At least one of the left rib fractures can be seen on this frontal radiograph.
