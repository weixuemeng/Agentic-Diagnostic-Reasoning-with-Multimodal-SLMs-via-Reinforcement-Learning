                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left rib fractures, persistent oxygen requirements.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the displaced left rib
 fractures are unchanged in appearance.  Mildly more obvious than on the
 previous exam is an elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, potentially caused by
 increased gas filling of the colon.  As a consequence, areas of atelectasis
 are seen at both lung bases, left more than right.  No other changes. 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and overall, low lung volumes.  No evidence of
 pneumonia.  No larger pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
