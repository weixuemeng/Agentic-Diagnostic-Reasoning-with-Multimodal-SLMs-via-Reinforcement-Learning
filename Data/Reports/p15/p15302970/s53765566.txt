                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  The heart size is top
 normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is
 present.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis but
 infection cannot be excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities could reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded. 
 Consider repeat PA and lateral views with improved inspiratory effort when the
 patient is able.
