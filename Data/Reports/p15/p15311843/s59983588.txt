                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p fall down 5 stairs, EtOH 344 at OSH, intubated at OSH due
 to combativeness, tx to BI due to small SDH  // NGT placement, interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from 1 day prior
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates in the mid thoracic trachea.  The enteric tube is
 been retracted and now terminates in the mid esophagus.  Lung volumes are low
 and there is bibasilar opacification, left greater than right, which likely
 reflects atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Malposition of the enteric tube, terminating in the mid esophagus, should
 be removed and replaced.
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis and low lung volumes.
