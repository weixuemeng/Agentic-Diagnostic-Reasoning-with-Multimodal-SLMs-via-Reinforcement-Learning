                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with pancreatitis  // eval for effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Midline sternotomy wires,
 mediastinal and upper abdominal clips are again noted. Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are again noted. The heart is top-normal in size. Mediastinal
 contour is normal. Mild atelectasis at the bases better assessed on same-day
 CT. Scattered areas of atelectasis likely account for reticular opacities
 within the lungs. A more nodular opacity projects over the left upper lung. No
 free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions. Scattered atelectasis. Possible nodule on
 the left upper lung, for which dedicated PA and lateral views recommended to
