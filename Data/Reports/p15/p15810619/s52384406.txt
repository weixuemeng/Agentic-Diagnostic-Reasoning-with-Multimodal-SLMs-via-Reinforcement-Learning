 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, crackles noted in
 the lungs, assess for infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  The previously noted
 pleural effusions have resolved in the interval.  There is no focal
 consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  No signs of pulmonary edema or
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contour
 is unremarkable, though faint atherosclerotic calcifications are noted along
 the aortic knob.  The bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval resolution of bilateral pleural effusions.  No acute
 findings.
