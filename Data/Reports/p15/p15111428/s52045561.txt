                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with left-sided chest pain and cough for two
 months.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Evaluation of the
 lung parenchyma is limited by body habitus.  Lung volumes remain low, as they
 have been in prior years.  There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Persistently low lung volumes.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  HRCT is
 better for evaluation of interstitial lung disease, if suspected.
