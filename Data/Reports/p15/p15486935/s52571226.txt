 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the cavoatrial junction.  Heart size
 is normal.  The aorta is tortuous, unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Streaky
 opacities within the retrocardiac region may reflect atelectasis.  Right lung
 is clear.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Compression deformities of several thoracic vertebral bodies within the mid
 and lower thoracic spine appear unchanged with associated kyphosis.

 Streaky retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis.  Infection is not
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
