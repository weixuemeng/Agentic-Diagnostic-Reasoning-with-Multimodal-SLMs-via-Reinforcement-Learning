 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MM  // Tc 103, evaluate for infectious
 process      Tc 103, evaluate for infectious process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Port-A-Cath catheter tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Heart size is
 normal.  Tortuous aorta is re- demonstrated.  There is left basal opacity,
 that appears to be improved since the prior study and no other consolidations
 to suggest infectious process demonstrated.  If clinically warranted,
 correlation with chest CT is to be considered to exclude the possibility of
 radiographically occult infectious process.
