                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post MVC, now with low oxygen saturation.
 
 STUDY:  Portable semi-upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no fracture.  The heart size
 and mediastinal contours are exaggerated by low lung volumes and technique. 
 Although lung volumes are low, no consolidation is present.  Repeat
 radiographs are recommended for better characterization.
