 HISTORY:  Chest pain.

 FINDINGS:  There is mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity
 of the thoracic aorta.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no fluid
 overload or interstitial edema.  The lungs are clear. Blunting of the
 posterior costophrenic angles is suggestive of small effusions. There is no
 pneumothorax.
