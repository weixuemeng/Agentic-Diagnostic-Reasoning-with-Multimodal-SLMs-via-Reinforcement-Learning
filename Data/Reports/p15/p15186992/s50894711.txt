                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD and emphysema, admitted with subdural hematoma, question of
 new infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___ and CT chest on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  ONE AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST.  A previously seen
 cavity in the left lung is no longer present.  In that location, there are
 linear interstitial opacities likely from fibrosis from scarring in that area
 or may represent pneumonia.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are low lung
 volumes.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Linear opacities in the left mid lung may represent residual scarring from
 prior cavitary lesion or could represent new pneumonia.
 
 2.  Right basilar atelectasis.
