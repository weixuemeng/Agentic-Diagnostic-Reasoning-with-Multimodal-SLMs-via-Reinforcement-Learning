                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with altered mental status, leukocytosis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Heart size is moderately enlarged.  Mediastinum appears
 widened but this is likely due to supine positioning and AP technique. The
 aortic arch and contour remain distinct. There is mild upper zone vascular
 redistribution with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness compatible
 with mild pulmonary congestion. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Atelectasis is seen in the lung bases. Moderate
 degenerative changes are again noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
