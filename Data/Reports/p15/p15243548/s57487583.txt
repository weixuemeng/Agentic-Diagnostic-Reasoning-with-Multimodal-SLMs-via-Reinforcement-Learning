                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, low-grade fevers and left lung
 rales.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and PET-CT ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Heart size remains mildly enlarged with a
 left ventricular predominance. Diffuse calcification of the thoracic aorta is
 noted. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Fiducial seeds are
 seen within a right lower lobe lesion as well as within the left lower lobe
 lesion with surrounding ill-defined opacity, as demonstrated on prior CT. 
 Right apical lung nodules redemonstrated, but better demonstrated on a recent
 CT.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.   Known lytic lesion involving the distal left
 clavicle is not well visualized on current exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill-defined opacities in both lower lobes at the site of prior
 radiation therapy treatment, which could reflect radiation pneumonitis, though
 infection is not excluded.  Findings appear similar compared to recent CT. 
 Right apical nodule is redemonstrated, again better demonstrated on recent CT.
