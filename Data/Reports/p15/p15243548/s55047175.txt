                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer with ill-defined opacities in the right mid zone, to
 assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued
 opacities in the lower lobes at the site of previous radiation therapy
 treatment.  This could reflect radiation pneumonitis.  There appears to be
 some increased coalescence of the area of opacification.  The overall
 appearance is relatively similar compared to recent CT scan.  The right apical
 nodule was better seen on the prior CT scan.
 
 There are continued atelectatic changes bilaterally.
