                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left MCA stroke and history of metastatic non-small cell, assess
 for extent cancer and possible infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are low in volume with slight increase opacity surrounding
 the fiducial markers noted in the right mid lung and left base.  Right apical
 nodule also appears larger, though comparison between the prior study is
 limited due to differences in technique. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Apparent slight increase in right apical nodule, possibly due to
 differences in technique.
 2. Slight increase in opacification surrounding known nodule sites with
 fiducial markers, which could reflect continued evolution of post radiation
 change, though infection cannot be excluded. PA and lateral CXR when
 clinically feasible will be helpful in further assessment.
