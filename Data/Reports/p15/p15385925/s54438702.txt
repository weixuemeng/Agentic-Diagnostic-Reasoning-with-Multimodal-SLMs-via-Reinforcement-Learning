                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 22:26
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with acute dyspnea, pulmonary edema,
 infiltrate.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 22:26 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A single-lead right-sided pacer remains intact with the leads terminating
 over the expected location of right ventricle.  There is increasing vascular
 congestion likely reflecting worsening mild pulmonary edema.  In addition,
 there are likely layering small effusions, left greater than right, with some
 associated patchy airspace process likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. 
 A superimposed infectious process would be less likely.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There is a slightly asymmetric right apical pleural thickening
 which is unchanged since ___ and therefore likely reflects
 post-inflammatory changes.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.
