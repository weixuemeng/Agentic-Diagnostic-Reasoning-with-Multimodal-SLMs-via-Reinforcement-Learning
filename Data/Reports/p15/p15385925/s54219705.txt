 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:16 A.M. 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with heart failure and worsening dyspnea,
 assess for change in pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP semi-upright portable chest film ___ at 4:16 a.m. is
 submitted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right-sided pacer remains in place.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely stably enlarged given differences in patient positioning
 and rotation.  There has been interval improvement in the mild pulmonary edema
 with residual vascular congestion and patchy opacities at both bases which are
 slightly less consolidative favoring resolving edema.  Probable layering left
 effusion and possibly a smaller effusion on the right.  No pneumothorax.
