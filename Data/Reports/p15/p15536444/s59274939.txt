  Small left pleural effusion with left lower lobe atelectasis.
  Increased opacity projecting over the inferior right hilum, not definitively
  normal hilar structures.  Consider nonurgent chest CT for further
  characterization of these findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with GI bleeding  // ?free air ?pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left base opacity compatible with a layering pleural effusion as well as left
 lower lobe atelectasis. There is likely also a trace right pleural effusion as
 well.  There is increased opacity projecting over the right infrahilar region
 which is not felt to be entirely due to hilar vasculature.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear.  Cardiac silhouette is top-normal in size for projection.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities.  No free intraperitoneal air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion with left lower lobe atelectasis.
 Increased opacity projecting over the inferior right hilum, not definitively
 normal hilar structures.  Consider nonurgent chest CT for further
 characterization of these findings.
