 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of bullet in thoracic

 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Radiopaque

 hemithorax, to the right of midline.  It is not well seen on the lateral view,
 which may relate to overlapping structures and technique and its AP location
 is difficult to discern.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No prior chest radiograph available
 for comparison of location of bullet.
