                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  An incompletely marginated
 round 1.2 cm diameter opacity is present in the periphery of the right upper
 lung, at the level of the intersection of the right fourth anterior and
 seventh posterior ribs.  Lungs are otherwise clear, and there are no pleural
 effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No CT findings to suggest the presence of pneumonia.
 
 2.  1.2 cm opacity in right upper lung as described, possibly representing a
 skin lesion or a structure external to the patient.  Recommend initial further
 evaluation with repeat chest radiograph.  If the patient has a skin lesion on
 the right chest wall, a marker could be placed on this region at the time of
 followup radiograph to assist in localization.  
 
 Findings entered into radiology communications dashboard on date of study.
