                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate an ill-defined right
 hilar opacity, projecting as a double density on the lateral view, as well as
 scattered nodularity in the right upper and lower lobes.  The heart size is
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right hilar opacity and right lung nodularity could represent
 multifocal pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Follow-up
 radiographs should be obtained after treatment to ensure resolution, and if
 still present, a dedicated chest CT is recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were posted to the online critical results
 radiology dashboard by Dr. ___ at 8:40pm on ___ for provider
 ___.
