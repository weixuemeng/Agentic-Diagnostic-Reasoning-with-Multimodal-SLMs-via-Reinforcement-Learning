 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.  2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low with adjacent bibasilar compressive atelectasis.  The
 heart size is difficult to evaluate due to low lung volumes.  Mediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are otherwise clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The osseous structures are
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation worrisome
 for pneumonia.  No interstitial edema.
