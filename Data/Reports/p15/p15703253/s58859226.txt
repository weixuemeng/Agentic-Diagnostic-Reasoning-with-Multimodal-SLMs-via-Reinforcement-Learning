                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with COPD and worsening cough with myalgias
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Streaky opacities are noted in
 the lung bases which may reflect areas of atelectasis.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated.  Previously noted right middle lobe nodule seen on CT is not
 well assessed on the current radiograph.  There are mild multilevel
 degenerative changes seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Streaky bibasilar atelectasis without focal consolidation.
 2. Known right middle lobe nodule seen on prior CT is not well assessed on the
 current radiograph.  As was recommended at the time of the previous CT,
 followup chest CT should have performed within 3 months, and correlation with
 any previous imaging is recommended.  If this follow up chest CT has not
 occurred, then a non-emergent follow up chest CT is recommended to be done at
 this time.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Known right middle lobe nodule seen on prior CT is not
 well assessed on the current radiograph. As was recommended at the time of the
 previous CT, followup chest CT should have performed within 3 months, and
 correlation with any previous imaging is recommended.  If this follow up chest
 CT has not occurred, then a non-emergent follow up chest CT is recommended to
 be done at this time.
