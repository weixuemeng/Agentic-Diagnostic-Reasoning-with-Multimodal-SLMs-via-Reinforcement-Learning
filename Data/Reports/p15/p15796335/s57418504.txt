                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided chest tube remains in place with a persistent small
 right pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are remarkable for
 pneumomediastinum which has developed since the prior examination, and is also
 associated with new subcutaneous emphysema within the supraclavicular regions.
 Endotracheal tube has been slightly advanced, and now terminates about 6.4 cm
 above the carina.  Other indwelling devices are unchanged in position.  Right
 basilar atelectasis is slightly improved.  Otherwise, no relevant changes
 since recent study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New pneumomediastinum with associated subcutaneous emphysema in both
 supraclavicular regions.
 
 2.  Small right pneumothorax with a chest tube in place.
 
 ___ has been contacted by telephone on ___ at 8:30 a.m.
