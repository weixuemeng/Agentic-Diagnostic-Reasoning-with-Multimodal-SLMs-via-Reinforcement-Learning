                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the catheters as well as the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The
 costophrenic angle on the left is sharp.  It is unclear whether this
 represents merely change in patient position or clearing of the left pleural
 effusion.
 
 No evidence of acute consolidation or vascular congestion.  The malpositioned
 PICC line on the left has been removed, as has been the subclavian catheter.
