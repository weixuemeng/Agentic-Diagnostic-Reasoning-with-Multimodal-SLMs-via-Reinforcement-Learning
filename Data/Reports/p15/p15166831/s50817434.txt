                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recent right lower lobe pneumonia improving
 clinically after second course of antibiotics.  Assess for resolution.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Consolidation which worsened between ___ and ___, predominantly
 in the right lower lobe, has improved minimally but is far from resolved. 
 Small right pleural effusion present on the ___ study has cleared.  There
 are no findings to suggest central adenopathy, but subtle bronchial
 obstruction might not be revealed by conventional radiography.  Hyperinflation
 and relative translucency in the upper lungs are strongly suggestive of
 emphysema.  Eventration of the left hemidiaphragm is chronic.  Heart size is
 normal.
 
 Unless there is a ready explanation for failure to resolve this pneumonia, CT
 scanning would be indicated at this time.
