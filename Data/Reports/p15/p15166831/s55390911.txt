                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Known COPD, frequent pneumonia, fevers, and decreased breath
 sounds.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing opacities
 in the right lung, both at the level of the right hilus and at the lung bases
 on the right have almost completely cleared.  The current image shows no newly
 appeared parenchymal opacities.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm persists.
 Contrast in the stomach and intestine in the left upper quadrant.
