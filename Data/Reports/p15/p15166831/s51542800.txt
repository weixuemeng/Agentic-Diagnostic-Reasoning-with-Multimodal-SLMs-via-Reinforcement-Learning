                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  There remains marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  New
 increased opacity in the left retrocardiac region adjacent to an increasingly
 elevated left hemidiaphragm could reflect atelectasis or aspiration given the
 clinical suspicion for the latter entity.  A subcentimeter nodular opacity in
 the level of the right third anterior rib is again demonstrated and previously
 carried a recommendation for followup chest radiographs.  Linear opacities at
 right lung base are consistent with atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Left lower lobe atelectasis or aspiration.
 Persistent nodular opacity right ___ anterior rib level.
 PA and lateral CXR are recommended for more complete evaluation of these
 findings when the patient's condition permits.
