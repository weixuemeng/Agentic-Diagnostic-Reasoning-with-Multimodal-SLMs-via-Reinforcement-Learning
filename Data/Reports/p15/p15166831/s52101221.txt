                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, shortness of breath, hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 There is mild prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature without frank
 interstitial edema.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged since at
 least ___.  Bibasilar atelectasis is mild.  Diffuse areas of
 increased bilateral parenchymal opacity likely corresponds to numerous areas
 of ground-glass opacities seen on recent chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle areas of bilateral increased parenchymal opacities, right
 greater than left likely corresponding to peribronchovascular ground-glass
 opacities on CT suggestive of pneumonia.
