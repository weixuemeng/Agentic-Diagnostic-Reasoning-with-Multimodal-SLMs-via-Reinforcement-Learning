                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever, cough, shortness of breath.  Question
 recurrence of pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 New heterogeneous opacification in the axillary region of the left lung is
 most likely recent aspiration or pneumonia.  Other regions of more chronic
 parenchymal abnormality at the right lung base and axillary region of the
 right lung may also be aspiration-related, but have not recently changed.
 
 Marked relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is longstanding, dating
 from ___, but slowly progressive since then, even more pronounced relative to
 ___.  Whether this is an eventrated or paralyzed left hemidiaphragm
 is radiographically indeterminate.
 
 Particularly on the lateral view, there is a very sharp definition of bowel
 wall by air both inside and outside the uppermost bowel loops, distended with
 both air and fluid.  Whether this represents pneumoperitoneum or bowel loops
 defined by apposition of dilated loops is hard to say. Dr ___ ___ I
 discussed this finding by telephone and the need for additional radiographic
 investigation if the patient has any referable symptomatology to exclude
 pneumoperitoneum.
