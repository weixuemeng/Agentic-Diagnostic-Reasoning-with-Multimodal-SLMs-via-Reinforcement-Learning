                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:11
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory distress status post
 intubation.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 3:38.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 5:11 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval intubation with the tip of the endotracheal tube 5.5 cm above the
 carina.  Improved aeration of both lungs, particularly on the left side. 
 There is diffuse airspace process in the right lung as well as more patchy
 focal process at the left lung base.  These findings could reflect asymmetric
 pulmonary edema, although bilateral pneumonia should also be considered. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Previously reported
 more focal nodular opacity in the right upper lobe again is not well
 appreciated on the current study due to the diffuse airspace process.  Spinal
 fusion hardware overlying the lower cervical spine is incompletely visualized.
