                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 519 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post C3 to C6 spinal fusion, respiratory
 distress, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 5:50 a.m.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 519 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube continues to lie 5.5 cm above the carina.  There is a
 persistent opacification and consolidation at the left lung base which may
 represent an area of pneumonia, although it is possible that this could also
 reflect worsening lobar atelectasis in the setting of a layering effusion as
 the pulmonary vasculature is now more ill defined consistent with superimposed
 pulmonary edema.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
