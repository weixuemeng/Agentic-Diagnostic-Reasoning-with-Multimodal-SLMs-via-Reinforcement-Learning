                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 3:38 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with desaturation, status post cervical
 fusion.  Question pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 22:17.
 
 A single portable upright chest film, ___ at 4 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval appearance of diffuse airspace process, most likely representing
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, less likely diffuse pneumonia.  There is
 persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with adjacent more confluent
 airspace opacity, which could reflect confluent pulmonary edema or an area of
 atelectasis.  There is some overlying motion artifact on the study as well. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess but likely unchanged.
 Portion of the spinal fusion hardware is seen overlying the lower cervical
 spine.  The described right upper lobe nodular opacity is not well appreciated
 on the current study due to the diffuse airspace process.
