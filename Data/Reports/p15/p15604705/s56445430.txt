                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain radiating through to the back, evaluate for acute
 process or dissection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal upright and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung
 volumes.  Accounting for differences in patient's position, cardiomediastinal
 contour is relatively unchanged compared to the prior examination.  Heart is
 normal in size.  Thoracic aorta appears tortuous, similar to the prior
 examination.  Focal rounded areas of increased density at the hila bilaterally
 likely represent calcified hilar nodes, unchanged from the prior examination. 
 Basilar streaky opacities are most consistent with atelectasis.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear without focal areas of consolidation.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
