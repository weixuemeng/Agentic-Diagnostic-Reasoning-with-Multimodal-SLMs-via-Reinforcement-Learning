                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall  // ro rib fractures, infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with concurrently obtained radiographs the
 right shoulder, as well as radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is hyperexpansion of the lungs, with flattening of both hemidiaphragms,
 compatible with COPD. Right upper lobe scarring and pleural thickening is
 likely unchanged compared to the prior study, given differences in patient
 positioning. There is no overt pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or focal
 consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  There is likely a small left pleural
 effusion and/or pleural thickening at the left lung base. Irregular
 calcification in the right lateral breast is better assessed on prior
 mammogram. Right proximal humeral fracture is again noted.  No displaced rib
 fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.  Findings compatible with COPD.  Right proximal
 humeral fracture is better characterized on separately dictated shoulder
 radiographs.  No displaced rib fractures seen.
