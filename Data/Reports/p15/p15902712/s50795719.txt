                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with ALS and BiPAP dependency with low oxygen
 saturation.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates the patient to be
 rotated to the left.  The heart is top normal in size, but likely accentuated
 by AP technique.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 There is dense retrocardiac opacity which could represent dependent
 atelectasis, accompanied by a small left pleural effusion.  The right base
 similarly demonstrates streaky opacities, likely atelectasis.  There is also a
 small pleural effusion on the right.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities accompanied by small pleural effusions,
 likely represent compressive atelectasis, although an evolving pneumonia in
 the left lower lobe cannot be excluded purely by imaging appearance.
