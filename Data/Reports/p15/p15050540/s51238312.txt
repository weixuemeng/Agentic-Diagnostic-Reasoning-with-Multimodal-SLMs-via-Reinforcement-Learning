                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p lap chole now with some SOB.  // please
 evaluate for effusions/edema      please evaluate for effusions/edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are much lower lung
 volumes.There is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 increased pulmonary venous pressure.  Opacification at the bases is consistent
 with atelectasis effusion, more prominent on the left.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, it would be difficult to definitely exclude superimposed
 pneumonia, spot especially in the absence of lateral view.
