 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is little overall change.  Again
 there are low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and some
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  .  Bibasilar opacifications are less
 prominent, though this could merely reflect a more erect position of the
 patient so that the findings of bilateral pleural effusions has a different
 appearance.
