 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is still
 enlarged though less prominent, possibly reflecting the PA rather than AP
 view.  Similarly, the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion has
 substantially decreased, which could also partly be a manifestation of the
 more erect position of the patient.  No evidence of pleural effusion or acute
 focal pneumonia.
 Clips are again seen in the left axillary region.
