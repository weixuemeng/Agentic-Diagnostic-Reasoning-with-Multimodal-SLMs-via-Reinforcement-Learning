                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, fever and rigidity.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube, enteric tube and right PICC line are
 unchanged in position.  The right PICC still ends in the proximal right atrium
 and should be retracted approximately 3 cm to place in the low SVC.  Vascular
 congestion is increased from the prior study without overt edema.  The lung
 volumes are slightly decreased from ___.  No significant pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  There is persistent plate-like atelectasis at the
 right lung base and mild left basilar atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right PICC ending in the proximal right atrium should be retracted 2-3 cm
 to place in the low SVC.
 2.  Unchanged low lung volumes and mild bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  Increased pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Finding #1 was communicated by Dr. ___ to IV nurse,
 ___, via pager at approximately 10:30 a.m. on ___.
