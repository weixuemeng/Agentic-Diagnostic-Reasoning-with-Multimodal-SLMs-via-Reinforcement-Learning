                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with bandemia and shortness of breath.  No
 identified source.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest x-ray and CT abdomen from earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  There is no confluent consolidation. 
 Streaky bibasilar opacities are seen with increased interstitial markings
 compatible with atelectasis and bronchiectasis seen on CT scan.  There is no
 effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears slightly enlarged but this
 is likely due to a relatively lower lung volumes on the current exam.  No
 acute osseous abnormality identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis and bronchiectasis in without definite acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
