  1.  Increased left mid to lower lung opacities, possibly aspiration
  pneumonitis or pneumonia.
  
  1.  Bilateral lower lung heterogeneous opacities, likely atelectasis, although
  infection is certainly possible at either lung base.
  
  2.  Small right and trace left pleural effusions, not significantly changed.
  
  3.  Left subclavian central venous catheter ends at the confluence of the
  brachiocephalic veins, previously seen to be within the superior-most portion
  of the SVC.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pelvic mass, now with sepsis and respiratory failure.  Assess for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular large-bore central venous catheter ends in
 the mid SVC, unchanged.  An endotracheal tube ends 2.5 cm above the level of
 the carina.  A left subclavian central venous catheter ends near the
 confluence of the brachiocephalic veins, previously seen to end within the
 uppermost portion of the SVC.  An enteric catheter courses below the level of
 the diaphragm, ending in the proximal duodenum, not significantly changed. 
 Lung volumes remain very low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and
 accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  Bilateral lower lung heterogeneous
 opacities are likely atelectasis, although infection in either lung base is
 certainly possible.  There has been an interval increase in left mid to lower
 lung opacities, possibly aspiration or pneumonia.  Small right and probable
 trace left pleural effusions are not significantly changed compared to the
 prior radiograph from ___.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is not significantly changed.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 There is no pneumothorax.

 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 12:02 p.m. via
