                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:43 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a new Dobbhoff tube in place.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Feeding tube with a wire stylet in place ends in the upper esophagus.  ET
 tube, left subclavian and right internal jugular catheters in standard
 placements.  Lung volumes are quite low, exaggerating the severity of mild
 pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 small to moderate.  Heart size normal.  Very large calcified mitral annulus
 could be responsible for mitral regurgitation.
 
 Subsequent chest radiograph showed repositioning of standard upper enteric
 drainage catheter and removal of the errant feeding tube.
