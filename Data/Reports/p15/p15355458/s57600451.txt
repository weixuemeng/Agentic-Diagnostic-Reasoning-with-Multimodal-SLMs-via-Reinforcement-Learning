                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with ovarian cancer, bacteroides bacteremia and
 worsening tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable kyphotic upright chest radiograph demonstrates little
 change in low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis, although the pulmonary
 vasculature appears more indistinct suggesting interval development of
 pulmonary vascular engorgement and mild pulmonary edema. Pleural effusion is
 minimal if any. The central airways are heavily calcified. The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged, the mediastinal contours are indistinct.  
 
 A left subclavian approach central venous catheter tip is positioned at the
 confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and SVC with the tip projecting
 laterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 pulmonary edema superimposed upon chronic low lung volumes with bibasilar
 atelectasis.
