 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with probable cancer, sepsis and
 hypotension.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the previous study from ___.
 
 The endotracheal tube, right IJ line, and nasogastric tube appear unchanged in
 position.  There is also a left-sided central line with distal lead tip which
 is perpendicular to the mid SVC wall.  The heart size is enlarged.  There are
 bilateral pleural effusions and left retrocardiac opacity.  There are low lung
 volumes due to poor inspiratory effort since the previous study.  Allowing for
 this, is no significant change.  There are no pneumothoraces.
