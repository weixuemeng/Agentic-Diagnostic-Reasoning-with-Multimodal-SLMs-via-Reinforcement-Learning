                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with possible T8, evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding.  Moderate dextroscoliosis of
 the thoracic spine is unchanged.  Indistinct opacity at the left costophrenic
 angle most likely represents atelectasis.  A small focal consolidation cannot
 be entirely excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Indistinct left costophrenic angle may represent atelectasis related to low
 lung volumes or a small focal consolidation.
