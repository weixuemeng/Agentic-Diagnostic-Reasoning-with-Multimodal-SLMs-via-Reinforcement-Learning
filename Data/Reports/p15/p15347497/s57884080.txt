                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with syncope  // evidence of pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___ radiograph, cardiomediastinal contours are stable
 allowing for accentuation by low lung volumes, which also result in crowding
 of bronchovascular structures at the lung bases.  Bibasilar linear opacities
 are suggestive of atelectasis.  No definite evidence of pneumonia, but repeat
 radiograph with improved inspiratory level may be helpful for more complete
 assessment of the lungs if clinical suspicion for pneumonia persists.
