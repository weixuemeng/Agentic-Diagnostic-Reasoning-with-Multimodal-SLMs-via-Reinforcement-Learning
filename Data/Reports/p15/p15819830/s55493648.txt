                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates
 within the mid SVC.  Moderate size hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated.  There
 is also dilatation of the esophagus with an air-fluid level, similar compared
 to the prior exam.  Chronic radiation changes are noted in the right apex. 
 Linear opacities within the left lower lobe likely reflect atelectasis.  No
 new areas of focal consolidation are present.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Known sclerotic metastases
 are better seen on the recent CT.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate size hiatal hernia with chronic dilatation of the esophagus
 containing an air-fluid level.  Mild atelectasis in the left lower lobe and
 chronic radiation changes in the right apex.  No focal consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.
