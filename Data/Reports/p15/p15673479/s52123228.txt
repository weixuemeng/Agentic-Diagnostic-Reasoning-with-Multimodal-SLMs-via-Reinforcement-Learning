                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PNA and ILD with fevers on abx  //
 evaluate worsening PNA      evaluate worsening PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ dilated head chest
 CT scans ___ and ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The multifocal infiltrative pulmonary abnormality worsened appreciably between
 ___ and ___ suggesting that the interval change may have been
 largely edema.  It improved on ___, some of which was due to a marked
 increase in lung volumes.  Today's study is comparable lung volume to the
 earlier radiograph on ___, showing that indeed there has been  some
 improvement, but there is multifocal peribronchial pulmonary abnormality that
 has progressed since ___.  Differential diagnosis includes atypical
 infection, and if the patient is immunocompromised, Pneumocystis.
 
 Heart size is top-normal cava, so cardiac decompensation may still be a
 feature.
