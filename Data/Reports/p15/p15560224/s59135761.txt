                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F s/p "swallowing pen" hx of swallowing foreign
 objects  // ? foreign body - ? placement
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A 5.6 x 3.4 mm radiopaque density, likely metallic , overlies the mediastinum
 in the midline, posterior to the mainstem bronchus on the lateral view.  The
 shape is compatible with a pen tip.  This could lie within the mid esophagus
 or in the immediately surrounding soft tissues.  Compared with ___, this radiopacity is new
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette itself is within normal limits.  No CHF, focal
 infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  The extreme right
 costophrenic angle is excluded from the AP view, but there is no evidence of
 effusion on the lateral view.
 
 Minimal degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine, including possible
 minimal anterior wedging of a lower thoracic vertebral body, question T9.  The
 appearance is unchanged compared with ___.
 
 At the anteroinferior edge of the lateral view, metallic densities are seen
 projecting over the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 0.6 mm metallic density in the mid mediastinum is compatible with a pen tip
 and could lie within the mid-esophagus or possibly in the immediately
 surrounding soft tissues.  No pneumomediastinum identified.
 
 Minimal T-spine degenerative change, with possible minimal anterior wedging of
 a mid thoracic vertebral body that does not appear acute.
 
 Metallic densities noted projecting over the upper abdomen.  Please see
 separate report of abdomen films obtained same day.
