 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with ventilator-associated pneumonia.  Check ET tube

 increased right pleural effusion.  Although heart is normal size, vascular
 congestion suggests mild cardiac decompensation.  Opacification in the left
 lower lobe has been present since at least ___, without appreciable change. 
 No pneumothorax.  ET tube in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube passes
