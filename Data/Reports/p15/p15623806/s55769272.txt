                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Recent embolic stroke with intermittent chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The orientation of the AP film is lordotic.  A nasogastric tube
 courses into the stomach, its distal course not visualized.  The heart is at
 the upper limits of normal size with a left ventricular configuration.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is new patchy
 opacification in the superior segment of the right lower lobe and also patchy
 new lingular opacification.  On the lateral view only are vague posterior
 opacities that are hard to assess on the frontal view, but are probably within
 the left lower lobe in the retrocardiac region.  On the prior CT there was
 substantial opacification in both posterior lower lobes, particularly the
 left; the posterior left lower lobe finding may be due to residual atelectasis
 or scarring, probably unchanged since the most recent of the prior radiographs
 from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy new opacities in the right mid and left lower lungs, more
 suggestive of atelectasis than pneumonia.  However, it may be appropriate to
 perform short-term follow-up radiograph to show that these resolved,
 particularly if there is any clinical concern for the possibility of
 pneumonia.
