 the bilateral pleural effusions is constant.  The atelectatic lung areas in
 the retrocardiac lung regions are minimally smaller than before.  No new
 parenchymal opacities.  Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.  No
 evidence of pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.  The right internal jugular vein
 catheter as well as the alignment of the sternal wires and the post-CABG clips
 are constant in appearance.
