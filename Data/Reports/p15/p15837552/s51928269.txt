                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart
 failure (EF=___%), and a fib s/p CABG who presents with worsening lower
 extremity edema and DOE much improved, but with persistent cough, wheezes and
 rhonchi on lung exam.  Evaluate for interval change. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, ___, ___, ___ and ___. 
 
 Technique:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left pectoral pacemaker with single lead terminating in the right ventricle
 is unchanged.  The patient is status post median sternotomy with multiple
 intact appearing wires.  Mediastinal surgical clips are compatible with prior
 CABG surgery.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged but stable.  The right
 mediastinal contour is prominent in part related to unfolding of the thoracic
 aorta, which is unchanged.  There is calcification of the aortic knob.  There
 is decreased engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature and improved
 ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs suggesting resolving CHF.  No
 significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Resolving mild CHF.
