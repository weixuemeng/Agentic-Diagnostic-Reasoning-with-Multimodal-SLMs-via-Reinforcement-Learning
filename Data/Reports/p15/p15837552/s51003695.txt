 in the right ventricle.  The heart size is large, slightly increased from
 prior exam.  There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and scattered
 areas of ground-glass opacity in the lung, compatible with edema.  A few
 thickened septal lines are present.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
