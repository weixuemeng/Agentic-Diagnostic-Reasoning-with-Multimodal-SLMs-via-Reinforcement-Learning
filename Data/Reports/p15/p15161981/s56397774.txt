                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  HX SARCOID IN BONES
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change.
 Hyperexpansion of the lungs suggests some underlying chronic pulmonary
 disease. However, no acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural
 effusion. Specifically, no hilar or mediastinal adenopathy or prominence of
 interstitial markings to radiographically suggest sarcoidosis in the chest.
