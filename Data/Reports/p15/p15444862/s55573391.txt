                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic ovarian cancer with shortness of breath.  Assess for
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right PICC is in unchanged, satisfactory position.  Loculated left and
 dependent right pleural effusions are unchanged with fissural right-sided
 fluid likely again present.  Lung volumes have decreased from the previous
 examination.  Right mid and lower lung and left retrocardiac opacities appear
 stable to mildly increased though these could easily ___ or mask an
 infectious process.  Mild pulmonary edema may also present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged loculated and dependent pleural effusions with bibasilar and mid
 lung opacities which are perhaps minimally increased.  While mild pulmonary
 edema may be present, a concomitant infectious process is difficult to
 exclude.
