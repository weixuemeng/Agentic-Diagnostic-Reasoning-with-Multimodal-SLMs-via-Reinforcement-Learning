 ovarian cancer.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, CT torso, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is better seen in
 prior CT.  Right lower lobe opacities have increased.  This could be due to
 atelectasis and/or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is
 mild increase in loculated left pleural effusion.  Small right pleural
 effusion is new.  Right middle lobe consolidation is new.  There are increased
 opacities in the left lower lobe, a combination of atelectasis and pleural
 effusion.
