                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with left pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from ___, and
 ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest were obtained.  Right middle
 lobe pleural effusion, seen as a round opacity contiguous with the minor
 fissure, has significantly increased in size since previous imaging.  The
 previously seen left lower lobe opacity, which likely represents a loculated
 pleural effusion, has also increased in size since previous imaging. 
 Bibasilar pleural effusions are seen.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increase in size of right middle lobe pleural effusion and left
 lower lobe loculated pleural effusion since prior imaging.
