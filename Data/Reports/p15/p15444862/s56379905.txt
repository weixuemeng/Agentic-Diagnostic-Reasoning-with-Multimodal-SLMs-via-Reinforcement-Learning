                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of ovarian cancer
 metastatic to the lungs presenting with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Evidence of
 bilateral pleural effusions again seen, appears increased as compared to the
 prior study.  There are also increase in bilateral pulmonary opacities which
 may relate to metastatic disease, although underlying acute inflammation or
 infection also possible.  The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess due to
 bibasilar opacities.  Mediastinum is stable.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased bilateral pulmonary opacities likely in part due to
 increase in bilateral pleural effusions.  Increased parenchymal appearing
 opacities bilaterally may be due to worsening metastatic disease.  However,
 acute inflammatory or infectious process not excluded.
