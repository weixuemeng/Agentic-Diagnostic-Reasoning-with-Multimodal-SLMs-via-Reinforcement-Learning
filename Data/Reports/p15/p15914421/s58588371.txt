                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.  Rule out acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the chest from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Basilar opacities that are similar to
 the prior exam and likely reflects chronic interstitial changes seen on the
 recent CT.  Superinfection is difficult to exclude.  The linear opacity in the
 left mid base is more prominent, and likely represents atelectasis.  The
 apices of the lungs are clear.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  A left-sided
 Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position with the tip in the upper right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Basilar opacities likely represent the known interstitial disease
 seen on the recent CT.  Superinfection is difficult to completely exclude. 
 Recommend clinical correlation.
