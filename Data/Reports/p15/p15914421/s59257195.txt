                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CTA chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath is re- demonstrated with tip in the proximal right
 atrium, unchanged.  Lung volumes remain low with moderate enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette appearing unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present though no
 overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Linear opacities in the right upper lobe are
 compatible with post radiation changes.  Patchy and linear opacities in the
 lung bases likely reflect a combination of chronic interstitial lung disease
 and atelectasis.  No new focal consolidation is present.  Elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm is again noted, and a subpulmonic effusion may be present.
 There is no new pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is visualized.  Clips are seen in the right axilla, and the
 patient is status post bilateral breast reconstruction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with linear and patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflecting
 a combination of chronic interstitial lung disease and atelectasis.  Post
 radiation changes in the right upper lobe, unchanged.Probable right
 subpulmonic effusion accounting for the right hemidiaphragmatic elevation.
