                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph as well as older radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Cardiomediastinal contours are accentuated
 by low lung volumes, but appears stable.  Coarse reticular opacities are
 present at both lung bases, and have been present since at least ___
 and are not definitively seen on more remote radiograph of ___. 
 Additionally, a slightly more confluent opacity is present peripherally in the
 left lower lobe and has worsened since the prior chest radiograph of ___.  There are no pleural effusions.  Nonspecific scarring in the right
 apex is unchanged.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position. 
 Postoperative changes are seen within the breast.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic bibasilar reticular opacities, concerning for a fibrotic
 interstitial process from drug toxicity or a chronic progressive idiopathic
 interstitial pneumonia.  A more focal, peripheral left lower lobe opacity is
 also worse compared to ___.  
 
 Consider high-resolution CT for more complete characterization of these
 findings.
