                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Bibasilar opacities are present, which may correspond to the
 patient's previous diagnosis of NSIP, however superimposed infection cannot be
 completely excluded.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  There has been
 slight interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, which may represent
 enlarging pericardial effusion, or actual worsening cardiomegaly.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
