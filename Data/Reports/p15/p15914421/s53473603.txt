                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with left Port-A-Cath and
 swelling of the arm.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the level of the cavoatrial
 junction.  Compared to the prior study, there is no change in the position of
 the Port-A-Cath catheter that follows the expected course of the left
 brachiocephalic vein, SVC and cavoatrial junction.  Heart size and mediastinum
 are stable.  Bibasilar opacities are present, involving lung bases,
 substantially more pronounced than on the prior study and might potentially
 reflect areas of infection in the proper clinical setup.  Atelectasis or
 post-radiation changes would be another possibility.  Surgical sutures
 projecting over the left mid lung might be related to prior left breast
 surgery.  No appreciable pleural effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.
