 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chf and basilar infiltrates at end of
 ___.? ILD  // Have infiltrates cleared/improved
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart is enlarged but decreased in size compared to ___ chest
 radiograph.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present without overt
 pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  Bibasilar areas of atelectasis have
 nearly resolved in the interval.  Right hemidiaphragm remains moderately
 elevated.

 Resolving bibasilar opacities are most likely due to atelectasis. If there is
 strong clinical suspicion for interstitial lung disease, a high-resolution
 chest CT may be considered.
