                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with PICC line placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous studies for comparison.
 
 There is a right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip is in the right atrium. 
 This could be pulled back 3-4 cm for remarkable placement.  The side port of
 nasogastric tube is below the gastroesophageal junction.  The tip of the
 endotracheal tube is 3 cm above the carina.  There is increase in pulmonary
 interstitial markings suggestive of pulmonary vascular edema.  There are more
 confluent opacities within the left mid and lower lung fields, which may
 represent asymmetric pulmonary edema or developing consolidation.
