                                 FINAL REPORT
 FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Sepsis, intubated patient, tachycardic.
 
 Comparison is made to the prior study ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There has been interval increase in
 size in mild-to-large bilateral pleural effusions, largely on the left side. 
 There has been interval increase in bibasilar atelectasis, larger on the left
 side.  Lines and tubes are in standard position, though the NG tube is still
 coiled in the stomach and its tip is at the EG junction.
