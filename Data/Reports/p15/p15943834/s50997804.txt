                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference chest radiograph ___ at 9:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is severely enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion, slightly improved compared to the prior study. 
 Streaky opacity in the retrocardiac region likely reflects atelectasis. 
 Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles on the lateral view suggests the
 presence of trace bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion and possible trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.
