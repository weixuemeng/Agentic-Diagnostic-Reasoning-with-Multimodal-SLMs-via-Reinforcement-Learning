                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views were obtained of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are low in volume which gives an appearance of
 bronchovascular crowding.  Despite this, an increase in pulmonary markings
 could reflect mild pulmonary edema.  Linear opacities in the left lower lobe
 may reflect linear atelectasis without definite findings of pneumonia.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Heart size is top normal. 
 Marked upper mediastinal widening is due to chronic adenopathy and thymic
 enlargement, documented on Chest CTA ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes limiting assessment with perhaps mild pulmonary
 edema and linear left lower lobe atelectasis.  If continued clinical concern,
 consider repeat radiographs with a larger inspiration.
