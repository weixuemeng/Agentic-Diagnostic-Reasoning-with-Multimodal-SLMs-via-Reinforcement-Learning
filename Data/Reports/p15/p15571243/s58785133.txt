                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia hx b/l PE  // eval for PE, PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Outside CT of the chest ___ pre
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Known right hilar mass is re- demonstrated.  There are faintly visualized
 right bronchial stents.  There is increasing thickening of the lateral pleura
 in the right mid lung, likely pleural fluid.  There is worsening right pleural
 effusion and probable associated atelectasis.  Atelectasis at the left base is
 mild.  The heart is obscured along its right border limiting evaluation. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Known nodules in the left lung are better seen on
 prior chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Re- demonstrated known right hilar mass.
 2. Enlarging moderate right pleural effusion.  No convincing evidence of
 pneumonia, however right pleural effusion could obscure a pneumonia if one is
 present.
 3. Known pulmonary nodules are better appreciated on prior chest CT.
