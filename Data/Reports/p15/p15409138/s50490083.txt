                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior CT chest from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant pain, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs appear
 clear bilaterally.  There is slight prominence of the right pulmonary hilum
 which when compared with the prior CT and chest x-ray is stable and likely
 reflects slightly prominent right hilar nodes.  Please note the overall
 appearance is stable.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest without signs of pneumonia or CHF.  Right hilar
 prominence is likely due to prominent reactive right hilar nodes, which were
 seen also on prior CT.
