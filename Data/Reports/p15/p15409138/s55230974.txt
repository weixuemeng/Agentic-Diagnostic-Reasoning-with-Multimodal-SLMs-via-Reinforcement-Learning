                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate chronic appearing opacities in
 the right lower lobe as well as elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  These
 findings are consistent with atelectasis/volume loss.  The left lung is
 essentially clear.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  There is
 tortuosity of the aorta.  In addition, a convex bulge of the left upper
 mediastinum is once again present, but this is due to vascular structures and
 aberrant subclavian artery as was seen on the recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
