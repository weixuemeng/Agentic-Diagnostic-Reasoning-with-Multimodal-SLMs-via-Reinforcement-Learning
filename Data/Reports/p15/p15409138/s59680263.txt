                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of fevers, productive cough.  Please evaluate for
 infiltrates.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiomediastinal contours are mildly exaggerated secondary to low lung
 volumes, otherwise are unremarkable.  New retrocardiac opacity may be due to
 pneumonia or atelectasis.  There is persistent blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New retrocardiac opacity may be due to pneumonia or atelectasis, given low
 lung volumes.
