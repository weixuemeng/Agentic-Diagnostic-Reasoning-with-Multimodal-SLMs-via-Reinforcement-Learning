                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive failure versus pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity
 of the aorta.  No evidence of vascular congestion.  This discordancy raises
 the possibility of cardiomyopathy.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or pleural effusion.
