                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p esophagectomy  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right apical pneumothorax is tiny if any. An upper thoracostomy tube is still
 in place. Postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal following
 esophagectomy and pull-up. Heart is mildly enlarged, exaggerated by very low
 lung volumes, and unchanged. Left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened. The
 upper lungs are grossly clear. Pleural effusions are probably small.
 
 An upper enteric drain descends in the midline to the level of the diaphragm. 
 Right internal jugular line ends in the upper SVC. Mediastinal drains in
 place. An epidural infusion catheter coursing over the spine should not be
 mistaken for a mediastinal drain.
