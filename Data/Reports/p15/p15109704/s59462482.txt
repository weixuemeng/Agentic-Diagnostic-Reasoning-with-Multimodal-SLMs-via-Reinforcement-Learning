                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, fatigue
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy, mediastinal clips, and mitral valve
 repair.  Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The aortic knob is calcified.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Lungs remain hyperinflated.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles on
 the lateral view posteriorly suggests trace bilateral pleural effusions,
 decreased in size from the prior exam.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity may
 reflect atelectasis, but infection is difficult to exclude.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decreased size of small bilateral pleural effusions.  Patchy retrocardiac
 opacity could reflect atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude.
