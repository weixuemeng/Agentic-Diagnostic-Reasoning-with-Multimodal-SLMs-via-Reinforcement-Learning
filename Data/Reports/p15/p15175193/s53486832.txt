                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with MS  // doboff placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Exam was obtained to assess for ___ tube placement, which was reportedly

 remarkable for shift in distribution of pulmonary edema to the upper and mid
 lungs possibly coexisting with infectious pneumonia.  Small left pleural
 effusion is apparently new.
