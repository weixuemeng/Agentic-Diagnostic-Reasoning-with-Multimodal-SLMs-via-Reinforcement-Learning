                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest with stent placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a somewhat
 better inspiration.  There are streaks of atelectasis bilaterally, especially
 on the right.  No definite joint effusion or vascular congestion.
 
 Although the bilateral basilar opacifications most likely reflect merely
 volume loss, some suggested coalescence posteriorly could reflect a region of
 consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting.
