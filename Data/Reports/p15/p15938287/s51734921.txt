                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with L sided chest pain  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, which can be seen with chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  There appears to be blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle on the lateral view which could be due to pleural thickening or trace
 pleural effusion.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs.  Apparent blunting of the left costophrenic angle, most
 noted on the lateral view, may be due to pleural thickening versus a trace
 pleural effusion.
