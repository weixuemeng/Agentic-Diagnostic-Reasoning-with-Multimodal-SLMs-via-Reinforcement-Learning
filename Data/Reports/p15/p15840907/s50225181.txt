                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for cause of chest
 pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 3:40 a.m.
 
 FRONTAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette is again noted to be
 markedly enlarged but unchanged from approximately four hours prior.  Again,
 this is consistent with an underlying pericardial effusion.  Further
 obscuration of the pulmonary vascularity indicates development of mild
 pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed.  No
 pneumothorax.  Retrocardiac opacification is likely atelectasis, although
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Severe cardiomegaly, unchanged from four hours prior and worrisome for
 underlying pericardial effusion.
 2.  Interval development of mild pulmonary edema from ___.
