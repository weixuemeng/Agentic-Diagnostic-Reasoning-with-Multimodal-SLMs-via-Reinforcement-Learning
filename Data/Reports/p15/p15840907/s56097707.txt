                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of hypoxia, evaluate for
 fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 has been interval placement of a large-bore dual-lumen right central venous
 catheter, distal aspect not well seen, but likely terminating at the
 cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged.  There is a left base opacity, likely represents combination of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis.  There is a moderate pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left base opacity likely represents combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis although underlying consolidation cannot be entirely
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  The above findings with mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vascular congestion
 suggest fluid overload/CHF.
