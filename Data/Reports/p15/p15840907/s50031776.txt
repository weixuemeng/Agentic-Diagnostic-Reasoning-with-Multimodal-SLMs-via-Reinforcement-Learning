                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough, heart failure and elevated white count
 while on immunosuppression.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The central venous catheter from a right IJ approach tip is at the
 cavoatrial junction.  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is seen.  The lungs demonstrate improving consolidation of the
 retrocardiac space, either representing improving atelectasis or pneumonia. 
 Additionally, a new left upper lobe opacity is seen, concerning for a
 developing pneumonia.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Degenerative changes are seen in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left upper lobe opacity which may represent a developing
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Improving retrocardiac
 consolidation may represent improving atelectasis or pneumonia.
