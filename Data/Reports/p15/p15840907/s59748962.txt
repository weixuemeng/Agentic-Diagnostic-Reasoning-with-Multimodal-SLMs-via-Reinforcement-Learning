                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ESRD and CAD status post stenting with CHF and chest heaviness,
 dyspnea and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate moderate-to-severe
 cardiomegaly, similar in comparison with the prior AP radiograph, but
 increased since ___.  There is interval improvement in right lower
 lobe opacity since the prior study, however hazy opacification persists,
 difficult to discern whether new since the prior study or whether never fully
 resolved.  Infection vs assymetric pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette
 remains quite enlarged, which may be due to cardiomyopathy or pericardial
 effusion. Coronary artery calcification/stenting is seen. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in right lower lobe opacity since the prior
 study, however hazy opacification persists, difficult to discern whether new
 since the prior study or whether never fully resolved.  Infection vs
 assymetric pulmonary edema. Recommend follow-up to resolution and consider
 chest CT to exclude an underlying lesion as was also suggested on prior chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 Cardiac silhouette remains quite enlarged, which may be due to cardiomyopathy
 or pericardial effusion.
