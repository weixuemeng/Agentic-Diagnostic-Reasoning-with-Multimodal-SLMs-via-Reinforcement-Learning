                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis, to assess for effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is slightly increased
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which could reflect some increase in
 pleural effusion.  However, the images are difficult to correlate because of
 the change in patient position between them.
 
 Large right upper zone mass is again seen.
