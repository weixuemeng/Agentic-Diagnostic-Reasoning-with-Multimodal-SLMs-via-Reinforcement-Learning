                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of lung cancer and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again seen
 is large rounded opacity projecting over the right upper lobe consistent with
 patient's pulmonary mass.  Right base opacity could be likely pleural effusion
 and overlying atelectasis has increased since the prior study.  The elevated
 right hemidiaphragm is slightly increased as compared to the prior study. 
 Left lung is clear.  There is no left pleural effusion.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable.
