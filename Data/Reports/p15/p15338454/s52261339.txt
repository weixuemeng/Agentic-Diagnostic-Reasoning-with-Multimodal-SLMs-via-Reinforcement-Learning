 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post renal transplant, mild shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval removal of left-sided internal jugular central venous catheter. 
 The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable. 
 Slight prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature may be due to pulmonary
 vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
