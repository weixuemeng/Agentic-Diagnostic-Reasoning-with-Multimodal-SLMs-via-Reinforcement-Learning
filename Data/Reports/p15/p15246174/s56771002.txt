  ETT 1.8 cm above carina, rec withdrawal by ~ 2 cm.
  on prior OSH CXR, ETT terminated in right mainstem bronchus.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of intracranial
 hemorrhage, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 No prior study is available for comparison.  Reference made to outside
 hospital radiographs from ___ performed earlier the same
 date, ___ at 17:42.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 1.8 cm above the level of
 the carina; recommend withdrawal by approximately 2 cm.  Nasogastric tube is
 seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, distal aspect not included on
 the image.  Patchy left infrahilar opacity is seen, more confluent compared to
 the prior study which could relate to underlying aspiration.  The right lung
 is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  No evidence
 of displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 1.8 cm below the level of the
 carina, recommend withdrawal by approximately 2 cm for more optimal
 positioning.
 2.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, distal
 aspect not included on the image.
 3.  Left infrahilar and left retrocardiac patchy opacity not well defined on
 the prior study earlier this same date, query aspiration.
