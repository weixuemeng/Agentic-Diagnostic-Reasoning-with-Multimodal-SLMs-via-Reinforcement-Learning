                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, malaise.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia and
 reevaluate right upper lobe lesion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___
 and PET-CT performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate stable
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours with a prominent pericardial fat pad,
 causing increased opacification projecting over the left lower lung.  Due to
 increased right upper lobe volume loss, the previously identified right upper
 lobe density has become elevated and obscured by overlying rib.  In addition,
 the lesion is less dense and with a siggestion of crescentric lucency along
 the superolateral aspect, possibly representing cavitation.  There is a new
 vague opacification within the right lower lung which may represent early
 infectious process. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. No new pulmonary nodule identified.  Right upper lobe volume loss with
 decreased density of known right upper lobe nodule possibly due to cavitation.
 Recommend chest CT to further evaluate if warranted clinically.
 2. Focal left lower lobe opacification may represent early infection.
 
 ___ placed findings on critical communications dashboard at 3:44pm on
 ___.
