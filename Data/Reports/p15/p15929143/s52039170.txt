 for pre-op
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 There is no lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Allowing
 for low lung volumes and AP projection, heart size is top-normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Standard PA and lateral views of the chest would be helpful
 for more complete assessment of the heart and lungs the patient's condition
 permits.
