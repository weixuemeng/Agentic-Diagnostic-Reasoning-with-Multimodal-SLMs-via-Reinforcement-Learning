                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with IV drug abuse and leukocytosis.  Evaluate
 for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  On the lateral view, there is a focal
 opacity overlying the minor fissure, as well as a spine sign likely from a
 vague retrocardiac opacity seen on the PA view.  Otherwise, cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Constellation of findings raise concern for pneumonia.
