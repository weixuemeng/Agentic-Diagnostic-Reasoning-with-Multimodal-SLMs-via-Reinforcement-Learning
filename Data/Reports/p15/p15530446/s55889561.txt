                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post MVC a week ago with declining mental
 status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are well
 expanded, but clear of focal consolidation or pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 There is blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles, potentially due to
 small effusions or atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  The descending thoracic aorta is tortuous.  There is severe
 compression deformity of two mid thoracic vertebral bodies which are
 age-indeterminate.  Peripherally calcified lesion seen in the left upper
 quadrant, potentially within the spleen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Severe mid compression deformities in the mid thoracic spine which are age
 indeterminant and clinical correlation is suggested.
 2.  Peripherally calcified lesion in the left upper quadrant measuring
 approximately 7.5 x 4.9 cm, potentially within the spleen.  
 3.  Otherwise, unremarkable chest x-ray.
