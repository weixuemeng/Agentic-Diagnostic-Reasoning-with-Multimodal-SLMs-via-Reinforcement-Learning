                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 943
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage
 status post fall, elevated white count, evaluate for pneumonia.  No comparison
 studies.
 
 Please note that comparison to old films can be helpful to detect subtle
 interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The film was acquired with a somewhat lordotic technique.  Therefore, it
 is felt that the cardiomediastinal contours are likely upper limits of normal
 given technique, although the heart does have a somewhat globular appearance
 which could sugggest mild cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion should
 also be considered.  The lung volumes are low with streaky opacities at both
 bases likely reflecting bibasilar atelectasis, although an early infectious
 process cannot be excluded.  Followup imaging would be advised.  No
 pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusions. 
 No acute bony abnormality appreciated.
