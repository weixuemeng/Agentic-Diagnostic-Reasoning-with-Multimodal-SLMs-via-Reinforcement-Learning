                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post tracheobronchoplasty.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular venous catheter terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Streaky left mid to lower lung opacities appear
 unchanged and suggest minor atelectasis.  The right hemidiaphragm is
 persistently elevated with blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus.  The
 only clear change is some improvement in aeration of the right upper lobe. 
 There is air-fluid level projecting along the right lateral and posterior
 parts of the outer chest, but decreased on the posterolateral view, which
 could be seen with redistribution of the fluid or some differences in
 orientation between the radiographs.  However, the total extent of air and
 fluid is not necessarily changed.  A displaced right fourth rib fracture and a
 non-displaced right fifth rib fracture are noted.
