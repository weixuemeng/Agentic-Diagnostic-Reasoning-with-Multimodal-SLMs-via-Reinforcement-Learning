  Worsening right lung consolidation, likely pneumonia.  Lower lung volumes with

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a recent tracheobronchoplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 There has been little change in the chest over the past 60 hours, specifically
 the severe chronic cardiomegaly, small right pleural effusion and the
 loculated right pleural or extrapleural fluid collection.  More significantly
 is the large region of opacification projecting over the right mid lung
 laterally which could be fissural pleural fluid or region of consolidation in
 the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, undiagnosible from conventional
 chest radiographs.  Lateral view shows the remnants of subcutaneous emphysema
 and fluid in the soft tissue of the back.  Although this is decreasing, it
 could be a substantial collection in the soft tissues which should be
 monitored, at least clinically if not radiographically with CT scanning.
 
 Right jugular line ends in the low SVC or upper right atrium.  Lumen of the
 right bronchus is partially obscured by mediastinum, and could be filled with
 retained secretions.
