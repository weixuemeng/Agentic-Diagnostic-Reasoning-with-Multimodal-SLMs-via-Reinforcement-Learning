  Extremely low lung volumes, limiting evaluation.  Linear streaky  bilateral
  opacities are likely atelectasis.  Heart size is exaggerated by low lung
  volumes, but likely mildly enlarged, and stable.  Outline of stent present
  with distal tip in low trachea just above the carina.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stent.
 
 FINDINGS:  The stent is difficult to see, though the tip appears to be in the
 lower portion of the trachea just above the carina.  There are extremely low
 lung volumes with extensive atelectatic changes in the right mid zone. 
 Retrocardiac atelectasis is also seen.  The apparent increase in the
 transverse diameter of the heart most likely reflects the low lung volumes.
