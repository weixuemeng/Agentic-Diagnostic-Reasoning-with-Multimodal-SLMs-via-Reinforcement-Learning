                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post bronchotracheoplasty.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 CHETS, 2 VWS
 
 Compared to ___, the appearance is quite similar.  Compared to ___,
 plate-like atelectasis or thickening along the right minor fissure and
 plate-like atelectasis at the left base have reappeared.  Some ill-defined
 opacity in the right mid zone is more apparent compared with ___, due to
 differences in technique.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is
 unchanged.  There is upper zone redistribution, without definite CHF. 
 
 Again seen is a relatively large focus of subcutaneous emphysema, possibly
 with an air-fluid level, in the soft tissues posterior to the lower chest,
 similar to the prior studies -- ?  prominent subcutaneous fluid collection. 
 Clinical correlation requested.
