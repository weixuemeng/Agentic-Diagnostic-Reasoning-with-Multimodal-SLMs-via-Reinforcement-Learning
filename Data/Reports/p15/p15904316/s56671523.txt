                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with back pain s/p endoscopy  // acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion is with likely overlying right base atelectasis. 
 Right base opacity most likely due to atelectasis although small area of
 consolidation is difficult to exclude.  The left lung is clear.  There is no
 left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  No pneumomediastinum is seen or evidence of free air
 beneath the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Right base opacity
 likely represents combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, although
 subtle consolidation is difficult to exclude.
 
 No pneumomediastinum or evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
