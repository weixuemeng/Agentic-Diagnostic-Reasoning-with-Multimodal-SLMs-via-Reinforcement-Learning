                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Head and shoulder injury status post fall from bike.  Possible
 syncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is borderline in size.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are otherwise unremarkable aside from aortic calcification.  There is a patchy
 opacity obscuring the left lung base, probably due to atelectasis, although
 not entirely specific.  It is possible that there may be a very small
 coinciding pleural effusion on the left only.  None is suspected on the right.
 No fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of injury or acute cardiopulmonary disease.
