                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Optic neuritis, question infectious nodules or infiltrates.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.  No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 
 There is subtle nonspecific crowding of infrahilar vessels in the right
 cardiophrenic region, of uncertain significance.  ? normal variation, trace
 atelectasis, or subtle early infiltrate.  The lungs are otherwise clear,
 without focal infiltrate consolidation, effusion, CHF, or pneumothorax.  The
 heart is not enlarged. Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar
 or mediastinal lymphadenopathy or pulmonary nodules are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Chest x-ray examination essentially normal.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, subtle crowding of bronchovascular markings in the right
 cardiophrenic region could represent a very subtle infiltrate.
