 Please assess for NGT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:00 under clip ___FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, radiopaque Dobbhoff type tube tip is no longer
 visualized.
 
 A new NG J tube is present.  The tube is coiled over the expected site of the
 gastric fundus such that its distal tip points cephalad and overlies the lower
 mediastinum, likely in the lower esophagus.
 
 The right hemidiaphragm is elevated, with minimal atelectasis and/or scarring,
 similar to prior.  Again seen is patchy opacity at the left lung base. 
 Inspiratory volumes are low.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New NG tube tip appears to be coiled in the fundus, with tip now overlying the
 lower esophagus.  This should be repositioned.
