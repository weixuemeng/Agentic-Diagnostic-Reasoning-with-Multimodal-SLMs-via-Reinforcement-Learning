                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with with stroke please assess for NGT placement 
 // Please assess for NGT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, the radiopaque tip of the Dobbhoff type tube has
 retracted and now lies in the region of the GE junction.  The proximal portion
 of the radiopaque segment probably lies proximal to the GE junction, within
 the lowermost esophagus.
 
 Otherwise, allowing for differences in positioning, I doubt significant
 interval change.  Subtle bibasilar opacities remain visible.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retraction of Dobbhoff type tube, detailed above.  The radiopaque tip likely
 straddles the GE junction.
