                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with intracranial hemorrhage, now intubated. 
 Evaluate ETT.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The newly placed ETT tip is in standard position.  An enteric tube is
 incompletely imaged but traverses the diaphragm into the left upper quadrant,
 beyond the field of view.  Linear atelectasis is present in the left
 infrahilar region.  Lung volumes have slightly improved.  Increased opacity in
 the right infrahilar region could reflect aspiration.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No edema.  Heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ETT in standard position.
 2.  Increased opacity in the right infrahilar region could reflect aspiration
 versus developing pneumonia.
