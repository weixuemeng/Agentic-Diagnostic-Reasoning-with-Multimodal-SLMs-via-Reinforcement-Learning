 superimposed consolidation, pneumothorax, or effusion is detected.  The heart
 size remains normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours remain within normal
 limits.  Mild atherosclerotic calcifications are seen throughout the thoracic
 aorta.
 
 There is a slight cobblestone appearance to the gastric mucosa, which could
 represent gastritis in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Chronic interstitial disease.  No superimposed consolidation detected.
 2.  Cobblestone appearance of the gastric mucosa is nonspecific, but could
 represent gastritis in the appropriate clinical setting.
