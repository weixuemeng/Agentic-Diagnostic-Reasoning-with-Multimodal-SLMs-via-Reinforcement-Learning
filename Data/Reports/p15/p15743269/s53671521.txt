                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophageal tear.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the degree of
 pneumoperitoneum appears to be worsening.  Small pneumothoraces persist
 bilaterally.  Opacification at both bases is consistent with atelectasis with
 probable left effusion as well.  Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels
 suggests some elevated pulmonary venous pressure, possibly related to
 overhydration.
