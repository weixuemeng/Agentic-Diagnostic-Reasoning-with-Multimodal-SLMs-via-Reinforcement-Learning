                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophageal perforation with mediastinitis and pneumoperitoneum.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again
 evidence of substantial pneumoperitoneum with small bilateral pneumothoraces
 that may be less prominent than on the previous examination.  Continued
 pneumomediastinum.  Opacification at the left base is consistent with
 atelectasis and effusion.
