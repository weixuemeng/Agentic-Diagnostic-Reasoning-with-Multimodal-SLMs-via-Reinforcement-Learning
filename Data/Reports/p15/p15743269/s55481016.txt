                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with esophagitis after EGD,
 suspected perforation.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier.
 
 On the current radiograph, there is still presence of the pneumomediastinum
 and small amount of intraperitoneal air.  The NG tube tip is very high, at the
 level of the carina and should be advanced if clinically warranted.
