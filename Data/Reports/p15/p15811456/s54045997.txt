                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with neutropenic fever and pancytopenia,
 hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, colon cancer status post liver biopsy
 yesterday.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well inflated.  Bibasilar atelectasis, greater on the
 left is grossly unchanged since prior studies.  A subtle increased peripheral
 opacity in the left lower lobe could be present.  Small bibasilar effusions
 are stable. No pneumothorax is present.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are unremarkable.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip is seen in the low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Grossly stable appearance of bibasilar atelectasis.  The presence
 of a small additional consolidation at the left base is difficult to entirely
 exclude, and depends on clinical context.
