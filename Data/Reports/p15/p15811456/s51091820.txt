                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Acute respiratory failure, recently discharged to rehab,
 please evaluate left central venous line tip location and interval change in
 pulmonary abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is intubated, with the tip of endotracheal tube approximately 1.3
 cm above the carina.  Left-sided subclavian central venous catheter is
 present, with the tip in the lower SVC.  Left-sided PICC is present, the tip
 is difficult to visualize due to its superimposition over the left central
 venous catheter.  A right-sided implanted catheter is present, with the tip in
 the region of the cavoatrial junction.  A feeding tube is present, extending
 into the stomach, and extending beyond the inferior confines of this
 examination.
 
 Again seen is a diffuse opacification in the right and left hemithoraces,
 within predominantly alveolar pattern, but with some reticulation seen at the
 lung bases, this may represent a combination of alveolar edema and some degree
 of interstitial edema or lung disease at the bases.  No significant pleural
 effusion.  No new consolidation.  
 
 Overall, the degree of opacification of the lungs is similar to the prior
 examination allowing for differences in lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube approximately 1.3 cm above the carina, a relatively low
 location; suggest some degree of withdrawl.  Left central venous catheter
 appears to project over the mid SVC.  If further clarification is desired,
 lateral view may also be considered.
