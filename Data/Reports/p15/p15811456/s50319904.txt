 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with cirrhosis, worsening shortness of breath. 
 Followup after diuresis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Diffuse lung opacities have increased.  Previously noted abnormalities are due
 to infection though there is a component of mild pulmonary edema.  The
 consolidations have increased in the upper lobe mainly.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  There are low lung volumes.  The small bilateral
 pleural effusions are unchanged.  Right central catheter tip is in the lower
 SVC.
