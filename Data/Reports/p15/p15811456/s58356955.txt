                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with respiratory failure and worsening tachypnea. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA from ___ and radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium.  NG tube
 is seen with tip off the view of the film.  In comparison to the previous two
 radiographs, there is a a significant increase in right-sided opacities,
 previously worrisome for edema, but it should also be noted that this can be
 seen in an typical infection. The patient's underlying fibrosis made it
 conceivable that this is also a exacerbation of this condition.  A right-sided
 apical chest tube is in place.  Endotracheal tube is in correct position. 
 Left lung is clear of any focal opacities concerning for infectious process.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increase in the opacities on the right side since the prior two
 radiographs, most concerning for asymmetric edema, less likely infection.
 Underlying fibrosis is also present.
