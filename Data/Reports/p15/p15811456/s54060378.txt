                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with respiratory failure, pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 5:33 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube ends 4 cm above carina.  Left jugular line ends in mid SVC
 and right-sided Port-A-Cath ends at cavoatrial junction.  Left PICC line is in
 upper atrium.  Feeding tube is unchanged.  Right small apical pneumothorax
 measuring 1 cm is stable since this morning, but new since yesterday.  Mild
 pulmonary edema has improved, but residual abnormalities of ARDS, widespread
 ground-glass opacity, reticulation and low lung volumes, are unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tube and lines are in adequate position.
 2.  Small right apical pneumothorax is stable.
 3.  Improved, transient pulmonary edema.
