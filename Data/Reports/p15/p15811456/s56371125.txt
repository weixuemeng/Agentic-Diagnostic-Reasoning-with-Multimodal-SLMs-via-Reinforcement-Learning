                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cirrhosis,
 presenting with worsening shortness of breath, evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles
 may be due to trace pleural effusions.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are stable.  There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath terminating in the distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities, given history, consistent
 with significant fluid overload; suggest repeat radiograph after diuresis to
 further evaluate for additional underlying process.  Trace bilateral pleural
 effusions.
