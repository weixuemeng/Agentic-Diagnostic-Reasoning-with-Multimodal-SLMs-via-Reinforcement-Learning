                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT SEMI-ERECT CHEST RADIOGRAPH ON ___ AT 5:30
 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Evaluate interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable chest radiograph was performed with comparison to
 the examination from one day previous.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is interval development of a right apical pneumothorax, measuring
 approximately 1.8 cm on maximum measurement.  The right hemithorax remains
 relatively well aerated, but with diffuse alveolar opacities, similar in
 extent and degree to the prior examination.  There appears to be slight
 increased volume loss in the left retrocardiac region, which may represent
 slight worsening atelectasis, although the possibility of a worsening alveolar
 process cannot be excluded.   The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.
 
 Endotracheal tube remains in place, with the tip approximately 4 cm above the
 carina.  Left-sided subclavian central venous catheter is again seen, with the
 tip at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.  Right-sided implanted
 catheter is present with the tip at the cavoatrial atrial junction.  A feeding
 tube remains in place, NG type, extending beyond the inferior confines of this
 film.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval development of right apical pneumothorax.  
 
 This was called by telephone to Dr. ___ at 11:55 a.m., ___,
 within five minutes after discovery of the finding.
