                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 HISTORY:  Pleuritic chest pain and EKG findings concerning for pericarditis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged with leads again
 terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  Allowing for low lung volumes, there is no definite change,
 however, although it is difficult to exclude a small pericardial effusion. 
 There is no definite pleural effusion.  Streaky basilar opacities suggest
 minor atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Flowing anterior osteophytes
 along the thoracic spine suggest hyperostosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy basilar opacities suggesting minor atelectasis in the
 setting of low lung volumes.  No definite change in the size of the cardiac
 shadow allowing for differences in technique, although it is hard to exclude a
 small pericardial effusion.
