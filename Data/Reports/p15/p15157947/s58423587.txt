                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___ and CT of the chest dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes
 which result in bronchovascular crowding.  The known right hilar mass and
 peripheral opacities are better characterized on recent CT of the chest, but
 do not appear grossly changed.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or focal consolidation.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
