                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Wheezes on exam, relative leukocytosis, questionable infectious
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  The position and shape of the
 hemidiaphragms is unremarkable.  On the lateral radiograph, along the major
 fissures, minimal fissural thickening is seen, indicative of past pleural
 reactions without the presence of pleural effusions.  In addition, the left
 lower lobe shows mild peribronchial thickening, potentially suggestive of
 bronchitis.  However, no circumscribed parenchymal opacity suggesting recent
 pneumonia is seen.  Normal size and shape of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal
 appearance of the hilar and mediastinal structures.  No pneumothorax.  No lung
 nodules or masses.
