                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Dobbhoff tube position assessment.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day
 at 6:42 p.m.
 
 The Dobbhoff tube remains in the distal esophagus and should be re-positioned.
 Right basal opacity is unchanged, cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged
 and minimal basal atelectasis on the left is unchanged as well.
