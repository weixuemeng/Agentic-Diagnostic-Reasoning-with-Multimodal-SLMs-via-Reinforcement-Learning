                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post assault after being kicked in the right lower rib cage,
 here to evaluate for rib fracture.  
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.  
 
 Technique:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No displaced rib fractures are detected on the frontal view; however, if there
 is clinical concern, a dedicated rib series could be obtained.  Coarse
 reticulation is noted at the lung bases and probably bronchiectasis.  No
 significant pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal consolidation is seen. 
 The cardiac silhouette is normal size and the final hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  There is no free air beneath the
 right hemi diaphragm.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No displaced rib fractures are detected on the frontal view; however, if
 there is clinical concern, a dedicated rib series could be obtained. 
 
 2.  Bibasilar coarse peripheral densities in the lungs suggesting substantial
 interstitial or airway disease, probably chronic, although no baseline is
 available. Correlation with clinical history is suggested.
