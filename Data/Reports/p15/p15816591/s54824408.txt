                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Streaky left basilar opacities are not specific, but more suggestive of
 atelectasis although potentially pneumonia.  The right costophrenic sulcus is
 indistinct, which is non-specific; minor scarring, trace pleural effusion or
 atelectasis could be considered.  Small to moderate anterior osteophytes are
 noted along the thoracic spine. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Non-specific retrocardiac opacification.  Atelectasis would
 explain the findings, but in the appropriate setting, pneumonia could be given
 consideration.
