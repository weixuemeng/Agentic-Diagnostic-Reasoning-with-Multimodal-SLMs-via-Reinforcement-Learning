 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with multiple myeloma being restaged for bone marrow
 transplant eligibility.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Appearance of the frontal chest radiograph is stable for more than a year,
 including moderate elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, although heart size
 previously mildly enlarged on ___ has returned to normal size. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal and the upper lungs are clear.  The only
 change found on the lateral view where there is a region of increased
 radiopacity projecting over the posterior aspect of the lower thoracic
 vertebral body seen through the distended stomach.  I would ascribe this
 abnormality to sclerosis in the vertebral body except that the distribution of
 abnormality in that region was different on ___, more anterior.  Raises
 the possibility of a focal lung lesion, more likely on the right than the
 left.  Question abnormality could be pertinent to the prospective bone marrow
 transplant.  As such, I would consider chest CT scanning for no other reason
 and to establish a baseline for any possible lung lesion.  Dr. ___ was paged.
 
 Note: subsequent Chest CT showed no significant lung or other intrathoracic
 abnormality. P ___
