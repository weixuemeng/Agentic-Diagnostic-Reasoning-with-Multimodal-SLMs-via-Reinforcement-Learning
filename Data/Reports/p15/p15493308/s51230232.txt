                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with multiple myeloma, being worked up
 for auto BMT eligibility testing.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  The heart size remains within normal limits.  The
 left-sided hemidiaphragm is moderately elevated, apparently related to a
 gas-distended left sided colonic flexure.  Similar elevation existed already
 on the preceding study.  Thoracic aorta and mediastinal structures are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There is no
 evidence of acute or chronic pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates and the lateral
 and posterior pleural sinuses remain free.  Skeletal structures of the thorax
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiovascular or pulmonary abnormalities. 
 Moderate elevation of left-sided hemidiaphragm similar as on previous
 examination.  Thus, no evidence of acute ongoing abnormalities.
