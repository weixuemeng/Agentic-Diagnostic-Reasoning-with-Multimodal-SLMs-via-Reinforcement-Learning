                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of two days earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of feeding tube, terminating below the
 diaphragm, with tip outside the field-of-view.  Left PICC remains in place. 
 Persistent cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and
 further improvement in extent of pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions
 also appear smaller, but positional differences limit comparison.
