                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 1:24 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with nasogastric tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 16:44.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ and 1:24 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval exchange of a feeding tube for a nasogastric tube with the tube
 seen coursing below the diaphragm but the tip not definitely identified due to
 technique and patient's body habitus.  A dedicated abdominal film to confirm
 the position of the nasogastric tube may be helpful prior to clinical use as
 it is not clear where the sideport lies.  Left subclavian PICC line remains in
 place.  Persistent bilateral layering effusions with interval worsening of
 bilateral airspace process likely reflecting worsening pulmonary edema.  There
 is likely bibasilar compressive atelectasis associated with the effusions. 
 Heart remains stably enlarged.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Results were
 communicated to the patient's nurse, ___, by phone on ___ at 10:20 a.m.
