                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  COPD, status post right thoracentesis.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL 
 
 The heart remains enlarged.  Bilateral pleural effusions are present.  No
 pneumothorax is seen, but the film is underpenetrated and some movement
 artifact is present.  Allowing for differences in technique, there has been
 little change since the prior chest x-ray.
