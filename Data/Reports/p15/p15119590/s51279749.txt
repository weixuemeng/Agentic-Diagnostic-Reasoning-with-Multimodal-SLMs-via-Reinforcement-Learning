 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:18 PM
  New endotracheal tube terminates 5.3 cm above the carina.  NG tube terminates
  below the diaphragm.  Pulmonary edema has worsened since the prior exam with
  increased bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.  An underlying
  infection cannot be excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:46 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Elderly woman after distal gastrectomy.  Intubated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 ET tube in standard placement, upper enteric tube traverses the esophagus into
 the upper abdomen and out of view.  Moderate right pleural effusion is new or
 substantially increased, layering posteriorly in what is I presume a nearly
 supine patient.  More pronounced leftward mediastinal shift could be due in
 part to the right pleural effusion but more likely worsening left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Pulmonary vasculature is more pronounced, but this may be due in
 part to supine positioning.  Nevertheless, given moderate cardiomegaly and
 very large pulmonary arteries, there is evidence of biventricular heart
 failure, although probably not pulmonary edema.  Small left pleural effusion
 is larger.  No pneumothorax.
