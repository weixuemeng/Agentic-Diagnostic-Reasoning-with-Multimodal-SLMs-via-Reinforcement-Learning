 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intubation, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated.  The right internal jugular vein catheter is in unchanged position.
 There is a minimally increased radiolucency at the lung bases, potentially
 reflecting improved ventilation.  Unchanged size and appearance of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No new parenchymal opacities.
