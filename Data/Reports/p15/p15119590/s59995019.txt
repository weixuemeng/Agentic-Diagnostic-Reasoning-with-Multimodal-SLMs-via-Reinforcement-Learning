                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:31 P.M., ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with COPD, renal disease and recurrent GI
 bleed.  Suspect volume overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 11:26 a.m.:
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion, mild pulmonary edema and small right pleural
 effusion have increased, as has consolidation in the left lower lung.  Since
 there is leftward shift of the cardiac silhouette, some of this is due to
 atelectasis but the change raises concern for developing pneumonia,
 accompanied by increasing small left pleural effusion.  Heart is moderately
 enlarged.  No pneumothorax.
