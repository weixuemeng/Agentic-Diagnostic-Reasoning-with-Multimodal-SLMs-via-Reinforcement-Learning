 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:30 PM
  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is increased
  opacity at the right lung base which could reflect a combination of
  atelectasis and pleural effusion, however an underlying infectious process
  cannot be entirely excluded.  Opacity at the left upper lung has improved,
  however opacity at the left lung base persists, likely a combination of
  pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Pulmonary edema persists.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with multiple comorbidities, persistent
 bleeding antral ulcer, now status post exploratory lap with worsening dyspnea,
 question pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 1:24.
 
 Portable AP upright chest from ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  There is stable mild pulmonary and interstitial edema.  Bibasilar
 air space opacities are now noted with at least an associated left effusion
 and likely a smaller right effusion.  These findings may be related to
 pulmonary edema, but also could reflect a partial lower lobe atelectasis or
 superimposed pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  Left subclavian PICC line is seen
 with its tip in the distal SVC.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing to at
 least the distal esophagus with the tip not definitely identified.  No
 pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given
 differences in positioning.
