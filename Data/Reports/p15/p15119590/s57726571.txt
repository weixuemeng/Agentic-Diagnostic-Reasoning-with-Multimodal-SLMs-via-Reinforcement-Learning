                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 6:12 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 6:02.
 
 Portable AP semierect chest film, ___ at 6:12 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 2.5 cm above the
 carina.  A right internal jugular catheter has its tip in the proximal SVC. 
 Increasing consolidation at the left base which is concerning for aspiration,
 pneumonia or worsening atelectasis in the setting of a layering effusion.  In
 addition, there is increasing indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature
 which suggests interval development of mild pulmonary edema.  Heart remains
 enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable. Right subclavian PICC line
 continues to have its tip in the proximal right atrium.  No large
 pneumothorax, although sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished
 given semi-supine technique.
