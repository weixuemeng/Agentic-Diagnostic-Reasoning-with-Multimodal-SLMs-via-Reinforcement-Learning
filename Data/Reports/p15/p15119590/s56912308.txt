 and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is stable cardiomegaly.  The
 right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the mid SVC.  The
 right-sided PICC line ends at the right atrium.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent opacification at the left base consistent with pleural
 effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
