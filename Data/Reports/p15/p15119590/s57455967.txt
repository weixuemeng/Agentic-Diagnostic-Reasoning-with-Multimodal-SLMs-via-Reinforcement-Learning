                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, ___ ___ A.M.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath.  Question fluid status.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph,
 ___:
 
 Pulmonary vascular re-distribution and small bilateral pleural effusions have
 increased.  Opacification in the right lower lobe could be atelectasis alone
 or consolidation.  There is no pulmonary edema in the upper lungs.  Heart is
 moderately enlarged, and pulmonary arteries somewhat dilated, which can
 reflect elevated left atrial pressure, even in the absence of pulmonary edema.
