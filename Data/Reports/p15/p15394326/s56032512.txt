                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea on exertion  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study, there has been a interval increase in bibasilar
 opacities as well as perihilar opacities and ___ B-lines compatible with
 heart failure. The cardiac silhouette, now moderate to severely enlarged, has
 increased since the prior study. Superimposed infection in the right lower
 lobe could be possible and followup radiograph after diuresis would help
 better evaluate this. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiac failure and mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
