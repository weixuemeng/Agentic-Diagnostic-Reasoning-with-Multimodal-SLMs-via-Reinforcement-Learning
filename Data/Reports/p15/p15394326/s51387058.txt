                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion  // eval
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to prior, the lung volumes have increased.  Diffuse bilateral
 pulmonary opacities have since resolved.  There is a small nodular opacity in
 the right lateral base, probably due to nodular atelectasis in the absence of
 a lung nodule in this region on recent CT of ___.  There is
 minimal residual left basal atelectasis.  There is new small right pleural
 effusion and minimal left pleural effusion, which is better seen on the
 lateral view. Cardiomegaly is stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  The right chest tube has been removed.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New small right pleural effusion.  Interval improvement of left pleural
 effusion and lung opacities.
 2. Nodular opacity in the right base, likely nodular atelectasis.  However,
 attention on follow-up chest radiograph is recommended to ensure resolution.
