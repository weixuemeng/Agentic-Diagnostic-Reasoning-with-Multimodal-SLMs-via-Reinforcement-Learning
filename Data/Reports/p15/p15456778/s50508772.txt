 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 15:28

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 On the sequential imaging, Dobbhoff feeding tube initially is seen projecting
 over the upper esophagus and subsequently within the right mainstem bronchus
 but on the final image, the tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip
 projecting over the stomach.  Chest wall deformity related to multiple
 bilateral old rib fractures is stable. Appearance of the lungs is unchanged
 with decreased aeration at the right base which presumably is chronic.  No
 pneumothorax.  No large effusions or pulmonary edema. Heart remains enlarged.
