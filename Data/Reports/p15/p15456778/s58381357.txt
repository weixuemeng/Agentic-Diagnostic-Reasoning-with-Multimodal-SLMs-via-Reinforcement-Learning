 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo M with severe COPD, HFpEF, a fib on Metop/Digoxin, obesity
 s/p laparoscopic band surgery presenting at OSH w/ Pseudomonal PNA in sputum
 and coag negative staph in blood - on appropriate coverage. // Assess lung

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left PICC line terminates in the right atrium, unchanged in overall
 position.  Tracheostomy tube appears midline accounting for patient rotation. 
 Severe right lower lung atelectasis with increased rightward shift of the
 heart persists. Small layering right pleural effusion is overall similar but
 perhaps minimally improved.  Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.  The heart
 size is normal.  No left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.  Old left rib
 fractures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Minimal decrease in right pleural effusion; otherwise no significant
 interval change - severe right lower lung atelectasis.
 2. Left PICC line still ends in right atrium, could pull back about 5 cm.
