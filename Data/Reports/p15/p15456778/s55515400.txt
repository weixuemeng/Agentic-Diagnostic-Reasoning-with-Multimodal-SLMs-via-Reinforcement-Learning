                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD, s/p 2 step  Dobhoff placement  // eval
 Dobhoff placement, 2 step process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The Dobbhoff catheter terminates in the stomach. Contrast from a recent
 contrast-enhanced study opacifies the partially imaged colon. Aeration at the
 right lung base remains poor, likely due to persistent right lower lobe
 atelectasis. The patient's chin obscures the lung apices, limiting evaluation
 for pneumothorax. The left lung is clear. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the
 projection is unchanged.  Old rib fractures and left scapular fractures are
 unchanged. The patient has had previous lap band placement.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Dobbhoff catheter terminates in the stomach. No other significant interval
 change.
