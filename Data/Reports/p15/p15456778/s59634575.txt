                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with A tach s/p ablation who remains intubated
 for airway trauma // eval for interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP view of the chest provided.
 
 As compared to prior study, there is interval resolution of pulmonary edema.
 Right lung base opacity is worse, likely due to pleural effusion with or
 without segmental atelectasis.  Severe cardiomegaly is stable.  Left costal
 pleural thickening and bilateral healed rib fractures are chronic.
 Endotracheal tube and right IJ line are in appropriate positions. Nasogastric
 tube courses towards the stomach and out of view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Worsened right lung opacity, likely secondary to pleural effusion +/-
 segmental atelectasis.
 2. Resolution of pulmonary edema.
