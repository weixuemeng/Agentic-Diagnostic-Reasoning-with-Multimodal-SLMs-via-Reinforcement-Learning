                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dizziness, not feeling well.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re-
 demonstrated.  The aorta remains tortuous.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Levoscoliosis of the
 thoracic spine is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
