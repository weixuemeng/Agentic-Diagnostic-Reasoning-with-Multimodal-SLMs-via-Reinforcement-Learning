                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lethargy, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is
 a large retrocardiac density containing an air-fluid level compatible with
 hiatal hernia.  The heart does appear to be mildly enlarged, though difficult
 to assess on the lateral view given the presence of the hiatal hernia.  No
 signs of pneumonia, aspiration, CHF, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal
 contour is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large hiatal hernia.  Mild cardiomegaly.
