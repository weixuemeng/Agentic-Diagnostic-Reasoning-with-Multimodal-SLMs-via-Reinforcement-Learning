                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute hepatitis.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The heart is normal in size and there is no
 vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.
 
 Of incidental note is substantial dilatation of gas-filled loops of bowel. 
 This could represent adynamic ileus, though in the appropriate clinical
 setting an obstruction would have to be considered.
