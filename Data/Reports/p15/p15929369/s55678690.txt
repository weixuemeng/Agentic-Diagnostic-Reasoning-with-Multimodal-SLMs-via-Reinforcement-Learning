  IMPRESSION:  Bulging contour in the aortopulmonary window, most likely due to
  enlargement of the main pulmonary artery or somewhat unusual course, but in
  order to exclude lymphadenopathy, chest CT is suggested when clinically
  appropriate, including with intravenous contrast administration if possible.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  "Not feeling well."
 
 COMPARISONS:  Recent portable study from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is a bulging contour in the
 aortopulmonary window that appears more prominent than on the prior study but
 probably the apparent difference is due to differences in technique.  This
 appearance could be seen with an enlarged main pulmonary artery, but when
 clinically appropriate, CT is suggested to exclude a mass lesion.  Concordant
 with this concern is slight apparent density projecting over the subcarinal
 region which is a finding that may reflect lymphadenopathy.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  Moderate
 osteophytes are noted along the mid-to-lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bulging contour in the aortopulmonary window, most likely due to

 Findings and recommendations discussed with Dr. ___ at 11:30 am on ___ by telephone.
