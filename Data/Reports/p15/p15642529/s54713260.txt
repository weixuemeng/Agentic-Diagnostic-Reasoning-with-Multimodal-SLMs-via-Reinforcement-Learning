                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  History of multifocal pneumonia at the crests decreased breath
 sounds of the left base.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a moderate to large pleural effusion on the left with opacification
 of the left lower lobe. A combination of pleural effusion and parenchymal
 opacification is more extensive than on the prior study, now involving the
 superior segment of the left lower lobe.  There is probably a trace pleural
 effusion only on the right.  Fissures are minimally thickened but there is no
 parenchymal edema.  The bones are probably demineralized.  Degenerative
 changes affect each shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantial pleural effusion on the left with either atelectasis or possibly
 pneumonia involving the left lower lobe. Whether this effusion represents a
 recurrent abnormality or a slowly persistent increasing one since the prior
 study is not certain.
