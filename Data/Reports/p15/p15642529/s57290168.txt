  Initial images demonstrate Dobbhoff tube in the mid esophagus however the
  second image demonstrates interval advancement of the Dobbhoff tube with the
  tip terminating in the proximal stomach. Additional advancement of the
  Dobbhoff tube is recommended. There has been no significant interval change in
  the appearance of multi focal consolidations, likely secondary to aspiration.
  Right-sided PICC line terminates in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax.

 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new Dobhoff placement.  // This is for a
 2-stage procedure to assess Dophoff placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single view at ___ 5:13 PM
 
 COMPARISON:   ___ at 15:10
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The examination is actually a series of 2 examinations. The the first
 examination demonstrates the Dobbhoff tube in the distal esophagus. A second
 examination demonstrates to be in the cardia of the stomach.  A right-sided
 PICC line remains in the azygos region.
 
 Bilateral parenchymal infiltrates are seen in the right upper lobe right lower
 lobe and left lower lobe. These have not changed. There probably are small
 effusions. Calcification of the thoracic aorta is present.  The heart is not
 enlarged.  The osseous structures are normal for age.  Monitor leads overlie
 the chest.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continued and unchanged multifocal pneumonia.
 
 The Dobbhoff tube ultimately terminates in the region of the gastric cardia.
