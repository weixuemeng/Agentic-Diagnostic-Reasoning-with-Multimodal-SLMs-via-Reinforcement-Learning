                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___-year-old man with line placed at OSH, assess line
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  There is no prior chest x-ray for comparison at the time of
 dictation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right internal jugular catheter has tip ending in upper
 SVC/origin of the SVC.  Lung volume is moderate withbibasilar atelectasis,
 larger to left than to the right.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is
 probably due to small pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal, with apparent
 enlargement of the vascular pedicle for mild pectus excavatum.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
