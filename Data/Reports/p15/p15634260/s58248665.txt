                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The tip of the endotracheal tube measures
 approximately 4 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube extends to the upper
 stomach where it crosses the lower margin of the image.  There is enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with intact midline sternal wires. 
 Poor definition of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the
 hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and
 probable small pleural effusion.
