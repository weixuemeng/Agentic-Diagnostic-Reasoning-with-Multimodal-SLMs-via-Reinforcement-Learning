  Mild pulmonary edema is stable compared to ___. Moderate cardiomegaly
  is unchanged. No large pleural effusions. Known lingular and bibasilar
  peribronchovascular consolidation, consistent with pneumonia, are better
  assessed on recent chest CT, although the right lung base does appear to have
  slightly more consolidation than on ___. Interval removal of left
  internal jugular line. Enteric tube remains in the stomach with distal tip not
  captured. Additional tubular structure overlying the median sternotomy wires
  may be outside the patient.
