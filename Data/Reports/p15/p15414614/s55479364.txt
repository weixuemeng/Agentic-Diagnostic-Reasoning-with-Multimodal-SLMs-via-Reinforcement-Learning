                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG/ECMO.  Evaluate tubes, and lines postoperative. 
 Tracheostomy/PEG.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi-erect chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain unchanged.  There is
 persistence or perhaps slight increase retrocardiac opacity, which may be
 related to increase in retrocardiac atelectasis although there is slightly
 increased opacity throughout the left hemithorax, which might be related to a
 small layering pleural effusion.
 
 A right-sided subclavian central venous catheter is present, terminating at
 the lower aspect of the SVC at the right atrial junction.  Sternotomy sutures
 are present, and appear intact.  Tracheostomy tube is not visualized on this
 study.  The patient has been extubated since the prior radiograph from 1 day
 ago.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Diffusely but mildly increased opacity of the left hemithorax,
 particularly in the retrocardiac region.  This may be a combination of
 layering pleural effusion and atelectasis.
 
 2.  Interval extubation.  Right sided central venous catheter remains at the
 cavoatrial junction.
