                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p NG placement  // eval for NG tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 07:55
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous image, the patient has received a Dobbhoff
 catheter. The tip of the catheter projects over the middle part of the
 stomach. There is no evidence of complications such as pneumothorax. The lung
 volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation, with
 subsequent decrease in extent and severity of the pre-existing parenchymal
 opacities.  The hemodialysis catheter and the Swan-Ganz catheter as well as
 the sternal wires are unchanged.
