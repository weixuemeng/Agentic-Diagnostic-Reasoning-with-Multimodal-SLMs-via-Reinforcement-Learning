                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p dobhoff placement  // ___F, intubated, s/p dobhoff
 placement with resistance  65cm, assess position/placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is 3.3 cm above the carina.  A Swan-Ganz catheter
 terminates in the main pulmonary artery . Dobbhoff tube is seen terminating
 within the stomach. Additionally, an esophageal tube is also seen terminating
 within the stomach.
 
 Assessment is limited due to patient rotation and low lung volumes. Bibasilar
 opacities, right greater than left are likely due to atelectasis, increased
 from prior.  A left retrocardiac opacity appears improved, but evaluation is
 limited on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Dobbhoff tube and esophageal tube seen terminating within the stomach.
 2. Bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis.
