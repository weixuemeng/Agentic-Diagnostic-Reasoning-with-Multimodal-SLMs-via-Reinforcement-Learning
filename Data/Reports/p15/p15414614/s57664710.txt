                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of a Dobbhoff tube that extends well into the stomach, before
 coiling back on itself and having the tip parallel to the hemidiaphragm in the
 fundus.  Otherwise, little change.
