  An endotracheal tube terminates 2.1 cm above the carinal and could be pulled
  back 1-2 cm for better placement. A Dobbhoff tube terminates within the
  stomach. A right internal jugular catheter is unchanged in position and
  terminates within the right atrium. A femoral Swan-Ganz catheter is unchanged.
  There is persistent peribronchial infiltration in the left mid and upper lung
  zones suggestive of infection. Lung volumes are low which somewhat accentuate
  bronchovascular markings. There is slightly increased bronchovascular
  congestion from the prior exam.
