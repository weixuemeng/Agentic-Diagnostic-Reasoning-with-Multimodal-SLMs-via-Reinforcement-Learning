  ETT is approximately 1.5-2 cm above the carina. The tube could be withdrawn 2
  cm for more optimal positioning. The right greater than left bibasilar
  opacities are unchanged from the prior study. The right pleural effusion
  appears more prominent, but may be secondary to more supine position of the
  patient. No pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists.
  Preliminary findings regarding ETT positioning were communicated to Dr. ___

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pea arrest  // intubation, tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ETT is approximately 1.5-2 cm above the carina. The tube could be withdrawn 2
 cm for more optimal positioning. The right greater than left bibasilar
 opacities are noted, with a right lower lung being more opacified on the
 current study potentially due to progression of the consolidation and or
 increase in right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion persists. Preliminary findings regarding ETT positioning
 were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___, ___ phone on ___ at 11:37 PM,
 1 minute(s) after discovery
