                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for rib fractures in a patient status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from the same day.  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates mildly low lung volumes with
 exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette.  Even allowing for this, the heart is
 moderately enlarged.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.  A displaced
 fracture of the posterolateral left ninth rib is is visualized.  Known
 nondisplaced fractures of the seventh and tenth left ribs are better evaluated
 on CT chest from the same day.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. A visualized displaced fracture of the posterolateral left ninth rib and
 nonvisualized but known nondisplaced fractures of the seventh and tenth left
 ribs are better evaluated on CT chest from the same day.
