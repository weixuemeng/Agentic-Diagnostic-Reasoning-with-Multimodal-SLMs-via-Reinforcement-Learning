                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer with Tarceva therapy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the dense opacification in
 the right mid lung zone is more diffuse with suggestion of increased reticular
 markings.  This would be consistent with some response to chemotherapy.  Has
 this patient also had radiation therapy in the region?
 
 Remainder of the study is unchanged.
