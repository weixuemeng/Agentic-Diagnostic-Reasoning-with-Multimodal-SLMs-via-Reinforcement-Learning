                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Sudden onset shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Again, there is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle,
 unchanged from prior, and likely related to pleural thickening.  Biapical
 scarring is stable.  The lungs are otherwise clear without a focal air space
 consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
