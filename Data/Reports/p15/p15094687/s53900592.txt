                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with sob, chf, elevated bnp  // eval for edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___, and
 CTA chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is enlarged.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions with
 bibasilar opacities, which likely reflect a combination of compressive
 atelectasis and pulmonary edema.  Additional opacity in the right midlung
 compatible with fluid tracking within the fissure.  Calcifications abutting
 the left lung base compatible calcified pleural plaques as on prior.  Left
 apical calcified scarring is noted.  A dual lead pacemaker device is present,
 with leads ending in the right atrium and right ventricle.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right and
 tracking within the fissure.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Followup after treatment to document resolution
