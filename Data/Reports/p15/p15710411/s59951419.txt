 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is no

 edema. Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal silhouette is stable with a
 large hiatal hernia, slightly larger than in ___. A rounded density
 projecting over the right lower chest on the frontal view is unchanged from
 ___, likely reflecting calcification of the costochondral cartilage. Severe
 degenerative change with on bone-on-bone articulation is seen at the right
 shoulder girdle, incompletely evaluated on this study.
