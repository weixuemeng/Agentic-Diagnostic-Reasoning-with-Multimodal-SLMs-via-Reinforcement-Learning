 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recent lysis of the adhesions, presenting with abdominal
 pain, question free air.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA upright and lateral views of the chest were provided. 
 Sternotomy hardware is noted.  Clips are noted in the anterior mediastinal
 space.  Underpenetrated technique limits evaluation of the lower lungs. 
 Allowing for these limitations, the lungs appear clear.  No convincing signs
 of free air below the right hemidiaphragm.  No effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Imaged osseous
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings in the chest.
