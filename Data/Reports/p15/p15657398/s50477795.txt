  1. New subtle opacity overlying the left upper lung, could be due to
  atelectasis versus infection.  Recommend followup to resolution.
  2. Stable nodular opacity at the left base.
  3. Stable mid thoracic vertebral compression deformity.
  4. Mild hyperinflation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperinflated.  A compression deformity of a mid thoracic
 vertebra is unchanged from prior studies.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  The previously seen nodular opacity at the left lung base is
 unchanged from the prior study.  A subtle opacity overlying the left upper
 lung appears new from the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New subtle opacity overlying the left upper lung, could be due to
 atelectasis versus infection.  Recommend followup to resolution.
 2. Stable nodular opacity at the left base.
 3. Stable mid thoracic vertebral compression deformity.
 4. Mild hyperinflation.
