 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is top normal.  There
 are granulomatous calcifications in the left hilum.  The aortic arch is
 calcified. There are severe degenerative changes in both shoulders with
 apparent inferior subluxation of the right shoulder.

 1. Very low lung volumes but no definite acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 2. Apparent inferior subluxation of the right shoulder may be
 projectional/positional. Please correlate clinically.
