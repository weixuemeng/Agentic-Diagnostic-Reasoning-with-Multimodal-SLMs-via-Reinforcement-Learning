                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with wheezing and SOB after blood transfusion  // Eval for
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Given differences in technique from exam from earlier the same day, there has
 been no significant interval change. Lower lung volumes are seen with
 secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings and accentuation of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette. Right mid lung opacity is likely atelectasis.
 Tortuosity of descending thoracic aorta is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
