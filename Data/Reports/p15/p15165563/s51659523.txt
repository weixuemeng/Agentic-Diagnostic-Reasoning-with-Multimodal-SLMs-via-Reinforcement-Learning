                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with transfusion dependent anemia, MDS with
 chronic neutropenia, pulmonary hypertention, s/p recent hospitalization with
 fever. Reporting increasing fatigue, weakness, DOE.  // Assess for
 abnormalities. ? infiltrate, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of bilateral hemidiaphragms,
 suggesting chronic pulmonary disease. The diffuse prominent interstitial
 markings which that were noted on the prior chest x-ray have improved, which
 likely suggests resolving interstitial edema.  Lungs are otherwise free of
 consolidations, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Mediastinum and hila are
 normal.  Mild cardiomegaly, stable since ___. No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improving diffuse interstitial markings likely suggests resolving interstitial
 edema. Diffuse infectious process is unlikely.
