                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with history of COPD.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies with the most recent chest CT from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Previously visualized spiculated right upper lobe opacity appears less
 conspicuous in comparison to the prior study suggesting a resolving infectious
 or inflammatory process.  Bibasilar opacities are noted likely representative
 of atelectasis.  Biapical bullous emphysematous changes are again noted. 
 Otherwise, the lungs are without any new focal consolidation.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours appear stable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No acute fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Biapical bullous emphysematous changes. Right upper lobe spiculated opacity
 appears less conspicuous in comparison to the prior study, suggesting a
 resolving infectious or inflammatory etiology.  A follow up chest CT, however,
 is recommended, as was noted on the prior CT report.
