                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HIV and right lung mass suspicious for malignancy.
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much better
 inspiration.  There is evidence of chronic pulmonary disease with relatively
 avascular upper lung on the right.  Spiculated mass is seen in the right mid
 zone, consistent with the FDG-avid opacity seen in the posterior segment of
 the right upper lobe adjacent to the major fissure on recent CT scan.
