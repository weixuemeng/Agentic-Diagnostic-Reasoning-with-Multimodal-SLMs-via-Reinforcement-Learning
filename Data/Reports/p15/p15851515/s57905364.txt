                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged, but there is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases may reflect areas of atelectasis.  Infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Patchy opacities in the
 lung bases may reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded.  Consider repeat PA and lateral views with improved inspiratory
 effort for further assessment of the lung bases.
