                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man in septic shock, Hodgkin's lymphoma, ischemic
 bowel, high airway pressures  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of the chest ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  New left internal
 jugular central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC.  ET tube is 6 cm
 from the carina.  Enteric tube courses into the stomach and beyond the field
 of view.
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There
 is mild worsening of left basilar opacity which may reflect combination of
 atelectasis and pleural effusion.  Right basilar atelectasis is unchanged. 
 Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Worsening left basilar opacity may reflect combination of pleural effusion
 and atelectasis, however underlying pneumonia cannot be completely excluded in
 the proper clinical setting.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.
 3. New left internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC
