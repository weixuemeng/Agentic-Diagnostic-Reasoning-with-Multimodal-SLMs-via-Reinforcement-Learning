                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated  // ? ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 8.2 cm from the carina, at the
 level of the thoracic inlet.  An enteric tube tip courses below the left
 hemidiaphragm, into the stomach, and off the inferior borders of the film. 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right
 atrium.  Heart size appears borderline enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded. Mild
 pulmonary edema is noted.  The lung volumes are low with patchy atelectasis
 demonstrated in the lung bases.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified, however the extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from the
 field of view.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube is slightly high, terminating at the level of thoracic
 inlet, and can be advanced by approximately 3 cm for optimal positioning.
 2. Enteric tube tip in standard position.
 3. Mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis.
