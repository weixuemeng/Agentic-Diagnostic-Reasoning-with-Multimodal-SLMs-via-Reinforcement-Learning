                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multiple myeloma, s/p sepsis with necrotic
 bowel resection.  // Eval for effusion, consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dating from ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral lower lung consolidations are seen right greater than left likely
 consistent with developing pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 moderately enlarged and unchanged from previous studies.  There is vascular
 congestion without pulmonary edema.  Again seen is a right-sided port with
 catheter tip terminating in the right atrium.  An over-distended stomach is
 seen likely compatible with patient's recent history of bowel are section and
 could be decompressed with an NG tube if clinically indicated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bilateral lower lung consolidations compatible with developing pneumonia.
 2. Over-distention of stomach secondary to postoperative sequelae.
