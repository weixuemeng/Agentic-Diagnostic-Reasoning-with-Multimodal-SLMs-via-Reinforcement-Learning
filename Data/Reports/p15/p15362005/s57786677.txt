 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of nasogastric tube, terminating within the
 stomach.  Left PICC remains in standard position, and cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable in appearance.  Marked improved aeration at right lung
 base with minimal residual pleural and parenchymal opacity remaining. 
 However, slight worsening of left lower lobe opacity, likely due to
 atelectasis with adjacent small-to-moderate pleural effusion.  Coexisting
 pneumonia is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
