                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Headache, lower extremity rash and sepsis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes persist.  Left sided dual-chamber pacemaker is re-
 demonstrated with leads terminating in unchanged positions.  Widening of the
 superior mediastinum is due to low lung volumes and technique.  The heart size
 again is likely top normal, but is accentuated due to poor inspiratory effort.
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  No overt pulmonary edema
 is seen.  There is likely mild bibasilar atelectasis though assessment for
 pneumonia is limited on this low lung volume study.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Suboptimal study due to low lung volumes.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis with
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures.
