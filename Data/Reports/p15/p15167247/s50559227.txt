                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.  Top normal size of the
 heart, unchanged from prior chest radiographs.  A left pectoral dual-chamber
 pacer is again noted.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax. Low lung volumes causes crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures, but no frank pulmonary edema is present. Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are again noted in the aortic arch.  Severe degenerative
 changes are partially imaged in the upper lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
