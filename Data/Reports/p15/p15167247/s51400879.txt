                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness and bradycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 The aortic arch is calcified.  Allowing for differences in technique, the
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is probably slight
 congestion with a mild interstitial abnormality including peribronchial
 cuffing although this is probably a background finding for which differential
 considerations include slight chronic pulmonary congestion or airway
 inflammation.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear aside from patchy posterior
 basilar opacity partly obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, suggesting minor
 atelectasis.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest.
