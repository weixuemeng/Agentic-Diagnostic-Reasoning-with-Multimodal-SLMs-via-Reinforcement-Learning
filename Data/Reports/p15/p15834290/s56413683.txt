                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable cardiomegaly with permanent pacemaker in place.  Low lung
 volumes accentuate the pulmonary vasculature.  With this limitation in mind,
 there is no definite evidence of congestive heart failure.  Patchy opacities
 are present at both lung bases and there is a suggestion of a small left
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy bibasilar opacities, likely due to atelectasis. 
 Differential diagnosis includes aspiration and early, developing pneumonia. 
 Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
