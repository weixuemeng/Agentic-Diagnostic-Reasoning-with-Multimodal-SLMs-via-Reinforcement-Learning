                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff  Assess placement.  Eating disorder.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE PORTABLE AP VIEW.  An additional view was obtained to include
 the upper abdomen.  A Dobbhoff-type tube is present.  A figure-of-eight
 contour suggests that it may pass through the pylorus into the duodenum, but
 the tubing lies  disproportionately on the left side, meaning that -- less
 likely -- it could also be coiled within the stomach.  
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, effusion or pneumothorax
 detected.  No free air identified beneath the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dobbhoff tube tip probably post-pyloric.  However,  the tubing
 lies disproportionately on the left side.  If clinically indicated, a lateral
 view may help to better assess this.
