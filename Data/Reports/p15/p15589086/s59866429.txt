                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with immunosuppression, presenting with fever. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Chronic mild
 cardiomegaly is stable.  Several calcified mediastinal lymph nodes, including
 within the aortopulmonic window, are compatible with inactive granulomatous
 disease.  Pulmonary vascular markings are normal.  The lungs are hyperinflated
 with flattened diaphragms, suggestive of mild COPD.  Curvilinear opacities
 overlying the right mid and lower lung fields are similar to prior and
 compatible with focal scarring.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mildly hyperinflated lungs, suggestive of COPD.  Chronic mild
 cardiomegaly.  No focal consolidation.
