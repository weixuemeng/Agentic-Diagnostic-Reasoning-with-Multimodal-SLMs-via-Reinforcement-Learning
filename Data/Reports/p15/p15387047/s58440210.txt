                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, PORTABLE
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with desaturations, evaluate for pneumonia,
 effusions.
 
 CHEST, PORTABLE:  No prior studies are available for comparison.  The lung
 volumes are low.  Allowing for this, the heart size is likely normal.  There
 is some crowding of the vasculature also, likely due to low inspiration.  The
 lungs are clear.  There are no pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes limit evaluation somewhat; however, there is no
 evidence of pneumonia.
