                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recent intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ETT is present in standard position.  A right internal jugular approach
 central venous catheter is present with tip in the right atrium.  Elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm is present. Opacity at the right lung base is likely
 accounted for by a combination of pleural effusion, atelectasis, although
 consolidation is also possible. Slight blunting at the left costophrenic angle
 is noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild interstitial edema is likely
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube in standard position. Right basilar opacity likely representing
 combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, although consolidation is
 possible.
