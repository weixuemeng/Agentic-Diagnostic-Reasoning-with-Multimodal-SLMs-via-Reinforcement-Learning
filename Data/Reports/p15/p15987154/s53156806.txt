                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with L chest tube  // Eval for PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from trauma series from ___ at 06:51 an ET
 tube is present,
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip lies 5.4 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is
 present, tip and side-port lie beneath the diaphragm overlying the gastric
 fundus.  Apparent temperature probe is also seen adjacent to the tip of the ET
 tube.  A left chest tube is in place, with tip near the left lung apex.
 
 The patient has a known tiny left apical pneumothorax that is obscured by
 overlying bones on this study.  On the right, no obvious pneumothorax.
 
 Again seen is extensive opacification of the left lung, most pronounced in the
 lower and, to a lesser extent, mid zones, compatible with a combination of
 lung contusion and aspiration.  Possibility of a small left effusion cannot be
 excluded
 
 There are coarsened markings the right cardiophrenic region which could
 reflect either aspiration or atelectasis.  No other focal infiltrate on the
 right.  No gross effusion.  .
 
 
 The patient has multiple known fracturesabout the chest, only some a which are
 readily apparent on this study.  .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left chest tube in place.  Tiny left apical pneumothorax seen on C-spine CT
 obtained earlier the same day is not apparent radiographically.
 
 Left lung opacification and right chronic the right cardiophrenic patchy
 opacity again noted.
