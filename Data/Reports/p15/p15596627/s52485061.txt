                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Five days of malaise, question acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are new from prior exam.  There is left
 basilar atelectasis and small left pleural effusion noted, also new from prior
 exam.  The heart appears top normal in size.  No convincing signs of
 pneumonia, though given the retrocardiac atelectasis, a subtle pneumonia is
 difficult to exclude.  Mediastinal contour appears normal.  Bony structures
 are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval sternotomy with left basal opacity, likely atelectasis,
 thought cannot exclude an early pneumonia.  Tiny left pleural effusion also
 present.
