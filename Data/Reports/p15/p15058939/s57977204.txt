                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post nasoenteric catheter placement.  Assess
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 8:41 a.m.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube is in
 standard expected position.  There has been interval placement of a
 nasoenteric catheter with the tip in the stomach, projecting over the left
 upper quadrant.  Moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged compared to recent
 prior examination from 20 minutes prior.  A linear density along the left
 diaphragmatic contour is stable since most recent prior, but new from the
 initial trauma radiograph from one day prior, likely something overlying the
 patient.  There has been no other significant change since recent exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of nasoenteric catheter with the tip in the
 stomach.  No other change from recent prior.
