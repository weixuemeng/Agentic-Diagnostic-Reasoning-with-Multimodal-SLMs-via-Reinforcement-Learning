                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left-sided weakness.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dense left retrocardiac opacity most likely represents atelectasis, but
 pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  Background
 interstitial pulmonary edema is mild.  Bilateral pleural effusions, small on
 the right, and trace on the left.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is moderately
 enlarged.  Note is made of a prostatic mitral valve.  Aortic arch
 calcifications are noted.  The median sternotomy wires are intact.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities identified.  No subdiaphragmatic free air.

 1. Left retrocardiac opacity most likely represents atelectasis, although
