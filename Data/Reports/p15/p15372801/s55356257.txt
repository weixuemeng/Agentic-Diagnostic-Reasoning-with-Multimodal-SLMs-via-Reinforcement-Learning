                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain for one week and fatigue.  Hit head on parking gate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Minimal linear opacification in the
 right mid lung is stable from the prior exam and likely represents scarring. 
 There is no evidence of consolidation or edema.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  A dual-chamber pacemaker is present and in unchanged
 position with the leads in the right ventricle and coronary sinus.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is unchanged from the prior exam.  Atherosclerotic calcifications
 are noted in the aortic arch.  Compression deformities in the lower thoracic
 spine are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Stable right mid lung scarring.
 3.  Unchanged lower thoracic compression deformities.
