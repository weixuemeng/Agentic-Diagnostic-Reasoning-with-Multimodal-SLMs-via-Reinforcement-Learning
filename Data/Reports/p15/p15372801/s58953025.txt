                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with abdominal pain.  Assess for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate pacemaker leads in
 unchanged positions.  There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema.  Linear areas of opacification involving right mid lung zone
 are less conspicuous on current study and likely correspond to areas of
 atelectasis.  The hilar and mediastinal silhouette are unchanged.  Aortic arch
 calcifications are again seen.  Anterior wedge deformities of the mid thoracic
 vertebral bodies appear longstanding.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
