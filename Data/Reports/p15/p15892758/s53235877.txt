                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall while getting out of bed this morning.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Lungs remain
 hyperinflated suggestive of COPD.  There appears to be mild bronchial wall
 thickening within the lower lobes, more pronounced than on the previous exam,
 which could reflect bronchial inflammation or infection.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There is diffuse
 calcification of the aorta.  Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.  No acute osseous abnormality is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bronchial wall thickening suggestive of inflammation or infection.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is seen.
