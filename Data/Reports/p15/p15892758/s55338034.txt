                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and leg swelling.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is a new
 nonspecific retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragmatic border. 
 Coinciding pleural effusion is not excluded on the left.  There is probably a
 very small pleural effusion on the right.  There are also mild congestive
 changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New retrocardiac opacification, a typical site for atelectasis although
 pneumonia is not excluded.  Findings suggest mild vascular congestion.
