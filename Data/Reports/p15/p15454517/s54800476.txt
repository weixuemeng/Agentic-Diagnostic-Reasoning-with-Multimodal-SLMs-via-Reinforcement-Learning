                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Technique chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Allowing for that, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are probably unchanged and increased densities at lung bases can
 probably be attributed to crowding of bronchovascular structures.  The lungs
 appear otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes but no convincing evidence for acute cardiopulmonary disease.
