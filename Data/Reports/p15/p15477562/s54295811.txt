                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with clinical symptoms of CHF.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There persists an abandoned pacer lead from the right.  A left
 pacer unit demonstrates leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.  The
 heart size is markedly enlarged, but similar to prior study.  The hilar
 contours demonstrate fullness of the vasculature and some there is
 indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels throughout the lungs, compatible with
 mild pulmonary edema.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Minimal degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema compatible with mild heart
 failure.
