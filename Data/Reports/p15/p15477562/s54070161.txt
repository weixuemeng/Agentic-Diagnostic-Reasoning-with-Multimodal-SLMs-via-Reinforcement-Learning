 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs of pulmonary
 edema are increasing.  These increasing signs of pulmonary edema lead to
 opacities at both lung bases, right more than left, and with visualization of
 Kerley B lines.  New minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus could
 suggest the presence of a small right pleural effusion.  Status post
 sternotomy, cardiomegaly, left pectoral pacemaker.
