                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 8:10
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with bacteremia, right ventricular failure
 and end-stage renal disease, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 8:10 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular large-bore dual-lumen catheter with the most distal
 tip in the right atrium, right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with its
 tip in the pulmonary outflow tract, and left-sided pacer unchanged.  The heart
 remains enlarged despite marked patient rotation.  There is increasing
 perihilar vasculature which is suggestive of worsening perihilar edema.  There
 is likely layering left effusion.  At least one old left-sided rib fracture is
 appreciated.  No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
