                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and leukocytosis.  Attempt PA and lateral to
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. 
 There is re-demonstration of a left-sided pacemaker with biventricular leads. 
 Midline sternotomy wires are again noted, with surgical clips suggestive of
 prior CABG.  An abandoned right-sided pacer lead is again noted. 
 Heterogeneous left lower lung opacities are slightly increased compared to the
 prior study from ___, likely atelectasis.  There is minimal right
 basilar atelectasis.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is not significantly
 changed.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The mediastinal
 contours are not significantly changed.  There are no definite pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight increase in heterogeneous left lower lung opacities, likely
 atelectasis.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion in the setting of marked enlargement of
 the cardiac silhoutte is suggestive of a pericardial effusion versus
 cardiomyopathy.
