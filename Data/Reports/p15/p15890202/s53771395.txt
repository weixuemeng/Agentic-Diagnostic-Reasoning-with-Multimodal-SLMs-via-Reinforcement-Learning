                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and weight loss.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and Chest CT from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs appear hyperinflated suggestive of chronic airways disease. The
 lungs are however clear with no evidence of a consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Known sub 5 mm left upper lobe and right lower lobe nodules are
 not well evaluated on this study.  The thoracic aorta appears tortuous and
 demonstrates mild atherosclerotic calcifications at the arch.  Otherwise,
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are normal.  No acute fractures are
 identified and there is dextroscoliosis of the mid thoracic spine. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. The lungs appear hyperinflated suggestive of
 chronic airways disease
