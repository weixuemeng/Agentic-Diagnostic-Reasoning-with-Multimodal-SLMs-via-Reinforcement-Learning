                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from ___ and PA and
 lateral chest radiographs from ___. CT torso ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 A small opacity within the right lung apex is unchanged.  This could reflect
 an area of confluent consolidation, though also could be residual scarring at
 that site.  Lung volumes are low resulting in bronchovascular crowding with
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  However, no other confluent
 consolidations are identified.  No large pleural effusions are identified. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Surgical clips
 are seen within the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small focal opacity in the right lung apex, similar to prior.  Findings
 could reflect focal pneumonia, though could also be related to scarring at the
 site of prior infection.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
