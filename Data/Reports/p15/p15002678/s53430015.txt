 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy and chronic cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 better inspiration.  There is still some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels
 consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  The area of suspected
 opacification in the right apical region is not clearly seen, though it could
 be superimposed by overlying clavicle and posterior rib.  No definite focal
 consolidation is appreciated.
