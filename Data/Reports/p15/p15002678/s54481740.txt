                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL RIGHT DECUBITUS CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with right pleural effusion.  Decubitus view to
 assess volume.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA, lateral and decubitus view of the chest compared to ___:

 A cluster of small nodules and peribronchial infiltration in the right lung
 apex laterally, projecting over the first anterior interspace, developed
 between ___ and ___.  They have not resolved.  Most likely
 explanation is non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection, but tuberculosis is
