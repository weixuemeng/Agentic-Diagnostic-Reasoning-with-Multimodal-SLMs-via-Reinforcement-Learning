                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Increased, moderate left pleural effusion shifts the mediastinum rightward and
 obscures some of the left lung base, but atelectasis if any, is secondary to,
 not the cause of the effusion which could be empyema, other exudate, or under
 the appropriate circumstances, hemothorax.  Mild edema is present in the left
 lung, but there is no appreciable right pleural effusion.  Cardiac silhouette
 is larger and a pericardial effusion might be present.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Given the history of cirrhosis and recent treatment to liver
 cancer, Abdomen CT is recommended to look for a cause of new left pleural
 effusion; if that is not revealing, CT should be continued into the chest
 using CTA protocol to detect pulmonary embolus.
 
 New mild pulmonary edema. Possible pericardial effusion.
   
 
 Findings were discussed with ___ by ___ by telephone at
 06:57 on ___ at the time of discovery.
