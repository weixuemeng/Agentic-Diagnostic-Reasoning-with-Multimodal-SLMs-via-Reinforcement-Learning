                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Interval hypoxemic respiratory failure, evaluate for interval
 change status post aggressive diuresis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-portable chest radiograph is provided.  A right PICC
 terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Compared to the prior exam, there has
 been progression of pulmonary edema, now worse at the lung apices.  Moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions are constant.  The heart remains enlarged,
 although definite borders are difficult to ascertain.  Apparent leftward
 displacement of aortic knob calcifications is likely due to patient rotation
 as the aorta now projects over the spine. Clips are noted at the left upper
 quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progression of pulmonary edema since prior exam.  Stable layering
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
