 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:52 PM
  Enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm, extending within
  the gastric cardia.  There is a sharp angulation along the distal aspect of
  the enteric catheter, just beyond the expected location of the
  gastroesophageal junction.  Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube. 
  Otherwise, no significant change compared to the study from earlier today.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the placement of the NG tube.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier.
 
 The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach. 
 The heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged.  The patient continues
 to be in pulmonary edema associated with bilateral large pleural effusions.
 
 Sharp angulation along the distal aspect of the enteric catheter is noted,
 most likely with no clinical significance.  Previous radiopaque material
 projecting over the left upper quadrant is noted, related to previous
 splenectomy.
