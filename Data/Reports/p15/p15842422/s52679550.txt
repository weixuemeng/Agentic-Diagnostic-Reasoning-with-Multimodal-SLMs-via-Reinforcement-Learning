                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increase in O2 requirement  // Please
 evaluate for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___ radiograph, lung volumes are lower.  Pulmonary
 vascular congestion is accompanied by new interstitial edema.  New patchy
 bibasilar opacities could reflect dependent edema, aspiration, atelectasis, or
 developing infectious pneumonia.  Short-term followup radiographs may be
 helpful in this regard.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are also noted.
