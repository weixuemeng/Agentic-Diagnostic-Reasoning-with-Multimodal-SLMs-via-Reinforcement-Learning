                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of confusion, altered
 mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The patient
 is rotated to the left and the patient's chin overlies the left lung apex
 obscuring the view.  There are low lung volumes.  In the interval since the
 prior study, there has been development of a small-to-moderate left pleural
 effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Underlying consolidation cannot be
 entirely excluded.  Bibasilar areas of atelectasis are seen.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion as well.  TIPS is noted projecting over the
 right upper quadrant, unchanged in position since the prior study.  Left upper
 quadrant coils/clips are also seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 demonstrated a top normal cardiac silhouette and a somewhat tortuous aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Interval development of small-to-moderate left pleural
 effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be
 excluded.  Pulmonary vascular congestion.
