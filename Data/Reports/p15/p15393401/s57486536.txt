                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Since the
 prior study, there has been interval increase in perihilar opacities, right
 greater than left, which may be due to infectious process with possible
 superimposed edema.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged with left
 ventricular configuration.  The aortic knob is calcified.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen, although trace effusions are difficult to exclude.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of right perihilar opacity while could
 relate to asymmetric edema, infectious process is also in the differential. 
 No large pleural effusion; however, trace bilateral pleural effusions
 difficult to exclude.
