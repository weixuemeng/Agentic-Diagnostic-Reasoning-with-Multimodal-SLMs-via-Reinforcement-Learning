                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with end-stage renal
 disease and hypertension.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is substantial, unchanged since the prior study, but there is
 interval improvement in interstitial pulmonary edema.  Still present right
 basal opacity might reflect the residua as well as a combination of pleural
 effusion with atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.
