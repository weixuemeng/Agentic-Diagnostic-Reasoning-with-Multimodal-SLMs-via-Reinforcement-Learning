                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, ___, and
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are small bilateral pleural effusions with fluid extending
 into the major and minor fissures bilaterally.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  Rounded densities projecting over the peripheral right upper
 lung zone on the AP view may represent pulmonary nodules.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial edema.  The cardiac silhouette is
 mild-to-moderately enlarged, but stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  Partial calcification of the aortic knob is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial edema.
 3.  Right upper lobe densities, for which followup chest CT could be
 considered on a non-urgent basis.
