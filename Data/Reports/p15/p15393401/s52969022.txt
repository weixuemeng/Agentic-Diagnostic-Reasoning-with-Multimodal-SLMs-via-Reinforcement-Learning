                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 15:20
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with left fifth toe pain and cellulitis,
 going for angiogram, preop study.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 5:13.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 15:20 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The heart remains enlarged and there is unfolding and prominence to the
 aorta.  There are subtle patchy opacities at both lung bases which may
 represent atelectasis in the setting of somewhat diminished lung volumes,
 although an early pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Calcification
 at the aortic knob consistent with atherosclerosis.
