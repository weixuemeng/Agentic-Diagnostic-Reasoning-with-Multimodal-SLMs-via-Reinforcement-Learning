                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Still AP semi-erect portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is bibasilar atelectasis.  Basilar opacities may relate to atelectasis
 although, underlying pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting vertically at the medial left lung base.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen although trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude.  There may
 be minimal interstitial edema.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Aortic calcifications are seen.  There is no pneumothorax.
