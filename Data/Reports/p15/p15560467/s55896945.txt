                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for effusion and assess gastric bubble.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  As before, the
 patient is status post midline sternotomy and CABG.  Marked elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragm is not significantly changed.  Heterogeneous opacities in
 the right mid to lower lung have substantially decreased compared to the prior
 study from ___, likely atelectasis.  There is also volume loss at
 the left lung base.  The heart size is difficult to assess but does not appear
 significantly changed.  The mediastinal contours are not significantly
 changed.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted. 
 There is redemonstration of a mitral valve annuloplasty.  There may be small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  The air-filled gastric bubble is identified in
 an appropriate retrocardiac position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Decreased right mid-to-lower lung opacities, consistent with improving
 atelectasis.  Unchanged volume loss at the left lung base.
 
 2.  Marked left hemidiaphragm elevation, not significantly changed.
 
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, containing less than 200 ml of fluid.
