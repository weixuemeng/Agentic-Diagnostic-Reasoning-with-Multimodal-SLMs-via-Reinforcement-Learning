                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary embolism and pleural effusions.  Question size of
 effusions.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a moderate-to-large pleural effusion on the left that
 appears probably free-flowing, while on the right, a large lenticular opacity
 projecting over the medial right mid lung suggests a large loculated pleural
 effusion along the posterior chest.  A chest tube projects along the base of
 the right hemithorax with patchy opacities that suggest a combination of
 atelectasis or pneumonia with small possible areas of additional loculated
 pleural effusion.  Upper lungs are relatively spared, but with a mild
 interstitial abnormality suggesting mild vascular congestion.  Pleural
 effusions have increased since the prior radiographs.  However, findings at
 the right base in the vicinity of a right-sided chest tube are relatively
 little changed.
