 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, lymph node involvement. 
 Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has developed
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  These effusions are already documented
 on the CT examination from ___.  Effusions cause substantial
 atelectasis at both the left and the right lung bases.  In addition, as shown
 on CT, the patient shows mild interstitial fluid overload.  The small nodular
 structures seen on the CT examination are not seen on the current chest x-ray.
 The visible parts of the cardiac silhouette are at the upper range of normal
 regarding their size.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
