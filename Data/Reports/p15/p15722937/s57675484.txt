                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with septic shock from right upper thigh necrotizing soft
 tissue infection s/p debridement x 4, VAC placement s/p bronchoscopy  // s/p
 bronchoscopy     s/p bronchoscopy
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 5:11 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been no appreciable change since earlier in the day following
 substantial improvement in widespread pulmonary consolidation compared to
 ___.  Residual opacification is present throughout the lungs, much
 improved in all locations, except the lingula.  This raises the possibility of
 improving edema, largely cardiogenic given the previous distension of
 mediastinal and pulmonary vessels, and concurrent pneumonia.  Pleural
 effusions are presumed, but not large.  Heart is normal size and mediastinal
 and pulmonary vasculature no longer engorged.
 ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements.  Left PIC line
 ends just outside the chest.  Nasogastric tube passes into the upper portion
 of a nondistended stomach and out of view.
