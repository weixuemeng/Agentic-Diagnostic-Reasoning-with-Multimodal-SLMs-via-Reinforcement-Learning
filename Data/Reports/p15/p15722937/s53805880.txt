                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure s/p intubation  // Is
 ETT in place?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 05:32
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The
 tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.6 cm above the carinal. The right
 internal jugular vein catheter and the nasogastric tube are in unchanged
 position. The volume of both the left and the right hemi thorax has increased,
 likely as an consequence of intubation, but the bilateral predominantly
 perihilar extensive and severe parenchymal opacities are even denser than on
 the previous radiograph.  The changes are reflecting centralized pulmonary
 edema. Moderate cardiomegaly, retrocardiac atelectasis.  No pleural effusions.
