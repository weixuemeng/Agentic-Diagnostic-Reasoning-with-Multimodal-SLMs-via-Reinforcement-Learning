 ?PNA  // ?evolving PNA, parapneumonic effusion      ?evolving PNA,
 parapneumonic effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been the virtual clearing of
 the opacification at the right base medially with some reduction in the area
 of opacification at the left base.  This is consistent with progressive
 healing of bilateral lower lung pneumonia.  The small pleural effusion seen on
 the previous study is probably unchanged.
