                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with acid-fast bacilli in sputum and congestive
 heart failure.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest.  Left perihilar and left basilar
 opacities are worsened compared to ___, though similar to
 ___.  Extensive right lung opacities are similar to prior,
 though slightly improved in the right mid-lung region. Known area of
 cavitation in right upper lobe is present consistent with necrotizing
 pneumonia. Indistinct vascular markings are suggestive of superimposed
 pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is similar to prior
 and compatible with a small pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax or radiopaque
 foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities, right greater than
 left, with apparent worsening of left perihilar and basilar opacities since
 ___, though similar to ___.  Findings are
 compatible with known history of multifocal pneumonia although superimposed
 edema may be present.
