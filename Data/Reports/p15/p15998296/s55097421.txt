                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with TB, and pulmonary edema.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Tracheostomy is in similar
 position.  Right IJ CVC is in the mid SVC.  The heart and cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  Widespread parenchymal opacities, right greater than
 left, are slightly improved in the right upper and left lower lungs.  No
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval improvement in right upper and left lower
 heterogeneous opacities, with stable additional areas of widespread
 parenchymal opacities.  Findings are overall consistent with improved
 pulmonary edema superimposed on multifocal pneumonia.
