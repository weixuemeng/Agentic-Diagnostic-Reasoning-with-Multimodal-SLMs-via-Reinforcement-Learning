                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with an outside hospital radiograph from ___ at 4:57
 p.m.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxia, status post fall, currently being treated for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  Comparison is also
 made with a prior study from ___.  Extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities
 persist, which is compatible with known pneumonia.  There may be a component
 of superimposed edema though this is somewhat difficult to assess given the
 extensive background pneumonia.  A right pleural effusion appears somewhat
 loculated.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is impossible to assess.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities compatible with known
 pneumonia with possible superimposed mild edema.
