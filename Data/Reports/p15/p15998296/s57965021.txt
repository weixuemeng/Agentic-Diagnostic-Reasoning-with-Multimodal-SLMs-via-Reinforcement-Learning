                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Continued fever and cough.  History of recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Central pulmonary arteries appear enlarged.  There are persistent widespread
 multifocal opacities suggesting pneumonia, most extensive in the upper lobes. 
 These are seen in a background diffuse interstitial abnormality which may
 represent part of a widespread infectious process, although coinciding
 etiologies such as fluid overload or interstitial lung disease are also
 possible.  A right lower lung opacity which had worsened since the earliest
 study has now improved slightly, but other opacities are little if at all
 changed.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones
 appear demineralized.  There is a mild anterior wedge compression deformity
 along the lower thoracic spine, likely chronic. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent multifocal opacities suggesting pneumonia, fairly
 similar in overall distribution; the only clear change is somewhat improved
 aeration at the right lung base.  A coinciding interstitial abnormality may
 indicate an additional process such as fluid overload or interstitial disease.
 Comparison to earlier studies predating acute illness may be helpful to
 evaluate further and possibly CT if needed clinically.
