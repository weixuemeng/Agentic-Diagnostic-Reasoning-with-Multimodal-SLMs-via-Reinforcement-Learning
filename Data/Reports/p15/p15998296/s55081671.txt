                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available. Per ED intake note, there is a
 prior chest CT, which is not available in our system for comparison. 
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The
 patient is very rotated. Scattered extensive bilateral air space opacities are
 noted, right worse than left, some of which have a rounded appearance, likely
 pneumonia. The minor fissure is elevated suggesting right upper lobe
 atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Blunting of the right costophrenic
 sulcus may represent a tiny pleural effusion. No left effusion. A small
 sclerotic focus in the proximal right humerus is incompletely evaluated,
 probably a bone island.
 
 IMPRESSION: Extensive scattered bilateral air space opacities are likely
 multifocal pneumonia. Recommend follow up radiographs to resolution. If this
 does not resolve on radiographs, repeat CT is recommended to exclude
 underlying malignancy. Per the ED notes, there is a prior chest CT, which is
 not available in our system at this time.
