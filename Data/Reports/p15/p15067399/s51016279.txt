  Diffusely increased interstitial markings again noted, similar prior exam and
  suggestive of chronic interstitial parenchymal abnormality versus possible
  mild interstitial edema. Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with  fall  //  ? fx, bleed
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright AP images of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded. Diffusely increased interstitial markings are
 again noted, improved prior exam, which are non-specific.  No focal
 abnormality or evidence of edema is seen. Probable left lower lobe atelectasis
 is again noted. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Median sternotomy wires
 mediastinal clips are noted.  The cardiac apex is prominent, which may reflect
 left ventricular hypertrophy or aneurysmatic dilatation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Diffuse non-specific interstitial markings, improved prior exam.  No
 evidence of edema.
 
 2.  Prominent cardiac apex, which may reflect left ventricular hypertrophy or
 aneurysmatic dilatation.  Recommend correlation with echocardiography if
 clinically indicated.
