                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall in a patient with dementia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  CT cervical spine.  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Supine frontal radiograph of the chest was reviewed. The heart size is normal.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Leftward shift of the heart
 with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is indicative of left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Interstitial prominence may be chronic or indicative of mild
 pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. Median sternotomy wires and CABG
 clips are noted. Prominence of the left first rib costosternal junction is
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Left lower lobe atelectasis.
 1. Mild edema or chronic interstitial parenchymal abnormality.
 2. Prominence of the left 1st rib costosternal junction. Clinical correlation
 with focal tenderness in this location is recommended.
