                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough, wheezing, presyncope
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Vague ovoid 7 mm
 opacity projecting over the left upper lobe and left second anterior rib was
 not apparent on the previous radiograph.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.  Multilevel degenerative changes with anterior osteophytes are seen
 in the imaged thoracolumbar spine.  Mild loss of height of a low thoracic
 vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 2. Vague 7 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left upper lobe and left
 second anterior rib, potentially a pulmonary nodule, and not seen on the
 previous exam.  This can be further assessed with bilateral oblique imaging to
 determine if this is a true pulmonary nodule or superimposition of overlying
 structures.
