                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of distal radius
 fracture, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle
 opacity projecting over the left costophrenic angle likely relates to
 overlying soft tissue versus minimal atelectasis.  No pleural effusion is seen
 on the lateral view.  There is no focal consolidation or evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and
 unremarkable.  Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
