                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pleuritic chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal patchy opacities are
 seen at the lung bases.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases, likely
 atelectasis.
