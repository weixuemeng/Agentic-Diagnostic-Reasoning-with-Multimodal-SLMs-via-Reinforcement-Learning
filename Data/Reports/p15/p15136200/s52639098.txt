                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with epigastric pain sudden onset with
 nausea/vomiting
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Interstitial and reticular opacities predominantly at
 the lung bases bilaterally is compatible with a chronic interstitial lung
 disease with fibrosis and honeycombing.  Heart size is mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding of
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.  No subdiaphragmatic free air is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No subdiaphragmatic free air.  Chronic interstitial lung disease with
 fibrosis, findings which can be better characterized with high-resolution
 chest CT if not done previously.
