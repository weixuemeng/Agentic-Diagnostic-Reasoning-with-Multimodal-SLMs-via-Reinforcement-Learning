                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and chest pain.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low.  Bilateral increased interstitial markings and
 perihilar fullness is compatible with interval development of mild pulmonary
 edema.  Small, likely bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  Mild diffuse
 airspace opacification, bilateral by greater on the right, is noted. There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  Stable, mild cardiomegaly is present. 
 Redemonstrated, is a single lead AICD with an intact lead seen extending into
 the right ventricle.  Surgical clips are again seen along the anterior and
 lateral right chest wall.  No acute bony abnormality is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Stable, mild
 cardiomegaly.
