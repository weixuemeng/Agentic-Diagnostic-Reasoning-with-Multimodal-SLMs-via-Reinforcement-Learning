                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again hyperexpansion of
 the lungs with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and no definite
 pneumonia.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Probable small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 
 There is little change in the single-lead AICD with the tip in the right
 ventricle.  The device loops in the region of the tricuspid valve.
