                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  COPD versus CHF.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single-lead pacemaker terminates in the right ventricle where it
 makes a single loop.  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified, particularly along the arch.  There is no definite pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The chest is hyperinflated.  There is upper zone
 redistribution of pulmonary vasculature.  The vasculature is perhaps slightly
 indistinct, particularly in the right upper lung, where it is somewhat more
 prominent than the left.  Still, despite asymmetry, this appearance is
 suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion and includes widespread
 bronchial cuffing, again somewhat more prominent in the right lung than left. 
 A mild lower thoracic compression deformity with anterior wedging appears
 likely chronic.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Interstitial abnormality suggesting mild vascular congestion;
 although perhaps less likely, particularly noting some asymmetry, widespread
 inflammatory process involving the airways could be considered as an
 alternative for coinciding etiology.
