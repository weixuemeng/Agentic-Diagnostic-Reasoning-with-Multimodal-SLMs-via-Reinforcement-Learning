                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:   Left exudative pleural effusion .
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___ at 12:47 p.m., there has been interval increase in the
 left pleural effusion, with increased atelectasis at the left lung base. 
 There is probable loculation of the left effusion. .  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change. Nodular density in the left mid zone, seen on
 only one view, is unchanged.Background cardiomegaly and possible background
 hyperinflation/COPD.  No CHF, right-sided infiltrate, or right effusion. 
 Scattered atelectasis noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left loculated effusion and left base collapse and/or consolidation, with
 increase in left effusion and left base atelectasis.
 
 2.  Focal nodular density in the left mid zone, of uncertain significance.  If
 this fails to resolve in the acute setting, then further assessment with CT
 would be recommended.
