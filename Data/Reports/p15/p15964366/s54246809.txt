                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with COPD and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  T-spine radiographs of the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate increased lung volumes. 
 There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggestive of pleural
 thickening.  There is no right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is top normal.  There is
 no pulmonary edema.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.  Surgical
 clips project over right upper abdomen.  There is compression deformity of the
 lower thoracic vertebral body, better assessed on dedicated thoracic spine
 radiographs of the same date of uncertain chronicity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle likely reflects pleural thickening.
