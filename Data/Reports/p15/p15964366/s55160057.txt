                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 There again is opacification with an accessory minor fissure as well as along
 the left lateral chest wall and blunting of the costophrenic angle.  There is
 slightly more prominent opacification at the left base, extending from the
 pleural surface inward.  This could represent a small loculated collection of
 fluid.
 
 No evidence of vascular congestion.  The right lung and upper half of the left
 lung are clear.
