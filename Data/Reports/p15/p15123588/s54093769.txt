                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Foul smelling wound overlying the right tibia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is normal.  The aorta is
 tortuous and diffusely calcified.  While there is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures, more focal patchy opacities at the lung bases may
 reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  There
 is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities at the lung bases could
 reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
