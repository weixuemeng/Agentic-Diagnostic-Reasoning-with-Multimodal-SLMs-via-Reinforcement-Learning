                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with shortness of breath, previous
 abnormal chest CT, evaluate for acute infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest
 examination of ___.  The heart size is at the upper limit of
 normal variation.  No typical configurational abnormalities identified;
 however, there is a relative prominence of the left ventricular contour, a
 finding which in conjunction with the moderately widened and elongated
 thoracic aorta suggests the possibility of systemic hypertension.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested and there is no evidence of acute
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates.  Lateral pleural sinuses are free and the
 same holds for the posterior pleural sinuses as identified on the lateral
 view.  Comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of
 ___.  There existed at that time a diffuse increased distended
 pulmonary vascular pattern with perivascular haze.  At the same time, a
 worrisome prominence of the right hilar region was identified, which led to a
 subsequent chest CT followup examination.  No mass was found.  
 
 On today's chest examination, most of the previously identified pulmonary
 congestive pattern has normalized and presently there is no evidence of acute
 CHF or infiltrates.  Previously described orthopedic hardware in the neck
 region remains unchanged with included multiple posterior fixation screws in
 the degenerated cervical spine.
