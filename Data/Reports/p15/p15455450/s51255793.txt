                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ critical AS recent admission for acute on chronic
 decompensated CHF, Afib on rivoraxaban, and previous GI bleed, presenting with
 fatigue, dyspnea, recent O2 requirement and worsening recurrent L pleural
 effusion now s/p L TPC and with recurrent pna.  // Eval interval change with
 PNA and L pul effusion   Eval interval change with PNA and L pul effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 Previous pneumothorax has probably resolved the low loose skin folds
 projecting over the left hemi thorax and presence of subcutaneous emphysema in
 left chest wall make that determination uncertain although there is a small
 left pleural effusion.  The new triangular region of radiodensity in the left
 midlung is probably collapse of the superior segment left lower lobe.  Right
 lower lobe is still largely collapsed accompanied by small to moderate right
 pleural effusion.  Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic.
 
 Conventional PA and lateral chest radiographs strongly recommended.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  PA and lateral chest radiographs when feasible.
