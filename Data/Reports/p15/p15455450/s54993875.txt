                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with small apical PTX s/p CT placement  // any
 change in size of PTX?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph from earlier the same date, a left pleural
 catheter has changed in position, and a moderate left pneumothorax has
 slightly increased in size, with both apical and lateral components.  Exam is
 otherwise remarkable for improving consolidation at the right lung base,
 potentially a resolving focus of aspiration although infectious pneumonia is
 also possible in the appropriate setting.
