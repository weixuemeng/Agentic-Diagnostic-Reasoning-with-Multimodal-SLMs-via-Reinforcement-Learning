                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with likely L lobe collapse  // Comparison
 ___ at 9:20AM
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to chest radiograph from earlier today, left-sided pleural drain
 remain in similar position.  Left hydro pneumothorax appears more conspicuous.
 Air fluid level in the left hemithorax is due to fluid along the major fissure
 and pneumthorax. Left lower lobe substantial opacities are unchanged.  Small
 right-sided effusion has shifted due to upright chest radiograph and
 persistent right lower lobe consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate left hydro pneumothorax with air fluid due to fluid along major
 fissure.  Multifocal basilar opacities and effusions have not substantially
 changed given for differences in positioning.
