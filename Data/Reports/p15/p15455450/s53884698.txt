                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough and dyspnea  // eval for pna, effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  CT heart ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Large left pleural effusion with likely associated atelectasis appears similar
 to prior, obscuring the left heart border.  Hazy right basilar opacity is
 likely due to atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal where seen. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No
 free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Large left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis appears similar to
 prior.  Superimposed infection is a possibility.
 2. Hazy right basilar opacity is likely due to atelectasis based on prior CT,
 but superimposed infection is a possibility.
