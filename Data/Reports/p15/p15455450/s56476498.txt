  1. Interval development of a left-sided pneumothorax, measuring approximately
  1.2 cm at apex.  However, there is also a basilar component adjacent to the
  newly placed pigtail catheter.
  2. Left pleural effusion has essentially resolved status post pigtail catheter
  placement.
  3. Apparently new opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle, unclear if this
  represents atelectasis or infection.  A standard PA and lateral film could be
  obtained for further evaluation.
  
  The findings were discussed with the, M.D. by ___, M.D. on the
  telephone on ___ at 7:05 PM, 1 minutes after discovery of the findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new left chest tube.  // ? ptx
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph from 1 day earlier, a left pleural catheter is been
 placed, with near resolution of left pleural effusion and development of a
 moderate left pneumothorax with apical and basilar components.  Exam is
 otherwise remarkable for new focal consolidation in the right lower lobe,
 which may reflect aspiration or a developing infectious pneumonia.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Documented in the wet reading below.
