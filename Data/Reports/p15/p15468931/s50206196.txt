                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:41 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after exploratory laparotomy, check ET and NG tube
 placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Nasogastric tube and ET tube are in standard placements respectively.  Lungs
 are very low in volume, exaggerating what is clearly pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  Heart is normal size, and given low lung volumes, mild
 interstitial edema cannot be excluded, but is probably not present.  No
 pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
