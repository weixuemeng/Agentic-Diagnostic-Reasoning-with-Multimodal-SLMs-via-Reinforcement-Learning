                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Marked
 interval improved aeration of the right lung, with essential resolution of
 previously identified opacity in the right upper and mid lung regions, as well
 as improving opacity in the right lower lobe.  Right pleural effusion has also
 substantially decreased in size.  On the left, a small pleural effusion has
 decreased in size with persistent adjacent area of atelectasis.  No new areas
 of consolidation are present within the remainder of the lungs, and there is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.
