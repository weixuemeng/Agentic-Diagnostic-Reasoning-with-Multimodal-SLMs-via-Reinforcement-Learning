                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacemaker lead.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Left subclavian pacemaker leads extend to the
 area of the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 
 Hyperexpansion of the lungs suggest some chronic pulmonary disease.  Cardiac
 silhouette is within upper limits of normal.  Mild prominence of interstitial
 markings could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure, chronic lung
 disease, or both.
