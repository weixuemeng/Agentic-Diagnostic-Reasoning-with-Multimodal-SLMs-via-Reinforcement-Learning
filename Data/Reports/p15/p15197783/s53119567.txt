                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male history of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Streaky opacity is identified at the
 lung bases most likely due to atelectasis.  There is no effusion or confluent
 consolidation.  On the lateral view, there is increased opacity projecting
 over the cardiac silhouette extending superiorly with well-defined anterior
 margin.  This is thought to represent external soft tissues given lack of
 correlative opacity on the frontal view.  On the right, there is suggestion of
 either diffuse pleural thickening or prominent extrapleural fat. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
