                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and hypoxemia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate severe emphysema with
 distortion of pulmonary architecture.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged, demonstrating a calcified and tortuous aorta, with a heart which is
 normal in size.  Oher than chronic mild bibasilar atelectasis, lungs are
 clear.  Again seen are old right lateral rib fractures with associated
 traumatic pleural thickening.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are either
 chronic or recurrent.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Other than chronic mild bibasilar atelectasis, the lungs are clear without
 evidence of pneumonia. 
 
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are either chronic or recurrent.
