                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white blood cell count, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  Mediastinal vascular
 engorgement and interstitial abnormality bilaterally is consistent with
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema accompanied by trace pleural effusions. 
 Slightly more focal opacity in the right base could reflect developing
 infectious process or asymmetric edema.  The heart is mildly enlarged with
 normal cardiomediastinal contours aside for mild aortic tortuosity and
 calcification.  Old right rib fractures are identified.  Exaggerated thoracic
 kyphosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate pulmonary edema with trace pleural effusions.  In
 this setting, slightly more focal opacity in the right lower lung could
 reflect asymmetric edema; however, an infectious process could be better
 assessed for after diuresis with repeat radiographs.
