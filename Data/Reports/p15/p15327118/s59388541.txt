                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of fatigue and malaise,
 history of bilobar pneumonia in past, increased ESR and CK, questionable
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  Moderate cardiac enlargement similar as on preceding examination. 
 Configuration suggests a relative prominence of the left ventricular contour,
 a finding which in conjunction with the moderately widened thoracic aorta
 raises the possibility of systemic hypertension.  There is no evidence of
 advanced pulmonary congestive pattern, but a mild degree of upper zone
 re-distribution is identified.  No interstitial or alveolar edema is present
 and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax in
 apical area on frontal view.  Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Borderline heart size with mild degree of chronic pulmonary
 congestion.  No evidence of acute pulmonary or pleural abnormalities.
