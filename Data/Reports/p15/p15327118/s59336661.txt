                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with known pneumonia, not taking medication.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Overall lung volumes are lower than the
 prior examination.  There are increasing bibasilar opacities.  Pleural
 effusions likely exist bilaterally with at least a definite moderate effusion
 on the right.  Opacities may reflect progressive consolidation secondary to
 pneumonia, aspiration, or atelectasis.  Prominence of bronchovascular markings
 may be partly due to lower lung volumes, though superimposed edema is also
 likely.  Assessment of cardiac contours is difficult secondary to bibasilar
 opacities.  No pneumothorax is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:   Increasing bibasilar opacities, likely a combination of
 bilateral effusions and pneumonia.  Opacities could also reflect aspiration or
 atelectasis. Mild superimposed pulmonary edema is also likely.
