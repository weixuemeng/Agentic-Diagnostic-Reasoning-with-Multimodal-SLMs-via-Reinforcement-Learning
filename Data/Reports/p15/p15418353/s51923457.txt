                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with lupus, now presenting with cough and
 fever, here to evaluate for pulmonary pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show development of a
 new right infrahilar opacity from ___ localized within the right lower
 lobe on the corresponding lateral radiograph.  No other focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable right lower lobe pneumonia in the clinical context of
 cough and fever.  However, given the patient's history of lupus, CT may aid
 diagnosis by excluding the possibility of pulmonary nodules, abscess or other
 atypical infection if clinically indicated.
 
 Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ General
 ___ at 14:12 p.m. on ___.
