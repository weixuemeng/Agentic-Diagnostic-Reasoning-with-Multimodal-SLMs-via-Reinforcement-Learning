                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Nausea, abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The chest is
 overall underpenetrated likely due to patient body habitus.  Given this, there
 is slight prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature suggesting mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  No definite focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Previously seen right lower lobe
 consolidation have resolved in the interval.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Previously seen right lower lobe pneumonia has resolved in the
 interval.  Underpenetrated chest likely due to patient body habitus.  Possible
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
