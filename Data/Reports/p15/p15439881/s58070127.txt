 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Rule out chronic heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, but no evidence of pneumonia
 or other acute lung process.  No pulmonary edema.  The hilar and mediastinal
 contours are normal.  A minimally denser band-like lesion in right perihilar
 location is seen on the frontal radiograph only and likely corresponds to a
 combined projection artifact created by an upper lobe vein and the anterior
 margin of the third right rib.
