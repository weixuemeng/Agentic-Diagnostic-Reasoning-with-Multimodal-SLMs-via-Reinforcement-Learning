                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary hypertension.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged,
 though there is no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute
 focal pneumonia.  Specifically, there is no evidence of enlargement of central
 pulmonary arteries that would be a radiographic sign for pulmonary artery
 hypertension.
