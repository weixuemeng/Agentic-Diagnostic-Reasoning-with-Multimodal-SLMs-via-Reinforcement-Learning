                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with ground-glass opacity on CT abdomen/pelvis.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen/pelvis from earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: Two views were obtained of the chest.  Bilateral perihilar
 opacities, more confluent on the left and linear right increased interstitial
 opacities, are concerning for a developing infectious process.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart is normal in size with normal
 cardiomediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION: Bilateral perihilar opacities could reflect developing infectious
 process perhaps due to atypical infectious process.
