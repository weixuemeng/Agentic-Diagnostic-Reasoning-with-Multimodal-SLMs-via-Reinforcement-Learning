 INDICATION:  Chest pressure, radiating to the back, here to evaluate for
 mediastinal widening.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.

 lateral view.  There is anterior eventration of the right greater than the
 left hemidiaphragm, which is unchanged.  The lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is top

 knob.  There is minimal biapical pleural scarring.  Mild degenerative changes
