                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with left-sided deep vein thrombosis. 
 Cough.  Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No typical configurational
 abnormality is identified.  Thoracic aorta mildly widened but no local contour
 abnormalities or wall calcifications are seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not congested.  No evidence of acute parenchymal infiltrates is seen and the
 lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax in the apical
 area on the frontal view.  Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly within
 normal limits.  There exists no prior chest examination or records available
 for comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normal chest findings in this ___-year-old male patient recently
 diagnosed with ultrasound and phlebography for having a posterior tibial vein
 thrombosis.  Although there is no evidence of any pulmonary infarction,
 pleural effusion, or local pulmonary vascular ischemia seen on the plain chest
 examination, this does not rule out the possibility of pulmonary embolism. 
 There exists no prior chest examination or records available for comparison.
