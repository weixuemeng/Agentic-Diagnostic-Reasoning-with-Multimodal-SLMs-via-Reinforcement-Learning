  Prominent interstitial markings throughout both lungs suggestive of chronic
  interstitial lung disease.  Focal opacity in the left lower lobe obscures the
  medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm on the frontal radiograph and overlies
  the posterior aspect of the costophrenic sulcus on the lateral view.  This may
  represent atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.  No pulmonary edema,
  pneumothorax.  Small left pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Aortic stenosis, worsening dyspnea on exertion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from outside hospital, ___, chest CT
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is after sternotomy.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There is no evidence of overt pulmonary edema
 but an increased interstitial fluid is manifested by fluid markings of the
 fissures on the lateral image.  The patient also shows small dorsal pleural
 effusions, limited to the dorsal aspect of the costophrenic sinuses and
 visible on the lateral image only.  Adjacent to the effusions is a small zone
 of parenchymal opacity, that might correspond to the resolving parenchymal
 opacities documented on the CT examination from ___, in the left
 lower lobe.
 
 No new opacities.  The sternal wires show correct alignment.  No pneumothorax.
