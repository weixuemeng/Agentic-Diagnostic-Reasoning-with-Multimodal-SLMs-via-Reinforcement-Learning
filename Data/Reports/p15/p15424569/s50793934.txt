                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, swan ganz  // Innterval change, line
 position      //
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Swan-Ganz catheter and single lead pacemaker are in unchanged and
 appropriate positions.  A right-sided PICC line terminates at least 2 cm in
 the cavoatrial junction, although the tip is obscured. A sternotomy wires are
 well aligned and intact. There is little change in the mild pulmonary edema
 along with a left-sided pleural effusion and atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right-sided PICC terminating in the right ventricle at least 2 cm from the
 cavoatrial junction. A lateral or PA view of the film may help determine with
 the tip position to measure of the distance of retraction necessary for low
 SVC placement.
 2. Unchanged mild pulmonary edema, left sided pleural effusion and
 atelectasis.
