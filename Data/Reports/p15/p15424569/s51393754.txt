  worsening pulmonary edema. Lung volumes are low. Bibasilar opacities may
  represent atelectasis or small effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, worsening dyspnea on exertion  //
 Evaluate for pulmonary edema, infection
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. 
 There are signs of mild to moderate pulmonary edema, associated to areas of
 consolidation at both lung bases, left more than right, as well as blunting of
 the left costophrenic sinus, likely caused by a small pleural effusion. 
 Coexisting pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
 Unchanged position of the left pectoral pacemaker, unchanged alignment of the
 sternal wires.
