 consolidation, with slightly better aeration.  There is minimal blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle, similar to the prior film. There may be some
 increased atelectasis at the right base.   There is upper zone redistribution
 and mild vascular plethora. Lateral view shows small right and
 small-to-moderate left pleural effusions. 
 
 Right IJ central line tip over distal SVC, similar to prior.
