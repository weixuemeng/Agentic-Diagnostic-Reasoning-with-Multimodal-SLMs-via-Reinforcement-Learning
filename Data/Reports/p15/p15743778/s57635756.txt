                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Lung volumes are low resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding.  No overt interstitial edema is identified, though
 there may be a touch of vascular congestion.  There is no large pleural
 effusion.  No confluent consolidation or pneumothorax is evident.  Mediastinal
 contours appear mildly widened, though hypodense, findings suggestive of
 mediastinal lipomatosis.  There is mild cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes, though no consolidation or pleural effusion
 2.  No pathologic mediastinal widening
 3.  Mild cardiomegaly
