                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Bright red blood per rectum, history of
 alcohol/hepatitis C cirrhosis, slightly altered mental status, elevated white
 blood cell count, no cough, no fever, chills.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  On the frontal view, the right costophrenic
 angle is not fully included.  There may be very trace pleural effusions with
 overlying atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right costophrenic angle not fully included on the frontal image.
 Low lung volumes, difficult to exclude trace pleural effusions.  No definite
 focal consolidation.
