 HISTORY:  Wheezing, question cardiopulmonary process.

 Moderate cardiomegaly is more pronounced and mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is stable or slightly increased as well.  There is no pulmonary
 edema or focal pulmonary abnormality, with particular attention to the
 symptomatic region, the left lower lobe, except for what looks like a very
 small region of atelectasis.  Left lower costal pleural thickening is
 unchanged.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion.  The patient had a
 resection of the left seventh rib.  This study is not designed for assessment
 of the spinal stabilization device, whose large elements are grossly intact.
 
 No pneumothorax.
