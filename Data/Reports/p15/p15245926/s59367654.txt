                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and multifocal pneumonia, assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph is obtained.  Right PICC is
 unchanged in the upper SVC.  Multifocal right-sided pulmonary opacities are
 unchanged from the prior examination.  The left lung remains well aerated. 
 Right pleural effusion is likely present.  The heart remains at the upper
 limits of normal with tortuous aortic contour.  Spinal hardware is
 incompletely assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged multifocal right-sided pulmonary opacities consistent
 with multifocal pneumonia and likely accompanying effusion.
