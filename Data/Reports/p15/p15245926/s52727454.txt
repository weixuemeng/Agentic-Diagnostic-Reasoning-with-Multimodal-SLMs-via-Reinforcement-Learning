                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left scapular pain and recent fall and
 altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are poorly expanded, accounting for bronchovascular
 crowding.  Some bibasilar atelectasis is present, but there is no definite
 focal consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Severe degenerative changes of the right
 shoulder are re-demonstrated.  
 
 This study is underpenetrated and suboptiaml for assessment of bony
 structures.  Spinal fixation rods and screws are present, without evidence of
 hardware-related complication.  A left-sided PICC line has been removed in the
 interval. There are likely degenerative changes at the right shoulder, not
 well assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 process.  If concern for scapular or other fracture, recommend dedicated
 imaging of the site.
