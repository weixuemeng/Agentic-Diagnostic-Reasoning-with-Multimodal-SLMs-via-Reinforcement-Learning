                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with elevated ESR and CRP.
 
 CHEST, AP:  Left PICC has been removed.  Lung volumes are low.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is stable.  There is increased central venous congestion and
 probable mild interstitial edema.  There are no definite pleural effusions
 although the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film.  Chronic
 comminuted glenohumeral fracture is better evaluated on accompanying CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
