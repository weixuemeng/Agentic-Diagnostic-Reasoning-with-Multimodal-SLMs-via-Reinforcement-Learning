                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:01 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with an acute cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 The lungs are grossly clear, but conventional radiography is more sensitive
 for detection of pulmonary infection, particularly in the lower lobes,
 compared to bedside radiography.  Upper lungs are clear, cardiomediastinal and
 hilar silhouettes are normal and there is no indication of pleural effusion. 
 No free subdiaphragmatic gas.  Markers of chemoembolization in the liver
 should not be mistaken for pulmonary pathology.
