                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with history of alcoholism with cough and sputum,
 assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are somewhat low in volume but clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified, though the inferior aspect of
 right pleural sulcus is excluded on the lateral view and the extreme left
 pleural sulcus is excluded on the frontal view.  The heart is likely normal in
 size allowing for AP technique. A stable convex bulge of the right mediastinum
 likely reflect a stable mildly dilated or tortuous ascending aorta.  Surgical
 clips are seen in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process, with stable mild ascending aortic
 dilatation or tortuousity.
