                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male presenting with alcohol withdrawal seizure.  Assess
 for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 
 The lung volumes are low.  Subtle linear opacities in the lung bases are
 likely related to atelectasis.  However, there is also increased density
 overlying the lower thoracic spine on the lateral view and the possibility of
 a focus of aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 
 No CHF, effusion, or pneumothorax.  
 
 The heart is not enlarged. The thoracic aorta follows a tortuous course. 
 Right paratracheal opacity likely represents vascular structures, accentuated
 by slight patient rotation and other technical factors.  Surgical clips are
 visualized within the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Bibasilar atelectasis. 
 2) Increased density overlying the lower thoracic spine on the lateral view --
 aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded.
