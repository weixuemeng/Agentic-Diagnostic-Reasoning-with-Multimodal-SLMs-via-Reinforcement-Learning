                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post revision of
 hepaticojejunostomy, now with shortness of breath, evaluate for possible
 pulmonary process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding PA and lateral chest examination ___ ___.  The heart
 size has increased, but may be accentuated by the AP frontal portable chest
 technique.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature appears
 more congested with perivascular haze, crowded appearance on the bases.  On
 the left base in retrocardiac position, there are some linear densities
 obliterating the diaphragmatic contour and that of the lower descending
 thoracic aorta suggestive of either right atelectasis or possible pulmonary
 infiltrate.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Congested pulmonary vasculature and atelectasis on left base,
 pulmonary infiltrates cannot be excluded.  It is recommended to have a
 followup examination with short interval preferentially frontal and lateral
 view to better delineate the described basal chest findings.
