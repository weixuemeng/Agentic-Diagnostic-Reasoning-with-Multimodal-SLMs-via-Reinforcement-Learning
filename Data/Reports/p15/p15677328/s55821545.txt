                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status after fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Low lung volumes are
 present with patchy opacities in the lung bases most likely reflective of
 atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities identified. No displaced rib fractures are
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities most likely reflective of atelectasis in
 this setting of low lung volumes. No displaced fractures identified. If there
 is continued concern for a rib fracture, consider a dedicated rib series.
