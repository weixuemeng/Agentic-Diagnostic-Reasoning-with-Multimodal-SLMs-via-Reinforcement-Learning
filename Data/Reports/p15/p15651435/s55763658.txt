                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough  // cough r/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  There is suture material
 seen in the anterior left lower lobe as well as increased opacity immediately
 adjacent to the surgical chain sutures, likely due to postoperative scarring.
 There is geographically marginated fibrosis in the upper lobes with bilateral
 upper lobe volume loss.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  
 Surgical clips are seen in the left upper abdomen and in the abdomen along the
 midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased opacity immediately adjacent to the surgical chain sutures in the
 anterior left lower lobe, most likely due to postoperative scarring.
 Short-term followup could be obtained if clinically indicated to exclude a
 pneumonia, especially in the absence of older CXR for comparison.
 2. Geographically marginated fibrosis in the upper lobes with bilateral upper
 lobe volume loss consistent with previous radiation therapy.
