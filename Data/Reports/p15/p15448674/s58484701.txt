                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were reviewed.  Again seen is mild
 cardiomegaly with mitral annular calcifications.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.
 Chronic parenchymal changes are seen. Bibasilar opacities may reflect
 atelectasis. There is very mild congestion. Degenerative changes are seen in
 the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities, which may represent
 atelectasis.  Infection is not excluded.
