                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with progressive supranuclear palsy, presenting with
 productive cough and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The study is limited due to body habitus and positioning. Lung
 volumes are low accounting for bronchovascular crowding.  Bibasilar streaky
 opacities suggest atelectasis.  Increased interstitial opacities are seen, but
 there are no focal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.  Cardiac size is
 moderately enlarged, although assessment is limited due to low lung volumes
 and AP projection. Mitral anular calcifications are redemonstrated. There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes. Interstitial edema but no definite evidence of
 pneumonia.
