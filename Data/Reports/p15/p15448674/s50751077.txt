                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Follow-up of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___, and chest CT studies from
 ___, and ___.    
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The arms are down and accordingly the lateral view is
 underpenetrated and markedly limited.  Dense mitral calcifications are
 present.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A
 diffuse interstitial abnormality has considerably improved.  A streaky left
 basilar opacities in the left lower lobe is associated with clustered small
 dilated airways.  Small pleural effusions are suspected.  With resolution of
 more widespread opacification, mild peripheral interstitial changes are more
 apparent in relative terms and unchanged from earlier.  Degenerative changes
 of the spine appear similar.  Moderate-to-severe degenerative changes involve
 each shoulder as before.  The bones are probably demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving interstitial abnormality.  Patchy left basilar
 opacification with potential pleural effusion.  This latter opacity component
 appears more chronic, although perhaps recently increased somewhat in the
 recent past; waxing and waning atelectasis is favored.
