                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Diffuse rhonchi and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Mitral annular calcifications are present. 
 The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The aortic arch is partly
 calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle suggests a small effusion.  There is
 mild-to-moderate interstitial abnormality suggesting pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  The bones appear demineralized.  Moderate degenerative changes
 are noted along each shoulder.  Mild degenerative changes and slightly
 exaggerated lordotic curvature are present throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate interstitial abnormality most suggestive of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
