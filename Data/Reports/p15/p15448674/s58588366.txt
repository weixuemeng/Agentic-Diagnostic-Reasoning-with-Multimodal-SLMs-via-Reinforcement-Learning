                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:12 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to chest radiograph and CTA ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly.  Moderate right basal atelectasis are unchanged.  There
 is no evidence of pneumonia or acute cardiac decompensation, although azygos
 vein is distended.  Mitral annulus is very heavily calcified, sometimes
 contributing to mitral regurgitation.  COPD is clearly demonstrated on the
 chest CTA, not as obvious on conventional radiographs.
