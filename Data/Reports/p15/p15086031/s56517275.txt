                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with chest pain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lungs fully expanded and clear.  Heart size normal.  Thoracic aorta very
 tortuous but not clearly aneurysmal.  Mediastinum otherwise unremarkable. 
 Hila not enlarged.
 
 Ribbon-like deformities of three right middle ribs posteriorly include
 indentations on the upper margins of the ribs, rather than the undersides
 generally seen with multiple neuromas.  I suspect this is dysplasia, but if
 the patient has skin nodules or other stigmata, the diagnosis of
 neurofibromatosis should be considered.  One skin nodule is seen in the right
 supraclavicular region and another laterally at the level of the eighth rib. 
 Clinical correlation advised.
