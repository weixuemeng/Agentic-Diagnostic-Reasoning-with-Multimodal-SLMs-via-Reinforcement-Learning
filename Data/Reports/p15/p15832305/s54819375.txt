                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with type b dissection  // decreased hct
 
 COMPARISON:  Scout image CT torso ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Dilated descending thoracic aorta is similar in appearance to ___
 scout image, and a moderate to large left pleural effusion is probably similar
 to the transverse CT images, but difficult to accurately compare by volume due
 to modality differences. If precise comparison is deemed warranted clinically,
 CT would be more sensitive for detecting changes.  Adjacent left lower lobe
 atelectasis is present.
