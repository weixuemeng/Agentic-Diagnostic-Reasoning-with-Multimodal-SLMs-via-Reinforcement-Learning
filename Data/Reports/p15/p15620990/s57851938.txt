                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Strep viridans endocarditis.  Low-grade fever.  Suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 A handful of small, round, and elongated opacities at the periphery of the
 right lung, presumed septic emboli, are grossly unchanged since ___, but similar lesions on the left are larger and more numerous than they
 were on ___, raising concern for continued septic embolization.  Heart
 size is normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is minimally engorged, and there is no
 edema or pleural effusion.  Care should be taken to follow up this examination
 with routine (PA and lateral) chest radiographs rather than bedside frontal
 views alone, in hopes of being accurate about the profusion of new presumed
 septic emboli.  If that will not be possible, I would recommend low-dose
 non-contrast CT scanning of the chest for surveillance.
 
 Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC.
