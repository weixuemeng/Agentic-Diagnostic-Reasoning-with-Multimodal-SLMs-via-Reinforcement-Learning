                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative MVR.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 slightly better inspiration.  Continued opacification is seen at the bases,
 consistent with atelectasis and effusion.  Scattered streaks of atelectasis
 are seen in the more superior portions of the lungs.  There is a small area of
 increased opacification just above the minor fissure on the right, which could
 reflect a developing focus of consolidation.
 
 Left PICC line remains in place.
