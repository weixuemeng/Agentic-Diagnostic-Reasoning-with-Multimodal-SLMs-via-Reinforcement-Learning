 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left pigtail pleural catheter remains in place.  Moderate-to-large
 left pleural effusion has increased in size in the interval with adjacent
 atelectasis of the left mid and lower lung regions.  Within the right
 hemithorax, a small pleural effusion is unchanged, and there remains a focal
 linear area of atelectasis at the right base.
