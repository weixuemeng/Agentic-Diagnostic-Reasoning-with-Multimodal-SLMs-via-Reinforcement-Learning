                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer with a left
 Pleurx catheter.  Presenting with decreased drainage.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT of the chest from ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral veiws of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is new complete opacification of the left hemithorax with
 slight rightward shift of the trachea and mediastinum.  This is most
 consistent with a new large left pleural effusion.  A left Pleurx catheter tip
 appears in unchanged position overlying the left lower lung zone.  The
 catheter itself appears intact.  There is a small right pleural effusion,
 which is unchanged.  The right lung is clear without a consolidation or
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not well evaluated due
 to the left hemithorax opacification.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New complete opacification of the left hemithorax with rightward
 shift of the mediastinum due to reaccumulation of a large left pleural
 effusion.
