                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:53 P.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma and recent
 thyroidectomy.  Left pleural effusion is malignant.  Recent TPA with an acute
 increase in bloody drainage.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Left pigtail pleural drainage catheter is still in place, low in the left
 hemithorax, following drainage of a substantial volume of previous large left
 pleural effusion.  There is only small volume of residual effusion and
 thickening of the pleura, but no pneumothorax.  Apparent widening of the
 mediastinal contour in the region of the pulmonary outflow tract could be
 loculated pleural fluid.  It is not where I would expect to see changes of
 aortic aneurysm or acute dissection.  If it persists, I would recommend CT
 scanning to confirm that it is nothing more than residual pleural loculation. 
 The upper lungs show mild vascular engorgement.  Heart size is normal.  Small
 right pleural effusion has decreased since earlier on ___ also.
