                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Thyroid cancer, pleural effusion, status post chest tube
 placement, now with hypoxia and dyspnea, assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.  Left basally directed chest
 tube appears unchanged in position.  The extent of pleural effusion assuming
 similar degrees of inclination is mildly increased with resultant, likely
 chronic, left lower lobe atelectasis.  Effusion remains significantly
 decreased from pre-chest tube placement film on ___.  The right
 lung is clear.  Cardiomediastinal contours are obscured but unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval increase in moderate left pleural effusion and
 atelectasis.
