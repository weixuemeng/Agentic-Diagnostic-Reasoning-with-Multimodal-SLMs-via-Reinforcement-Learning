                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a pigtail catheter projecting
 over the lateral lower left hemithorax, with interval increase in aeration of
 the left upper lung, although with still a very large amount of pleural fluid
 remaining.  The left chest tube catheter appears somewhat low in position and
 this was discussed with Dr. ___ at 3:48 p.m. on ___ via
 telephone.  Opacity along the left aspect of the mediastinum may relate to
 known extensive lymphadenopathy.  A trace right pleural effusion remains.  The
 trachea is significantly less shifted as compared to the prior study and is
 now closer to midline.
