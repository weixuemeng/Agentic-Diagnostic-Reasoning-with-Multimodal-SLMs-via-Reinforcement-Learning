                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute onset of slurred speech, weakness and confusion, here to
 evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available at this time.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs appear slightly hyperinflated with flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms and a barrel-shaped chest on the lateral radiograph, which is
 due in part to kyphotic curvature of the spine.  No focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in
 size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is
 generalized loss of height of several thoracic vertebral bodies with a slight
 anterior wedge compression deformity of a mid to lower vertebral body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs and barrel
 shape of the chest is due in part to kyphotic curvature of the spine.
 2.  Generalized loss of vertebral body height in the thoracic spine with mild
 anterior wedge compression deformity of a mid-to-lower thoracic vertebral
 body.
