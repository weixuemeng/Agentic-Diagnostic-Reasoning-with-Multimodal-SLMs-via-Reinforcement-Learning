 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:32 AM
  Dense opacity at the cardiac apex extending the lateral chest wall is
  concerning for hemothorax given the interval change and reported history of
  mechanical fall.  Alternatively, this may be related to changes in patient
  positioning and a large pericardial fat pad. Recommend repeat upright PA and
  lateral chest radiographs for further evaluation.  If the patient is acutely
  hypotensive, CT should be considered.

 WET READ VERSION #___ ___ ___ 6:28 AM
  Dense opacity at the cardiac apex extending the lateral chest wall may reflect
  a large pericardial fat pad imaged differently given this supine projection
  compared to the upright projection obtained 1 day prior.  However this is also
  concerning for new, acute pleural effusion and hemothorax given the reported
  history of mechanical fall.  Recommend repeat upright PA and lateral chest
  radiographs for further evaluation.  If the patient is acutely hypotensive, CT
  could be considered.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Medial left basilar opacity may reflect prominent para-aortic fat, a large
 pericardial fat pad, or atelectasis.  New, dense opacification at the cardiac
 apex extending to the lateral chest wall likely reflects a new pleural
 effusion or a large fat pad given differences in patient positioning.  No
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Dense opacity at the cardiac apex extending the lateral chest wall is
 concerning for hemothorax given the interval change and reported history of
 mechanical fall.  Alternatively, this may be related to changes in patient
 positioning and a large pericardial fat pad.  Recommend repeat upright PA and
 lateral chest radiographs for further evaluation.  If the patient is acutely
 hypotensive, CT should be considered.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Dense opacity at the cardiac apex extending the lateral
 chest wall is concerning for hemothorax given the interval change and reported
 history of mechanical fall.  Alternatively, this may be related to changes in
 patient positioning and a large pericardial fat pad. Recommend repeat upright
 PA and lateral chest radiographs for further evaluation.  If the patient is
 acutely hypotensive, CT should be considered.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 6:25 AM, approximately
 60 minutes after discovery of the findings.
