                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain, cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to prior exam
 from ___.  The lungs are slightly hyperinflated.  There are
 several areas of patchy and nodular opacities identified in the right mid and
 lower lung, not clearly delineated on the lateral view.  Left lung is grossly
 clear.  There is no effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in
 size.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy nodular opacities in the right lung.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, these could be related to infection in which case repeat
 after treatment to document resolution is advised.  However, if symptoms not
 present, additional imaging with CT is suggested.
