                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring
 and support devices have been removed.  Little change in the diffuse bilateral
 pulmonary opacifications.  Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm suggests
 some possible layering effusion and basilar atelectasis.
