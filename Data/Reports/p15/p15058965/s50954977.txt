 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of Swan-Ganz catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no change in
 appearance of the Swan-Ganz catheter.  Also, the endotracheal tube and the
 nasogastric tube are constant in appearance.  The lung volumes have minimally
 increased, potentially reflecting an increase in ventilatory pressures.  The
 pre-existing parenchymal opacities are unchanged in extent and severity.
