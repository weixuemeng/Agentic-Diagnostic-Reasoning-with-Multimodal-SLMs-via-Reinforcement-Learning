                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post cardiac arrest, evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position 5.4 cm from the
 carina.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of field
 of view.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is present, and since the prior exam, the tip
 is now pointing left toward, likely into the left main pulmonary artery.
 
 The opacities in the right upper lobe, and to a less extent, in the left upper
 lobe are more discrete appearing, suggesting the presence of pneumonia.  There
 is still mild edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The opacities in the upper lobes appear more discrete suggesting the
 presence of pneumonia.
 2.  The Swan-Ganz catheter tip is now pointing leftward, likely in the
 proximal left main pulmonary artery.
