                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:53 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with PEA arrest.  ECMO discontinued.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 11:45 a.m.:
 
 Since ___:45 a.m., mild pulmonary edema has worsened in the right and mid and
 upper zones of the left lung.  There has been a substantial increase in
 consolidation at the base of the left lung which could be dependent edema or
 concurrent pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Small pleural effusions are
 presumed, but not substantial.  There is no pneumothorax.  Swan-Ganz pulmonary
 artery catheter ends in the region of the pulmonic valve, as before.  ET tube
 is in standard placement.  Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper
 stomach but would need to be advanced at least 5 cm to move all the side ports
 beyond the GE junction.
