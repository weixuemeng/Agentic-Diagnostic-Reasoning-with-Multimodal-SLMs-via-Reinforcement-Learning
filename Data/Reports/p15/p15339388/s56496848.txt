 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Patient persistently rotated to
 the right.  Subtle opacity at the right lung base is concerning for pneumonia.
 Left lung appears largely clear.  No large effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited due to patient rotation.  Subtle opacity in the right lower lung is
 potentially concerning for pneumonia.  Dedicated PA and lateral views would be
 helpful to confirm.
