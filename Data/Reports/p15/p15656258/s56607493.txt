  Since the most recent examination, there is progressive diffuse, patchy
  opacity involving the entire right hemithorax.  More patchy, predominantly
  basilar opacities are also noted on the left in comparison most recent
  examination.  Etiology is unclear.  Likely bilateral pleural effusions are
  present.  No pneumothorax is identified.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lung cancer p/w respiratory failure  //
 interval changes in right lung      interval changes in right lung
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again diffuse patchy
 opacification involving the right hemithorax with 8 generalized haziness, most
 likely representing layering pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis and
 continued mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  The large spiculated
 mass is again seen in the right perihilar region.  Again, CT would be
 necessary for further characterization of this process.
