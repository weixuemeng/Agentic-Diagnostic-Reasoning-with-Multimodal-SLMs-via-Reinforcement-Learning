                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with CNS lymphoma, recent deep vein
 thrombosis with pulmonary embolism and pneumonia, evaluate for effusions
 before high-dose MTX used, any interval change?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.  Unchanged appearance and location of
 previously described left-sided Port-A-Cath system terminating within the
 upper third of the right atrium.  Heart size unchanged.  No significant
 interval changes in mediastinal structures.  The on previous chest examination
 identified and suspected early pneumonic infiltrates in right infrahilar and
 lower lobe position are less prominent but some residuals exist.  Similarly,
 some hazy densities in the left lower lobe persist and appear to be stable
 when comparison is made with the previous study.  No new acute parenchymal
 infiltrates are seen.  There is no pneumothorax in the apical area.  The
 lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.  
 
 The patient underwent a chest CT angiogram during the latest examination
 interval on ___, this procedure is also reviewed.  There was
 evidence of multiple mostly peripherally located pulmonary emboli in the
 pulmonary circulation laterally as well as multiple ground-glass densities
 scattered in both lungs.  These densities most likely accounted for the
 abnormalities present on the previous chest PA and lateral.  Comparison thus
 states that these abnormalities have regressed at the present time. 
 Obviously, the PA and lateral chest examination cannot demonstrate the lesions
 seen on CTA in same detail.
