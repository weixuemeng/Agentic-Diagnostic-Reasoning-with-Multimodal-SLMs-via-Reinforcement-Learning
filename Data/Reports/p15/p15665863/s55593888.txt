                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumothorax with agitation on ventilator.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the degree of
 pulmonary edema has slightly improved.  There is the vague suggestion of some
 increased opacification more focally at the right base.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, supervening aspiration could be considered.  Specifically,
 no convincing evidence of pneumothorax or deep sulcus sign on the left.
