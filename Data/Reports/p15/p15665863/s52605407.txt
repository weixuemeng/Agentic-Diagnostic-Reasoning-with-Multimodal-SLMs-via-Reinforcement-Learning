                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with concern for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest was obtained (semi-erect).
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 PICC line ends at the distal SVC. Small bilateral effusion and small effusion
 in the right minor fissure are stable.
 The right perihilar opacity has improved, the diffuse left lung alveolar
 ground glass opacities have worsened. Given the quick improvement of the right
 opacity, and the more symmetric perihilar diffuse pattern, pulmonary edema is
 the most likely diagnosis, however, a superimposed multifocal pneumonia cannot
 be excluded.
