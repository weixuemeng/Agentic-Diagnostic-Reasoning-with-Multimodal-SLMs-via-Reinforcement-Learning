                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and desaturation after extubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there are again
 diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, though the degree of aeration is
 slightly improved and the vascular congestion appears to be slightly less
 prominent.
