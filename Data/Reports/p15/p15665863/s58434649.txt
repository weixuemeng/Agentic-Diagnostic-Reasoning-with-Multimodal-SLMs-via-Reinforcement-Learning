                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Lower extremity swelling.  Assess for cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  Lung
 volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of
 the pulmonary vasculature.  There is subsegmental left lower lung atelectasis.
 There is also minimal right lower lung atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  The heart size is top
 normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  Note is made of a small left
 pleural effusion, best seen on the lateral projection.  No definite right
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small left pleural effusion with subsegmental left lower lung atelectasis.
 
 2.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
