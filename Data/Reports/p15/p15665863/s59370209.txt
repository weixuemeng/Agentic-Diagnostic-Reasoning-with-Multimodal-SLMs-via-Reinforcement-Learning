                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ at 18:32
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cirrhosis and recent respiratory
 failure, now with increasing oxygen requirement, question interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to patient's prior study of ___ at 4:14 a.m.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 18:32 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line unchanged in position.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  There continues to be bilateral diffuse
 airspace process with more focal consolidative appearance in the right lower
 lobe.  Although this could represent severe pulmonary edema, multifocal
 pneumonia would be of concern given the areas of focality in the right lower
 lung.   When compared to the most recent comparison study from ___,
 there is no significant interval change, although clearly the airspace process
 has progressed since ___.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax. Lucency
 overlying the left neck soft tissues and extending into the left superior
 mediastinum is felt to represent air within the esophagus given patient
 rotation on the current examination.
