                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bilateral granulomatous uveitis, rule out sarcoid.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the hilar structures have
 increased in diameter.  This increase is more noticeable on the right than on
 the left.  In addition, a zone of micronodules is seen in the perihilar areas
 on the right and, very subtle, on the left.  Altogether, the findings are
 consistent with pulmonary sarcoidosis.
 
 No evidence of other lung changes.  No pleural effusions.  Normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette.
