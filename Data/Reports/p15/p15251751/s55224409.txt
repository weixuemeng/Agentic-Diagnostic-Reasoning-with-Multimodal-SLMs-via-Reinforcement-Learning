                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Outside hospital, chronic heart failure, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient now has a
 correctly positioned right-sided PICC line in addition to the left pectoral
 Port-A-Cath.  The technical quality of the examination is limited, given the
 body habitus of the patient.  There is moderate cardiomegaly and likely
 presence of mild pulmonary edema.  Larger parenchymal consolidations and
 pleural effusions are not seen on the image.
