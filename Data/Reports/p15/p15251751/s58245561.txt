                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with worsening dyspnea, known heart failure; also
 sputum production.  Question worsening fluid overload versus pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were compared to previous
 exam from ___.
 
 Right PICC is seen with tip in the upper SVC.  Dual-lead pacing device again
 seen with coronary sinus and right ventricular leads.  Indistinct pulmonary
 vascular markings seen bilaterally suggesting component of interstitial edema.
 There is still persistent basilar opacity on the lateral view, suggesting
 atelectasis; however, superimposed infection is not excluded.  Cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged, but stable.
 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged, noting hypertrophic changes
 in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of interstitial edema with basilar opacity in
 the lateral view, potentially due to atelectasis; however, infection is not
 completely excluded.
