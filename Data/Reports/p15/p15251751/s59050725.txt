                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates interval placement of
 a new right PICC with tip in the upper SVC.  A left pectoral dual-lead cardiac
 pacer/AICD has leads terminating in the coronary sinus and right ventricle,
 unchanged.  Compared to preceding exam, there has been interval improvement of
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly prominent but is
 likely accentuated by AP technique.  Allowing for patient rotation, the
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The lungs appear
 relatively well aerated.  There is no confluent consolidation or large
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No definite evidence to suggest pneumonia.
 2.  Interval improvement of pulmonary edema since ___.
 3.  Interval placement of a new right PICC.
