                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with multiple medical problems including
 diastolic heart failure, status post diuresis, here to evaluate for interval
 changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show a left pectoral
 dual-lead pacemaker with two leads terminating in the right ventricle and left
 ventricle, unchanged.  A right-sided PICC line has been slightly withdrawn
 since ___, with the tip now terminating at the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic vein which should be advanced 6 cm to place in the low SVC. 
 Mild pulmonary edema is improved and nearly resolved from ___. 
 Opacification at the right medial lung base on the frontal radiograph and
 posterior lower lung on the corresponding lateral radiograph is consistent
 with right lower lobe atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with mild
 cardiomegaly.  Calcification of the mitral valve annulus is noted.  There is
 generalized loss of vertebral height and severe degenerative changes with
 bridging osteophyte formation in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right lower lobe atelectasis.
 2.  Improved and nearly resolved mild pulmonary edema ___.
 3.  Right PICC line with tip slightly withdrawn, at the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic veins, needs to be advanced 6 cm to place in the low SVC.
 4.  Stable cardiomegaly.
