 FINDINGS:  AP and two lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.  The

 these limitations, there is increased pulmonary vascular congestion and
 indistinctness of the hila.  Right lower lobe atelectasis is similar. 
 Dual-lead pacemaker leads are in stable position of the chest. The aortic arch
 is calcified.  Severe cardiomegaly is similar.  No effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema.
