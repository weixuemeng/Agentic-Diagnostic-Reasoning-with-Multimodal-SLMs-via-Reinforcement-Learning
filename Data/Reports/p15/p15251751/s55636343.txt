                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Permanent pacemaker remains in place with one lead overlying the
 right ventricle and the second placed for biventricular pacing.  Cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged and accompanied by upper zone vascular redistribution,
 but previously present interstitial edema has resolved.  Opacity at right
 cardiophrenic angle is unchanged since older studies and corresponds to an
 enlarged right pericardial fat pad on prior CTA of the chest of ___,
 with associated linear scar in the right middle lobe.  However, on the lateral
 view, apparently new area of opacity overlies the lower thoracic spine, and is
 difficult to localize on the frontal radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved CHF with resolution of interstitial edema.
 2.  Lower lobe opacity posteriorly on lateral view, which could represent a
 focal basilar pneumonia, atelectasis or aspiration.  Followup chest x-ray may
 be helpful in this regard if warranted clinically.
