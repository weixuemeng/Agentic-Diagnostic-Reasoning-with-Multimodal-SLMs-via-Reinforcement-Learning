                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough for one week, left lower
 lobe rhonchi.  Study requested for evaluation of abnormalities.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 There is peribronchial thickening in the right lower lobe, likely related to a
 chronic, nonacute inflammatory change. Dense right apical thickening likely
 represents pleural calcification.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Visualized osseous structures
 are grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.
 Peribronchial thickening in right lower lobe, likely represents a chronic,
 non-acute airway inflammation.
