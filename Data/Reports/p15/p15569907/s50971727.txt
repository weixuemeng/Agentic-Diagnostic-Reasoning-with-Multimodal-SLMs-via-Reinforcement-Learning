                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p intubation  // ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube tip is 5.1 cm from the carina.  There is a left basilar opacity
 silhouetting the hemidiaphragm.  Elsewhere, lungs are essentially clear
 besides left basilar atelectasis.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. 
 Increased soft tissue density projecting over the AP window is compatible with
 patient's known dissection with mediastinal hematoma.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, potentially due to a
 combination of atelectasis and/or effusion.
 Abnormal mediastinal contour compatible with patient's known mediastinal
 hematoma in setting of aortic dissection.
