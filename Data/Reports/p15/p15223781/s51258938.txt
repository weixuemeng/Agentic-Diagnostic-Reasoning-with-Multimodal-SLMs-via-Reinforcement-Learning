                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with AML, receiving chemotherapy, now with
 low-grade temperature.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  A new opacity is noted in the left
 costophrenic angle.  No other focal opacities are noted bilaterally. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There has been interval removal of a left-sided
 subclavian line with an interval placement of a tunnel trialysis line that
 ends in the lower SVC.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  New opacity in the left costophrenic angle is compatible with
 left lower lobe pneumonia.
