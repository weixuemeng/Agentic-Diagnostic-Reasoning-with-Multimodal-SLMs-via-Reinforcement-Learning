 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chemotherapy, fever, question pneumonia.

 consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  A rounded nodular hyperdensity
 projecting over the left lower lobe is most compatible with a calcified
 granuloma.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
