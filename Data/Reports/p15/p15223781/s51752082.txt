                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough, sinus pain, persistent
 fever despite three days' antibiotics, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is normal.  No
 configurational abnormality is identified. Unremarkable appearance of thoracic
 aorta and no evidence of mediastinal abnormalities.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are
 present.  Diaphragms are relatively low positioned and somewhat flattened, a
 finding suggestive of COPD.  Acute parenchymal infiltrates, however, cannot be
 identified.  Slightly accentuated kyphotic curvature of the thoracic spine on
 the lateral view with moderate degree of degenerative changes, but no evidence
 of significant vertebral body compression fracture.  
 
 Comparison with the next preceding chest examination demonstrates stable
 findings, thus no evidence of new acute infiltrates. Finding of low positioned
 diaphragms related to COPD existed already on previous examination.  Referring
 physician ___, ___ number ___ was paged at 2:55 p.m.
