 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior study there is no substantial change in the bilateral small
 pleural effusions with may be potential minimal decrease in the size.
 
 A left basal opacity has developed in the interim with the sites most likely
 consistent with area of rounded atelectasis although theoretically infectious
 process cannot be excluded. Upper lungs are clear. Heart size and mediastinum
 are stable due to there is no pneumothorax.
