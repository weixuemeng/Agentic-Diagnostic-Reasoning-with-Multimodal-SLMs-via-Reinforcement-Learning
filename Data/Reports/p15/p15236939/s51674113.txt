                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:29 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with stroke.  Check baseline fluid status and
 heart size.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Interval increase in caliber of both the cardiac and vascular portions of the
 mediastinum suggests volume overload, although there is no pulmonary edema as
 yet or appreciable pleural effusion.  Infrahilar opacification is symmetric,
 probably atelectasis.  Aspiration needs to be considered as a contributing
 cause.
