                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post intubation, assess tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  From 50 minutes prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is in the mid trachea, 6 cm above the carina
 and should not be withdrawn any further.  The post-pneumonectomy changes with
 opacification of the right hemithorax with volume loss are unchanged with left
 basal opacity compatible with pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory position of endotracheal tube with findings of left
 basal pneumonia.
