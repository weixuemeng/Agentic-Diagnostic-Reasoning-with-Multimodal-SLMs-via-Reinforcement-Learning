                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath and fever, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright radiograph of the chest was obtained.  New
 opacity seen in the left base is compatible with a pneumonia.  Opacification
 of the right hemithorax is compatible with history of pneumonectomy and
 resultant rightward shift of mediastinal structures.  Cardiac silhouette is
 not well evaluated.  Accompanying left pleural effusion may be present.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basal pneumonia.  Followup radiograph four weeks after
 treatment is recommended.
