                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aorta is
 partly calcified with minimal unfolding.  Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  The lungs appear clear aside from streaky left
 basilar opacities most suggestive of minor atelectasis or perhaps scarring. 
 The lateral view, however shows a posterior opacity, compatible with
 atelectasis although infection is not excluded.  The bones appear likely
 demineralized with mild-to-moderate degenerative changes along the
 mid-to-lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity which is compatible with atelectasis
 although infection is difficult to completely exclude.
