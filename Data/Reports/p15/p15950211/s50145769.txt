                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Increasing weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is a moderate hiatal hernia
 with an air-fluid level.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 aside from the fact that the hiatal hernia was quite small before in
 retrospect, so it may be partly reducible.  The lungs appear clear.  There are
 no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate hiatal hernia.  No evidence of acute disease.
