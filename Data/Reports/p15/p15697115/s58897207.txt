                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NGT in assess placement  // please assess
 for NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 17:43
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The enteric tube terminates in the body of the stomach.  Median sternotomy
 wires are intact.
 
 Bronchovascular markings are exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Dense left
 retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis, slightly increased from
 the earlier study.  No other consolidation.  There is a layering small pleural
 effusion on the left.  No pleural effusion on the right.  A portion of the
 left lung apex is not captured on the current study.  Accounting for this,
 there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Stable cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Enteric tube terminates in the body of the stomach.
 2. Increased left retrocardiac atelectasis, and stable left pleural effusion.
