                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p arrest and s/p chest tube placement for
 pneumo  // eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___, as well as
 multiple prior portable AP chest x-rays from the ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube is seen terminating 4.7 cm above the carina. There is again seen an NG
 tube with distal tip projecting below lower limit of film. A right-sided IJ
 central line is seen in essentially stable position projecting over the mid
 SVC.
 
 There is a stable left-sided chest tube, however despite this the left
 pneumothorax has redeveloped a large apical component, which now measures 5.9
 cm from the apex of lung to apical chest wall.  Despite differences in
 technique/patient positioning in comparison to prior radiographs, this is
 almost certainly significantly increased in size.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are normal. The bilateral hila are normal.
 
 There is increased opacification of most of the left lung due to relaxation
 atelectasis in the setting of left pneumothorax. There may be a small left
 pleural effusion.
 
 The right lung appears well aerated without evidence of focal consolidation.
 There is no right pleural effusion or right pneumothorax. There is no evidence
 of pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Redevelopment of left apical pneumothorax. Secondary relaxation atelectasis of
 most of left lung.  Possible small left pleural effusion.  Otherwise no
 significant interval changes.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were discussed over the phone by Dr. ___
 with Dr. ___ on ___ at 10:55.
