                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A large left pneumothorax is in retrospect similar to the prior
 study.  The pneumothorax is most pronounced in the left costophrenic angle
 region and left upper quadrant of the abdomen due to the position of the
 patient, but there is also a prominent apical lateral visceral pleural line at
 the level of the inferior fourth left posterior rib.  Dr. ___ was
 successfully paged to discuss this finding on ___, at 9:00 a.m., at
 time of discovery.  Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position
 and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is
 accompanied by mild edema.  Persistent bibasilar atelectases, are most
 pronounced in the retrocardiac regions.  Probable small partially layering
 right pleural effusion is similar to recent study.
