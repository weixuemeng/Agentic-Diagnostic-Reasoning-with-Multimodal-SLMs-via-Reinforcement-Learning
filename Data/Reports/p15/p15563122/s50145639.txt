                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cardiac arrest, hypoxia  // eval ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An overlying trauma board and support devices obscure the radiograph. The
 endotracheal tube ends 7 cm above the carina.  A right internal jugular line
 ends in the upper superior vena cava.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged. Mild widening of the mediastinum
 is likely positional. There is no right pleural effusion. The left
 costophrenic angle is not included on the film. Diffused increased opacity in
 the left lung may be due to positioning or a layering pleural effusion. There
 are right-sided rib fractures. There are no focal opacities. No pneumothorax
 identified.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. The endotracheal tube ends 7 cm above the carina and could be advanced.
 
 2.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures are of undetermined chronicity.  No
 definite pneumothorax. Repeat radiograph could be obtained once the patient is
 stable.
 
 3. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette could represent underlying
 cardiomyopathy or a pericardial effusion.
 
 4.  Possible small layering left pleural effusion
