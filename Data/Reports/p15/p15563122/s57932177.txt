  Interval placement of a a left chest tube. Resolution of left apical component
  of pneumothorax.  A small basilar component of the pneumothorax likely still
  remains. Repeat examination in the upright position would be helpful for more
  precise assessment. Support devices in stable position. No other significant
  change.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumothorax, now s/p chest tube placement 
 // resolution of pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement      resolution of
 pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with these earlier study of this day, there has been placement
 of a left chest tube with resolution of the apical pneumothorax.  A smaller
 basilar component of the pneumothorax may still remain.  If possible
 clinically, an upright view would be most helpful. Monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged, as is the appearance of the heart and lungs
 are otherwise.
