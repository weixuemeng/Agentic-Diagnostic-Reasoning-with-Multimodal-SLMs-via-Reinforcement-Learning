   The Arison:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with perforation and retroperitoneal free air s/p routine
 screening colonoscopy, admit for trial of conservative management given
 overall stability  // Eval pneum     Eval pneum
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pneumo retroperitoneum is considerably larger than small pneumomediastinum
 outlining the aortic arch, presumably reflecting air introduced at recent
 colonoscopy, with or without colonic perforation.  There is no free
 subdiaphragmatic gas and no pneumothorax.
 
 
 Lungs are clear.  Heart is normal size.  Vascular coils project over the
 anticipated location of the ligamentum arteriosum, presumably treatment for a
 patent ductus.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
