                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and productive cough.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  Two foci of patchy opacities are seen
 in the right mid lung field on the frontal view.  They are not definitively
 seen on the lateral but potentially localize to the  middle lobe.   Otherwise,
 no other opacities are identified.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable.   An esophageal tube
 is seen with the tip out of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lung, potentially middle lobe pneumonia.  Recommend repeat
 after treatment to document resolution.
