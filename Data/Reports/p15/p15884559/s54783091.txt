 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ? aspiration  // ? aspiration      ?
 aspiration
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again diffuse
 bilateral pulmonary opacifications, worsening on the right. Again this could
 reflect large pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases.
 However, in view of the clinical history, the possibility of superimposed
 aspiration must be seriously considered.
 There has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip about 5 cm above
 the carina. Nasogastric tube extends at least to the mid body of the stomach,
 were crosses the lower margin of the image.
