                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with myeloma and ongoing fatigue of
 unknown origin.  Assess for infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  Heart size is within
 normal limits.  No configurational abnormalities are identified.  Thoracic
 aorta of ordinary ___ but with some calcium deposits in the wall at the
 level of the arch.  No local contour abnormalities are identified.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There is some evidence of increased
 basal translucency at the lung fields suggestive of COPD.  This appears in
 conjunction with some low positioned diaphragms, but there is no evidence of
 any local parenchymal new infiltrate and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.  No pneumothorax is seen in the
 apical area.  When comparison is made with the previous examination, at that
 time appreciated borderline heart size has now normalized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of cardiac enlargement, pulmonary vascular congestion
 or acute infiltrates.  General findings suggestive of some emphysema as
 before.
