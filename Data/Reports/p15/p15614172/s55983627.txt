                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  When compared to prior, lower
 lung volumes are seen with crowding of the bronchopulmonary markings.  The
 lateral view demonstrates increased opacity throughout which is likely
 technical given lack of correlative finding on the frontal view.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but stable in configuration.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are again seen at the aortic arch.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmoanry process.
