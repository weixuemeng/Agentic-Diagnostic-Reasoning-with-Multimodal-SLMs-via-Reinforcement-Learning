                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Lethargy, failure to thrive.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs remain relatively hyperinflated.  Subtle patchy opacity
 projecting over the lateral right mid-to-lower lung, approximately at the
 level of the posterior eighth rib on the frontal view.  Non-specific, but a
 small focus of infection is not excluded, nor is an underlying pulmonary
 nodule.  The left lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle patchy opacity in the lateral right mid-to-lower lung
 could represent a focus of infection, underlying pulmonary lesion not
 excluded.  Recommend followup to resolution,  non-urgent chest CT.
