                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status and lethargy.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from

 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of
 three exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, and the patient is slightly rotated. 
 There is a new retrocardiac opacity which obscures the left hemidiaphragm.  No
 other focal opacities are identified.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified, unchanged
 from prior exams.  The heart size is mildly enlarged, and also unchanged from
 prior exams.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity.  This may represent infection or
 atelectasis.
