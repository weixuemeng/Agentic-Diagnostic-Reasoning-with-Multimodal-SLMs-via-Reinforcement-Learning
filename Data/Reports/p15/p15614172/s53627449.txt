 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:37 PM
  Previously noted retrocardiac opacity appears slightly improved, suggestive of
  improving infection or atelectasis. No new foci of infection identified. If
  clinical suspicion for an atypical infection is high, CT is the more sensitive
  study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old immunosupressed man with chills c/f pneumonia  //
 eval for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ THROUGH ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 PREVIOUS VASCULAR CONGESTION AND BORDERLINE INTERSTITIAL EDEMA HAVE RESOLVED,
 MILD CARDIOMEGALY HAS IMPROVED AND MEDIASTINAL VASCULAR ENGORGEMENT IS NO
 LONGER PRESENT.  THERE COULD BE A NEW ELLIPTICAL OPACITY IN THE LEFT LUNG
 PROJECTING LATERAL TO THE BORDER OR COULD BE CALCIFICATION IN COSTAL.  SHALLOW
 OBLIQUE VIEWS MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO DETERMINE IF THIS IS GENUINE AND A POSSIBLE
 FOCUS OF INFECTION.
