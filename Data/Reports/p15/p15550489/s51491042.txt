                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CP, SOB  // eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right chest port terminates in the upper right atrium, unchanged compared
 with ___.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and diaphragms are flattened, consistent is COPD.
 
 The heart size is within normal limits.  No CHF or focal consolidation. 
 Lateral view suggests a small left pleural effusion or small amount of pleural
 thickening posteriorly.  This is new compared with the ___ CT scan, but
 similar to the ___ left lateral chest x-ray.  A small amount of
 atelectasis is noted at the lung bases.  Prominence of the right paratracheal
 soft tissues is unchanged compared with ___ and with a ___
 chest CT and likely represents vascular structures.
 
 A rounded/curvilinear density overlying the right chest port is more
 conspicuous in comparison to the prior examination, but likely lies outside of
 the lungs.
 Elevation of the distal clavicle consistent with prior trauma is unchanged
 from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflation suggests background COPD.
 
 No acute pulmonary process identified.  No focal consolidation.  Possible
 small left posterior pleural effusion is similar to ___.
 
 A density overlying the patient's chest port likely lies outside of the lungs,
 however oblique views are recommended for further evaluation.
