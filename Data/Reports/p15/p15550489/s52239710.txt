                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of neck cancer with difficulty swallowing. Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT from ___. CTA of the chest from ___. Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right Port-A-Cath is present with the tip at the cavoatrial junction. The
 lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with emphysema. There is bibasilar
 scarring and atelectasis, similar to the prior exams. There is no focal
 airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles suggests new tiny pleural
 effusions. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New tiny bilateral pleural effusions. No evidence of pulmonary edema or
 pneumonia.
