                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Persistent cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ and ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is presence of pectus excavatum
 that contributes to the indistinct appearance of the right heart border,
 unchanged since the prior study.
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is a slightly more pronounced right
 upper lobe opacity, that can retrospectively be seen back in ___.  Is
 better appreciated on the CT chest from ___ where it demonstrated
 to be a cluster of small bronchiectasis and centrilobular and tree-in-___
 nodules.  There is no evidence of new consolidation to suggest superimposed
 infectious process.  The more pronounced appearance of the right upper lobe
 opacity might be consistent with interval progression of inflammation in this
 area.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
