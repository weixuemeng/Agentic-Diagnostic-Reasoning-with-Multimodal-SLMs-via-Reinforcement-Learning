 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of recurrent pneumonias, rule out pneumonia, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of thoracic scoliosis, leading to asymmetry of the rib cage and differences in
 radiolucency of the lung parenchyma.  However, there is no evidence of focal
 parenchymal opacities on the frontal and the lateral radiograph.  No pleural
 effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal hilar and
 mediastinal structures.  No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.
