 FINDINGS:
 
 The left costophrenic angle and left chest wall are incompletely imaged.  An
 enteric catheter courses into the left upper quadrant and crosses the midline
 with tip projecting over the medial right upper quadrant, likely within the
 distal stomach or proximal duodenum.  The left subclavian catheter tip appears
 similarly positioned in the superior vena cava. There is slightly improved
 retrocardiac aeration.

 Enteric catheter terminating in the medial right upper quadrant, likely within
