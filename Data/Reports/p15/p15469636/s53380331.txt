                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man, status post Dobbhoff placement.  Please check
 for placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: Initial images demonstrate a Dobbhoff tube curled in the esophagus
 with its tip terminating at the level of the aortic knob. Subsequent images
 show a Dobhoff tube coursing below the diaphragm with its tip terminating in
 the gastric fundus.  A left subclavian central venous catheter is in unchanged
 position. Lung volumes remain low with accentuation of the cardiac silhouette
 and bronchovascular structures. Left retroardiac opacity persists and may
 reflect volume loss.  There is no definite pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dobhoff tube terminates in the gastric fundus.
