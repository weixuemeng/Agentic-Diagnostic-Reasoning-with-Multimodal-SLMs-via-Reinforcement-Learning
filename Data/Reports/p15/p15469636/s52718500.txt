                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after MCA aneurysm coiling
 and ET tube and OG tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 4 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is in
 the stomach.  There is slight interval improvement in bibasal opacity, but
 unchanged or potentially worsened left lower lobe consolidation with air
 bronchogram concerning for aspiration or potentially pneumonia.  Small amount
 of pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
