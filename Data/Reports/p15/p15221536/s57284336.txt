 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema is stable with mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion. 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis is improved, but there is new obscuration on right
 hemidiaphragm:  It could be due to atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia.  Mild
 cardiac enlargement is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right apical
 calcification is stable since ___.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema with right pleural effusion is stable.
 2.  Right hemidiaphragm is more obscured and this could be due to atelectasis.
 However, aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded.
