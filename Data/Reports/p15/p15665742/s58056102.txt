                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with ? free air seen on CXR from OSH  // Eval for free air,
 infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dilated loops of large bowel are noted in the abdomen.  Intraluminal air is
 likely accounting for the lucency abutting the hemidiaphragms bilaterally.
 However, pneumoperitoneum is difficult to completely exclude on the basis of
 this exam. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs are
 hypoinflated with bibasilar atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or large
 pleural effusion. There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Dilated loops of small and large bowel in the imaged portion of the
 abdomen, likely accounting for increased lucency abutting the hemidiaphragms. 
 If clinical concern persists for pneumoperitoneum, upright abdominal
 radiographs or CT is recommended for further evaluation.
 2.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
