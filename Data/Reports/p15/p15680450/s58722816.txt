                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left lower lobe opacity has nearly resolved with only a small
 residual linear opacity remaining adjacent to the periphery of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Minimal area of linear atelectasis versus scarring is also
 present at the medial aspect of the right lung base with a similar appearance
 on older radiograph of ___.  The heart is normal in size, and the
 aorta is mildly tortuous without change.  No pleural effusion or concerning
 skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near resolution of left lower lobe opacity which may reflect
 response of clinically diagnosed pneumonia to antibiotic therapy.  Small
 residual focus of atelectasis or scar.
