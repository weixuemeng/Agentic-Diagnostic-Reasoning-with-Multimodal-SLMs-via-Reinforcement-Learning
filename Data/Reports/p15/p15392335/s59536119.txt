                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  The patient with right femur fracture with desaturation.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has markedly
 increased.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is no pneumothorax.  If any, there
 are small bilateral pleural effusions.  Interstitial opacities likely reflect
 mild edema, superimposed on emphysema.
