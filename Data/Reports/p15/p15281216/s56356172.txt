 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, both the right and the left
 lung volumes have slightly increased.  The pre-existing opacity at the right
 lung base is less severe than on the previous image.  The size of the cardiac

 retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged as compared to the prior image.  The
 course of the double-lumen left-sided catheter is constant.
