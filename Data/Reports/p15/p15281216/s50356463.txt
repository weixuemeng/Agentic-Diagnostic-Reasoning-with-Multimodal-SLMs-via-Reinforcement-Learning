 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post chest tube placement, evaluation for pneumothorax
 resolution.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 left-sided chest tube.  The chest tube is directed towards the medial portions
 of the mediastinum and currently projects over the aortic knob.  The left lung
 is now well-expanded, no pneumothorax is seen on the left.  Atelectasis of the
 left lower lobe, however, persists.  The pre-existing right upper lobe
 atelectasis is resolved.  The heart continues to be borderline in size.  The
 other monitoring and support devices are constant in appearance.
