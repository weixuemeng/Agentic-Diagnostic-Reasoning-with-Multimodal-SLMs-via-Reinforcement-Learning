                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Loculated pleural effusion, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the loculated pleural
 effusion on the left has not substantially changed.  Both the extent and the
 location are constant in appearance.  Also constant is a relatively large
 retrocardiac atelectasis.  The subtle pre-existing opacities at the right lung
 bases are visually more obvious than on the previous exam.  However, these
 might be caused by overall decreased lung volumes.  A confirmatory radiograph
 should be obtained within the next ___ hours.  Unchanged size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
