                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AAA repair with increasing leukocytosis and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, though the pulmonary vessels are within
 normal limits.  Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
 
 The lateral view shows substantial left effusion.  The possibility of a
 retrocardiac consolidation can certainly not be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
 
 When compared with the AP supine study of ___, the upright examination shows
 substantial rightward displacement of the lower trachea.  Unfortunately, no
 previous upright view of the chest is available for comparison, so that it is
 unclear whether this different appearance has any clinical significance.
