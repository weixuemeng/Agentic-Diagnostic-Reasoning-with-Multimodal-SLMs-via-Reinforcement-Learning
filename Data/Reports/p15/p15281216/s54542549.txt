                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left retrocardiac opacity and effusion with a leukocytosis. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A tunneled large bore right internal jugular central venous
 catheter ends in the mid right atrium, not significantly changed.  The degree
 of dense retrocardiac opacification is not significantly changed.  A layering
 moderate left pleural effusion is not significantly changed.  The right lung
 is clear aside from minimal basilar atelectasis.  Aortic calcifications are
 re-demonstrated.  Moderate cardiomegaly is likely unchanged allowing for
 difference in patient position.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in moderate left pleural effusion and degree of
 left retrocardiac opacification that likely reflects atelectasis.
