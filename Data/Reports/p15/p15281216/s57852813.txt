                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:54 P.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man, AAA repair.  Evaluate right upper lung collapse.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 It is possible that the apparent widening of the right upper mediastinum is
 due to upper lobe collapse, but it is equally likely due to a new fluid
 collection in the mediastinum related to the insertion of a right jugular
 line, either bleeding or extravasation.  Heart size is mildly enlarged and
 unchanged.  There is no appreciable right pleural effusion, and appearance of
 the mediastinum is unchanged since prior to the line insertion, noteworthy for
 the very large and tortuous thoracic aorta.  Very mild interstitial edema is
 still present.
 
 ET tube is in standard position.  Nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach. 
 These findings were discussed yesterday with ___ by telephone at 4
 p.m.  
 
 NOTE: Chest radiograph performed subsequently on ___ 8:05 a.m. showed
 reversion of the right upper mediastinum to a normal appearance.  If the
 current change was due to upper lobe collapse, it resolved.  If this was a
 mediastinal fluid collection, it resorbed and did not re-accumulate.  It also
 could be due in part to vascular engorgement in the supine position.
