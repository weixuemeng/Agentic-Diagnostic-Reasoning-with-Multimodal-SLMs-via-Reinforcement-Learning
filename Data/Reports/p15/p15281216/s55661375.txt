                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:38 A.M. ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia, left lower lobe collapse and acute
 dyspnea.  Is there right-sided involvement?
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Problem in the left lung is a multiloculated left pleural effusion, not
 pneumonia.  The large volume of pleural fluid is responsible for severe
 atelectasis in the left lung as well as rightward mediastinal shift, more
 pronounced today than on ___.  Greater pulmonary vascular congestion
 in the right lung is at least due to redirection of blood flow from the left,
 but there may be volume overload as well.
