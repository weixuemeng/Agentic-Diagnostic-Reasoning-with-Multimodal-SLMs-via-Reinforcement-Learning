                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  None 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again seen is a large opacity of the left lung consistent with a pleural
 effusion and associated rightward mediastinal shift.  There is also some
 increased vascularity in the right lung and small opacity at the right base
 which could represent worsening pulmonary edema, pneumonia or atelectasis.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Large left pleural effusion, which has increased in size from the prior
 study. 
 
 2. Increased vascularity at the right lung and subtle opacity at the right
 base that possibly represents worsening pulmonary edema, infection or
 atelectasis.
