                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post AAA repair with multiple complications.  Now with
 increasing oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to ___, lung volumes are extremely low with
 associated vascular crowding and exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette. 
 Again appreciated is loss of the left hemidiaphragm suggestive of left-sided
 pleural effusion as well as left base volume loss.  There is no evidence of
 interstitial edema.  A right dual-channel dialysis catheter remains in place
 with the tip in the right atrium.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Low lung volumes with persistent left-sided pleural effusion and left lung
 base volume loss.  No evidence of edema or clear consolidation worrisome for
 pneumonia.
