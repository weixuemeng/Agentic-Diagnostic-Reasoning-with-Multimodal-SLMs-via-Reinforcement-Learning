                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  A moderate-sized left pleural effusion with apparent component of
 loculation laterally is similar in size to the previous radiograph, allowances
 are made for differences in technique and positioning.  There remains
 associated left lower lobe collapse.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is
 present, but recently described edema has nearly resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-sized, partially loculated left pleural effusion.  If
 warranted clinically, this could be more fully evaluated by thoracentesis or
 CT imaging.  Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.
