                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post fall.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT chest of ___.  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  Perihilar vascular congestion is noted. 
 Tortuosity of the descending aorta is present.  The heart is mildly enlarged. 
 There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, suggestive of small pleural
 effusion.  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Compression deformities of the upper or mid thoracic vertebral
 bodies are likely unchanged since ___ CT exam.  No displaced fracture is
 seen.  The bones are diffusely demineralized, making evaluation for subtle
 fracture suboptimal.  
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No pneumothorax.  No definite evidence of displaced fracture, however
 bones are osteopenic, which makes detection of subtle fractures suboptimal. 
 In the setting of high clinical suspicion for rib fracture, dedicated rib
 series is more sensitive.
 2.  Small left pleural effusion, perihilar vascular congestion and mild
 cardiomegaly.
