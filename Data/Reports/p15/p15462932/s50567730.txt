                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, fever after known flu weeks ago
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are similar with unchanged prominence of the right superior
 mediastinal contour likely due to tortuous vasculature. Mild upper zone
 vascular redistribution suggests mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Streaky
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Mild degenerative
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and streaky bibasilar atelectasis.
