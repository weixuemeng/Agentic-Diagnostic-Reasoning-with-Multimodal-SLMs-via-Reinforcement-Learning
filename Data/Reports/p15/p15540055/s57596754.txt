 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___; ___; ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a 1 cm nodular opacity in the left mid lung (between the ___ and ___

 left costophrenic angle, consistent with pleural thickening secondary to
 previous parapneumonic effusion in this area.  The Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal in size with left ventricular configuration.  Post-CABG
 changes are stable since the prior exam.  The osseous structures were
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1 cm nodular opacity in the left mid lung.  Recommend dedicated CT scan of the
 chest for confirmation and better characterization of this finding.
 Differential diagnosis includes a small AVM, impacted bronchus, and primary
