                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  CHF.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, and
 significant crackles.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Some of the large amount of the cardiac
 silhouette could be due to pericardial effusion, but there is no indication
 that this is hemodynamically significant since mediastinal veins are normal
 caliber.  Minimal redistribution of pulmonary circulation to the upper lungs
 is stable, but there is no pulmonary edema or more than minimal right pleural
 effusion, if any.  No pneumothorax.
