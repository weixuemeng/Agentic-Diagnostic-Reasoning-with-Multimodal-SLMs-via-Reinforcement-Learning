                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with malignant pleural fluid s/p ___  // r/o
 PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier the same day at 09:22.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An accessed right pectoral MediPort extends into the upper right atrium.  A
 left basilar drainage catheter is unchanged in position. The right pleural
 effusion has substantially decreased post thoracentesis. Bandlike opacities at
 the right lung base are likely due to atelectasis. The small left pleural
 effusion is not appreciably changed.  However, retrocardiac opacification of
 the left lung base has increased.  Mild pulmonary edema has also slightly
 increased. There is no pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantial interval decrease and right pleural effusion post thoracotomy.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 Increased retrocardiac opacification may be due to aspiration or atelectasis.
 
 Right basilar subsegmental atelectasis.
 
 Stable small left pleural effusion with drainage catheter in place.
 
 Slightly increased mild pulmonary edema.
