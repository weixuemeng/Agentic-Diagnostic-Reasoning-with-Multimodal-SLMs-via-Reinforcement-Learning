                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Status post placement of right pleural catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 A new right-sided chest tube has been placed.  A left-sided chest tube appears
 unchanged. A central venous catheter again terminates in the right atrium.
 There is a persistent widespread interstitial abnormality as well as at least
 one substantial nodule projecting over the right mid lung, as well as
 suspected additional ones.  Streaky opacities at the left lung base are not
 specific but may be compatible with coinciding atelectasis. Fissures are
 thickened.  There has been a large decrease in a right pleural effusion, now
 small to moderate in size. A small pleural effusion is difficult to exclude on
 the left. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked decrease in right pleural effusion after chest tube placement;
 otherwise no definite change.
