                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the proximal right atrium,
 unchanged. A moderate to large right pleural effusion has increased
 substantially in the interval. Heart size is difficult to assess given the
 presence of the large right pleural effusion. There is associated right
 basilar atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion is also demonstrated with
 left basilar opacity, also likely atelectasis.  Mediastinal contour is
 unchanged. Diffuse interstitial opacities with a somewhat ill-defined nodular
 component is concerning for worsening lymphangitic spread of tumor with
 metastatic disease. A left basilar chest tube is re- demonstrated.  No
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening diffuse interstitial opacities with a nodular component concerning
 for worsening lymphangitic spread of tumor and metastatic disease. Substantial
 interval increase in size of moderate to large right pleural effusion with
 small left pleural effusion. Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis, though
 tumor is not excluded.
