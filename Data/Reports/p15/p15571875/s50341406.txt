 contours appear stable. Opacification effacing the right cardiophrenic angle
 as well as streaky left basilar opacities are unchanged and consistent with
 minor atelectasis. There is no substantial pleural effusion. A right apical
 pneumothorax has not increased.

 Stable tiny right apical pneumothorax.
