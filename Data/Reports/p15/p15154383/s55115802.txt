                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with nausea, constitutional symptoms including
 chills, fatigue
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contour is unchanged with unfolding of
 the thoracic aorta again noted. Bronchovascular crowding is a result of low
 lung volumes, but no pulmonary edema is present. Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases are most likely reflective of atelectasis. No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality
 is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
