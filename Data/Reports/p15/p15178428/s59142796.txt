                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with COPD, with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is of unknown chronicity.  There is
 additional right basilar opacity which could reflect compressive atelectasis. 
 Patchy left basilar opacity may also reflect additional site of atelectasis. 
 Heart size is difficult to assess but is at least mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Age indeterminate elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis.
