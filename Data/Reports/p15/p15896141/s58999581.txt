                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal, and the mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 Lung volumes are reduced compared to the prior study.  There is minimal
 ill-defined patchy opacities in both lung bases, findings which could reflect
 atelectasis, but infection is difficult to exclude.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy ill-defined opacities in both lung bases, findings which could reflect
 atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
