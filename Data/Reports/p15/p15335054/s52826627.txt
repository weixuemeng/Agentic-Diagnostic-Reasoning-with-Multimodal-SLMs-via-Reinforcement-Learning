                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with crackles at the bases and fever to 100.6. 
 Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Two views of the chest were obtained. Left basal opacities are improved
 suggesting they were due to atelectasis or an aspiration event. Linear right
 basal atelectasis is unchanged. Posterior costophrenic angle is somewhat
 obscured and is likely due to small effusion.  Exaggerated thoracic kyphosis
 is redemonstrated.  Mild cardiomegaly persists with changes from prior
 coronary bypass grafting noted.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: Improved left basal opacities likely from atelectasis or
 aspiration.
