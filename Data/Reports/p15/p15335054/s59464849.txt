 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new fever and slight cough.  Evaluate

 the thoracic aorta.  There are vague densities at lung bases suggestive of
 atelectasis or early infiltrate.  There is no pulmonary edema or pleural
 effusions.  On the lateral view, there is wedging of several thoracic
 vertebral bodies which causes kyphosis of the thoracic spine.  Calcification
 of the anterior longitudinal ligament is seen.  Median sternotomy wires and
