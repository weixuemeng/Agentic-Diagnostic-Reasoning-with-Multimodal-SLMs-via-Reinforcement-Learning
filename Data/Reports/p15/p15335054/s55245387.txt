  Low lung volumes exagerate pulmonary vasculature.  A possible right hilar
  opacity should be re-evalated on repeat radiographs taken with better
  inspiration.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever to 102.6 and with chills.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the previous study from ___.
 
 The heart size is upper limits of normal.  There are low lung volumes due to
 poor inspiratory effort.  There is some crowding of the vascular markings,
 especially around the right hila, and underlying infiltrate in this area is
 not entirely excluded.  This could be better assessed with PA and lateral
 radiograph.  There is coarsening of the bronchovascular markings; however, no
 overt pulmonary edema is seen.  There are no pneumothoraces identified.
