                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, wheezing.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are decreased compared to the prior exam.  The heart size is
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  Increased interstitial markings are
 seen diffusely, most pronounced within the lower lobes.  Mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema, however, may be superimposed.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is clearly noted.  Old right-sided rib fracture is present. 
 Sclerotic density projecting over the right lung apex could reflect a bone
 island within the right 1st rib.  No acute osseous abnormalities are otherwise
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased interstitial markings diffusely, but most pronounced within the lung
 bases.  Findings likely reflect superimposed mild pulmonary edema on a
 background of chronic interstitial lung disease.  An atypical infectious
 process such as a viral infection, however, cannot be completely excluded.
