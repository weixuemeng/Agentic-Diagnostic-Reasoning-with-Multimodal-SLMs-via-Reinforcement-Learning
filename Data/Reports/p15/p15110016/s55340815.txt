 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ESRD and ___ requirement.  // Assess for
 pulm edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged including mild cardiomegaly.  Diffuse opacities in the perihilar
 areas and lower lobes are extensive but slightly improved since the prior
 study and might potentially reflect slightly improving pulmonary edema which
 is still extensive.  Underlying infection is a possibility.
