                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall  // evaluate PICC
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left-sided PICC is seen, distal aspect of the catheter is not well seen,
 may terminate at the brachiocephalic/SVC junction.  Pulmonary edema is again
 seen.  Left base opacity with air bronchograms raises concern for
 consolidation which could be due to underlying pneumonia.  No large pleural
 effusion on the difficult to exclude trace pleural effusions.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
