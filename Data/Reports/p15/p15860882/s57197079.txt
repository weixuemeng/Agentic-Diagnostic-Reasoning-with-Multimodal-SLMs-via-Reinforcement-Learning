  1. Low lung volumes.
  2. Retrocardiac opacification is likely due to atelectasis, however an early
  consolidation is difficult to exclude.
  3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with intoxicated, fall, and possible aspiration, evaluate for
 infiltrates
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding.  Allowing for this, there is
 likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema. 
 Retrocardiac opacification is likely due to atelectasis, however an early
 consolidation is difficult to exclude.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes.
 2. Retrocardiac opacification is likely due to atelectasis, however an early
 consolidation is difficult to exclude.
 3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank edema.
