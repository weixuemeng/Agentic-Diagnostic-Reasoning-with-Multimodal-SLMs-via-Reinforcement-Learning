                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with increasing seizure frequency.  Is there
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Two frontal and two lateral views were performed.  Both frontal views suggest
 left lower lobe pneumonia, corroborated on just one of the lateral views,
 taken at lower lung volumes.  I think the finding should be considered in
 either recent aspiration or pneumonia, unless excluded clinically.  Findings
 were discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at 11:10 a.m.
 
 Right lung is clear.  There is no pleural abnormality, hilar and
 cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  A pacer device in the left
 anterior chest wall sends a filamentous lead to the left lower neck.
