                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea and history of pulmonary embolism.

 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA from ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A previously noted right lower lobe opacity is not seen and
 better assessed on the recent chest CT.  There is no pulmonary edema.  The
 heart is normal in size, and the mediastinal contours are normal.  Air noted
 in the esophagus may reflect esophagitis.

 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Air in the esophagus may reflect esophagitis.
