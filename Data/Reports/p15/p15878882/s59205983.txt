                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  Previous exam from outside institution performed earlier the same
 day.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Lateral view is limited secondary to
 patient's arms being down by her side.  The lungs appear clear of
 consolidation, large effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  The aorta however is tortuous with dense
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted particularly at the arch.  Surgical clips
 project over the right axilla and right upper quadrant.  No displaced fracture
 is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
