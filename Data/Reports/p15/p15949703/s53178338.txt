                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is possibly a trace pleural effusion on the left, none on the right.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Streaky opacities in the left lower lobe suggest minor
 atelectasis.  Spinal curvature appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky left posterior lobe opacities, probably atelectasis.
