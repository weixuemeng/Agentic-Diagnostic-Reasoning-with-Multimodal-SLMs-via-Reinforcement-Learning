                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Schizophrenia, currently reports of not feeling well,
 cloudy with increased somnolence and twitching, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Low lung volumes
 somewhat limit evaluation.  Likely mild atelectasis or bronchovascular
 crowding accounts for subtle opacities in the lower lungs.  There is no
 definite sign of pneumonia, CHF, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures are intact. 
 There is no free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  Subtle opacities in the lower
 lungs likely atelectasis or bronchovascular crowding.  If needed, a repeat
 study with more optimized inspiratory effort may be performed to confirm.
