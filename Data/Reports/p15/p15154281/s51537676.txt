                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette. Low lung volumes somewhat limit evaluation, resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Marked
 degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
