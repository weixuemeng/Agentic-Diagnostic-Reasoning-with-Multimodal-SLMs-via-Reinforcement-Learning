                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pain and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes appear within normal limits.  There no
 focal pulmonary opacities, pleural effusions, or evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Osseous structures appear unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Note that chest radiographs
 have limited utility in assessing for pulmonary embolism.
