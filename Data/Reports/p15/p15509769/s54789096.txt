                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting with shortness of breath, hx of
 asthma, CHF, and recent PNA.  Evaluate for pneumonia versus congestive heart
 failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiograph views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is minimal.  Right lower
 lobe opacity could reflect the patient's history of recent pneumonia.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion
 without overt edema.  There is prominent pericardial fat.  No overt edema,
 pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.  No acute osseous abnormality.  Aortic knob
 calcifications are mild.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lower lobe opacity could reflect resolving pneumonia given patient's
 history of recent pulmonary infection.  Correlation with outside imaging
 studies or reports would be helpful in this regard.
 
 Cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest radiograph in 4 to 6 weeks to ensure resolution.
