                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Enlarging xiphoid process.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the xiphoid process is
 extremely difficult to evaluate on the current study.  CT would be necessary
 for further evaluation if clinically warranted.  There is some prominence of
 the central pulmonary vessels with rapid tapering, raising the possibility of
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.  No acute focal pneumonia or vascular
 congestion.
