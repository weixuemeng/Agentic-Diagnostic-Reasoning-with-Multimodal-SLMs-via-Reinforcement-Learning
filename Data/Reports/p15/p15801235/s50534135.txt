                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. Left
 internal jugular central venous catheter tip appears to terminate at the
 confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. The patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  The 2 upper most sternotomy wires are fractured, and the
 2 most inferior sternotomy wires are deviated to the left of midline compared
 to the remainder of the sternotomy wires.  Lung volumes are low.  The heart
 size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinum superiorly appears somewhat widened,
 but this may be due to low lung volumes and supine technique.  There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures with probable mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax
 seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position.  Left internal jugular
 central venous catheter tip terminates at the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic veins.  
 
 2. Low lung volumes with streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflecting atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  
 
 3. Fracture of the two most superior sternotomy wires, with leftward
 displacement of the two most inferior sternotomy wires relative to the
 remaining sternotomy wires.  This could suggest sternal dehiscence in the
 correct clinical setting, and clinical correlation is recommended.
