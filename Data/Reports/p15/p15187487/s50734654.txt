                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest (PA and lateral)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with cough and wheezing ; evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left-pectoral cardiac device with one
 lead terminating in the right ventricle.  Lung volumes are low and there is a
 small amount of right middle lobe atelectasis.   Otherwise, no significant
 interval change.   Stable prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 which may be secondary to slight apical lordotic technique and low lung
 volumes.  Stable appearance of the hila and pleura.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, pulmonary vascular congestion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.
