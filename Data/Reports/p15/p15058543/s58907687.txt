                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low, and this accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is likely top normal.  Apparent mediastinal widening is also likely due
 to low lung volumes.  The aortic knob is calcified.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is present.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are
 multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  Diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
