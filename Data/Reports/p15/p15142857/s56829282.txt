                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain, rule out CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single, AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 costophrenic angles are not completely included on the image.  Given this,
 relative lucency of the upper lobes as compared to the lung bases may be due
 to pulmonary emphysema.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  No pulmonary edema is seen.  No displaced
 fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic findings to suggest CHF.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
