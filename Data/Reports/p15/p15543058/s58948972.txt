                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with new desaturations, fever and diaphoresis.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior chest x-ray for
 comparison; however, correlation is made to images from CT scan of the abdomen
 and pelvis from ___. Low lung volumes are seen.  Although there
 is opacity in one of the lower lobes on the lateral view, this area was clear
 on prior chest CT and is most compatible with atelectasis.  Blunting of the
 posterior costophrenic angles are also compatible with atelectasis. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits as are the osseous and
 soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essentially unremarkable chest x-ray given low lung volumes.
