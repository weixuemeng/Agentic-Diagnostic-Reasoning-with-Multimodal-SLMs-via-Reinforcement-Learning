                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of recent pneumonia.  Please evaluate for persistent
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, most
 recently from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal. Although there has been interval resolution of the of the previously
 noted right basilar opacity, there is a new triangular opacity silhouetting
 the right heart border, likely secondary to atelectasis, however an infectious
 process cannot be excluded. Bilateral costophrenic angle blunting is again
 seen, which may be secondary to small bilateral pleural effusions or
 hyperinflated lungs.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Note is made of
 cervical fusion hardware. Surgical clips are seen in the abdomen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Although there has been interval resolution of the previously noted right
 basilar opacity, there is a new triangular opacity silhouetting the right
 heart border which is likely secondary to right middle lobe atelectasis,
 however an acute infectious process cannot be excluded.
