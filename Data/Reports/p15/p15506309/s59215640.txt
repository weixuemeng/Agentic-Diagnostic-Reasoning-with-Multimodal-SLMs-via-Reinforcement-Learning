 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  More would obesity status post assault with pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral Lateral image degraded by overlying motion
 artifact.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Examination is limited by body habitus.  Heart size is mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Diffuse increased
 opacity of the lung fields may represent some component of edema, although
 this is difficult to evaluate given body habitus.  Lungs are otherwise grossly
 clear.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible component of fluid overload which is difficult to assess given large
 body habitus.
