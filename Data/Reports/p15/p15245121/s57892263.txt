                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard
 position.  Widening of cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for
 positional differences between the exams.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is
 present as well as worsening patchy bibasilar opacities which may reflect
 patchy atelectasis or aspiration.  Apparent small left pleural effusion has
 increased in size.
