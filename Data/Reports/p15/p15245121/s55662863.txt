 No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 Allowing for patient's rotation and low lung volumes, heart is upper limits of
 normal in size, and mediastinal contours are grossly within normal limits.  No
 focal areas of consolidation are present within the lungs, and there are no
 definite pleural effusions, although left costophrenic angle is not optimally
 visualized.
