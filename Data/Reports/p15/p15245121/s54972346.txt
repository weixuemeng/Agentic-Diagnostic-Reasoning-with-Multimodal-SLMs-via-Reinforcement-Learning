 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Central line placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in
 the upper superior vena cava.  There is no evidence for pneumothorax.  The
 left lung base is better aerated with decrease in the extent of elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm and basilar opacification of the left lung.  A right
 basilar opacity is unchanged.  Early pneumonia could be considered.  There is
 also some suggestion of upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vascularity. 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Improved aeration at the left lung base.  Persistent right basilar
 opacity; pneumonia could be considered.  Suspected mild vascular congestion.
