                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued opacification
 at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with a small
 pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe.  An area of question
 opacification at the right base most likely was artifactual and is no longer
 seen.  No evidence of vascular congestion.
 
 Right subclavian catheter remains in good position.
