  ET tube 6 cm above carina.  Low lung volumes.  Questionable developing right
  middle lobe opacity although this is most likely atelectasis to the low lung
  volume

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New intubation, evaluation of tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4 to 5 cm above the
 carina.  The tube could be minimally advanced.  The other monitoring and
 support devices including the right internal jugular vein catheter and the
 nasogastric tube are in correct position.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  In the interval, the lung volumes have minimally decreased,
 with new areas of atelectasis appeared at the right lung base.  No other
 relevant changes.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pulmonary
 edema.
