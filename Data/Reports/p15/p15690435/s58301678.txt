 HISTORY:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube is seen approximately
 7.5 cm from the carina at the level of the clavicular heads and could be
 advanced several cm for optimal positioning.  There are bilateral parenchymal
 opacities potentially due to edema versus ARDS or multifocal pneumonia.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.  Impression
