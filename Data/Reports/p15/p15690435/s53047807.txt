                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Patchy
 opacity persists in the right infrahilar and retrocardiac area, and could
 potentially be due to a developing infection given clinical suspicion for this
 entity.  Lungs are otherwise clear, and there are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothoraces.
