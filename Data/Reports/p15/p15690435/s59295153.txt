 HISTORY:  Upper GI bleeding and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Two frontal chest radiographs were obtained.  A right internal jugular
 catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  Enteric catheter ends in the upper
 portion of a normal caliber stomach.  The lungs are well expanded and
 essentially ___.  There is no pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Heart size
 is normal.  Fullness in the right tracheobronchial angle, leftward expansion
 of the mediastinum at the thoracic inlet and enlargement of the left hilus
 could be due to adenopathy. Heart is normal size.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible mediastinal and left hilar adenopathy. PA and lateral radiographs
 should be obtained and clinical history examined to see if Chest CT scanning
 is needed for clarification.
 
 I discussed these findings with Dr ___ by telephone at the time of
 dictation.
