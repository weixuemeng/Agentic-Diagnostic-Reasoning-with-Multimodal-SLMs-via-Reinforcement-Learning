                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with COPD status post endobronchial valves placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  3 endobronchial valves are re- demonstrated in unchanged position.
 Marked upper lobe predominant centrilobular emphysema is re- demonstrated. 
 Linear opacities in lung bases likely reflect a combination of scarring and
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 detected.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Multiple clips project over the left
 upper quadrant of the abdomen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged location of 3 endobronchial valves.  Severe emphysema with bibasilar
