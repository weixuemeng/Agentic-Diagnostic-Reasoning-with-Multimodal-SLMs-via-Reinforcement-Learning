                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Compared to prior, there
 is no change.  Subtle opacity in the left suprahilar region is unchanged and
 as previously characterized.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Rounded opacity
 over the right lung base laterally on one of the frontal views is most
 compatible with a nipple shadow.  Streaky right basilar opacity is most likely
 atelectasis given low lung volumes.  Trace bilateral effusions are identified.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic
 calcification is seen at the aortic arch.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Trace bilateral effusions.  Relatively linear right lower lung
 opacity on the frontal view is suggestive of atelectasis, especially given low
 lung volumes.
