                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea and questionable CHF, evaluate for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP supine view of the chest was obtained. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Diffuse bilateral opacities are most
 compatible with mild to moderate pulmonary edema. Increased opacity in the
 lateral aspect of the right base may be related to asymmetric edema; however,
 it could also be concealing pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 2.  Right lower lobe opacity could represent asymmetric edema, but may also
 conceal pneumonia. Attention on follow up is recommended.
