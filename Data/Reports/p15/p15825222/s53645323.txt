 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and fevers after returning from ___,
 question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is airspace consolidation seen within the left lower lobe and
 inferior segment of the lingula.  There is subtle opacity at the right lung
 base as well, which could also reflect developing pneumonia.  The heart size
 is grossly normal, though the left heart border is partially silhouetted. 
 There is likely a small left and possibly a tiny right pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe and inferior segment lingular pneumonia. 
 Possible early pneumonia in the right lower lung and possible tiny bilateral
 pleural effusions.
