  Multiple focal parencymal opacities, mostly in the right lung, which are
  generally stable since the prior exam.  The intersitial opacities are
  improving, suggestive of an improving instersitial pneumonia.  The residual
  opacities may either be residual pneumonia or metastatic disease. There is no
  new opacity.  There are small bilateral pleural effuions, including a loculate
  portion tracking along the right costophrenic angle.  Stable cardiomediastinal
  silhouette.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic pancreatic cancer, evaluation for
 pneumonia.  Concern for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Focal parenchymal opacities of multiple origin, most are located in
 the right lung, with judge annually, stable as compared to the previous
 examination.  The pre-existing interstitial opacities are improving,
 suggesting improving interstitial pneumonia or mild interstitial fluid
 overload.  The residual opacities might eight be healing pneumonia or
 metastatic disease.  No opacities have newly occurred.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions, stable mild cardiomegaly.
