                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Heterogeneous right lung base opacity
 has increased since ___ and is consistent with infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Subtle opacity overlying the right mid and
 upper lobes could represent additional foci of pneumonia or atelectasis in
 setting of low lung volumes.  The left lung is essentially clear.  No
 pneumothorax.  The heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Heterogeneous right lung base opacity consistent with infection is better
 assessed on concurrently performed CT abdomen/pelvis.
 2.  Subtle right mid and upper lobe opacities could represent additional foci
 of pneumonia or atelectasis.
