                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis, recently had pneumonia 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a large region of consolidation involving the left lung, involving
 the upper lobes, lingula, and possibly the left lower lobe, significantly
 increased since the prior study.  Patchy right basilar opacity may represent
 atelectasis or additional site of consolidation.  Additional subtle opacity
 projecting over the right upper lobe, in the region of the posterior right ___
 rib, may be additional site of consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are relatively low lung volumes.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large left lung consolidation involving the left upper lobe, lingula, and
 possibly left lower lobe.  Possible right lower lobe consolidation versus
 atelectasis.  Additional subtle opacity projecting over the right upper lobe,
 in the region of the posterior right 4th rib, may be additional site of
 consolidation.  Overall findings are most consistent with multifocal
 pneumonia.
