                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a history of hemoptysis, P-ANCA positive.  I
 was told she had pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Heterogeneous opacification present in both the right lower lobe, best
 appreciated on the lateral view projecting over the spine and partially
 obscuring the adjacent right diaphragmatic pleural surface, and in the right
 upper lobe, mostly anterior segment.  Of course it would be helpful to have
 this compared to previous radiographic appearance, but I have no previous
 chest imaging available currently.  The morphology of the right lung findings
 is not characteristic of Wegner or other large or intermediate vasculitis.  It
 suggests instead infection, capillaritis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, or drug
 reaction, including toxic, allergic, and vasogenic.  The pulmonary vasculature
 including the hila is normal.  Heart is not enlarged though the right atrium
 is more prominent than expected, but this is unlikely to be important since
 neither the pulmonary outflow tract nor mediastinal veins are dilated.  There
 is no pleural effusion and the indentation of the spleen on the stomach does
 not suggest splenomegaly.
