                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of liver cirrhosis with chest pain
 and cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared with prior exam, there is no significant interval change
 in opacification of the right lower lung, likely a combination of large
 pleural effusion, with some fluid tracking into the minor fissure, and
 consolidation/atelectasis of the RLL.  The left lung is clear.  Heart size
 cannot be assessed due to obscuration of the right heart border.  There is no
 left-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change in opacification of the right lung
 base secondary to large right sided pleural effusion with underlying
 consolidation/atelectasis of the right lower lobe.
