                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with HCC and failure to thrive, status post PICC
 placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a right PICC with tip
 at the caval-brachiocephalic junction.  An enteric tube traverses below the
 diaphragm into the stomach and out of view.  There is now complete
 opacification of the right hemithorax with left shift of the trachea and
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, consistent with a large pleural effusion.  The
 left lung is decreased in volume but relatively well aerated.  There is no
 large effusion on the left.  Limited view of the right humerus raises question
 of osseous demineralization.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right PICC with tip at the caval-brachiocephalic junction.
 2.  Marked increase of right pleural effusion, now opacifying the entire right
 hemithorax.
