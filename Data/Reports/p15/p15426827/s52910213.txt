                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:42 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old patient with Dobbhoff feeding tube, not flushing despite
 re-positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP view of the chest compared to ___ at 5:49 p.m.:
 
 The Dobbhoff tube has been withdrawn to the neck, projecting over both the
 esophagus and the trachea so that a single frontal view cannot localize it to
 either.  It needs to be fully withdrawn and re-inserted.  Radiology resident
 reported the findings by telephone to Dr. ___ at 8:05 p.m.
 
 Large right pleural effusion is unchanged since earlier in the day, having
 grown substantially since ___.  Moderate atelectasis persists at the base
 of the left lung.  Obscuration of the cardiac silhouette makes it impossible
 to assess its size.  No pneumothorax.
