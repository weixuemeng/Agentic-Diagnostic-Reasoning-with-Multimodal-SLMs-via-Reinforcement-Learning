 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post thoracocentesis, now desaturation.  Evaluation for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 2:03 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimally
 increasing parenchymal opacity in the middle lobe, likely caused by
 reexpansion pulmonary edema.  However, no pneumothorax is seen.  The pleural
 drain was removed.  Normal appearance of the left lung.
