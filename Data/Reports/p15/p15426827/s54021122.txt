                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  History of cirrhosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates low lung volumes with
 severe right lower lobe atelectasis and obscuration of the heart borders. 
 Some fluid is again seen tracking along the minor fissure, similar to slightly
 worse from ___. The left lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Additionally noted are tiny lytic lesions throughout both proximal humeri, not
 present on prior radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Stable to slightly worsened right pleural effusion with evidence of volume
 loss.
 
 2.  Lytic lesions are newly apparent in each proximal humerus and appear
 aggressive; differential considerations an aggressive metabolic demineralizing
 but other possibilities include multiple myeloma, although probably less
 likely.  A bone survey and correlation with calcium panel and serum
 electrophoresis may be appropriate to investigate further if needed
 clinically.
