                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:49 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis.  Needs Dobbhoff for feeding tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  A series of chest radiographs, comprising at least five serial
 exposures after attempts at placement of a feeding tube, all with wire stylet
 in place.  What is purportedly the last in the series shows the weighted tip
 of the feeding tube folded up against the cardia but perhaps with the tip in
 the gastroesophageal junction.  Subsequent chest radiograph two hours later
 showed that the feeding tube had withdrawn to the upper esophagus or had been
 reinserted in either the upper esophagus or the trachea.  House staff had been
 notified.  All the examinations show persistence of a large right pleural
 effusion, severe cardiomegaly, and marked left lower lobe atelectasis, but no
 pneumothorax.
