                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis and encephalopathy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A single frontal view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low lung
 volumes results in bronchovascular crowding.  Increased opacity at the right
 lung base since ___ likely represents a pleural effusion and
 atelectasis but supervening infection cannot be excluded.  The right upper
 lung zone and the left lung are clear.  The cardiac silhouette is unchanged. 
 Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right lower lung opacity likely represents pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, but supervening infection cannot be excluded.
