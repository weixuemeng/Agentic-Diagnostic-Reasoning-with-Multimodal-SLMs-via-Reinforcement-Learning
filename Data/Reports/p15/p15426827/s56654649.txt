                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from 9 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Large right pleural
 effusion is unchanged.  Linear density along the right apex with medial
 lucency is equivocal for possible pneumothorax; particularly as no prior
 studies have demonstrated the presence of an azygos fissure.  The left lung is
 largely clear.  The portions of the cardiomediastinal contour the can be
 assessed appear unremarkable; although the right mediastinal border is poorly
 evaluated due to presence of large effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded and if indicated, this can be
 assessed by CT chest or followed with radiographs.  
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at ___ on ___ by phone.
