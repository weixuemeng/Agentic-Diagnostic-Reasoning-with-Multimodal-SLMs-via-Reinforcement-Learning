                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cirrhosis and recurrent pleural
 effusion, evaluate for interval development in effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient's condition required examination in sitting upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the
 next preceding AP single view examination of ___.  When
 comparing the frontal views, the right-sided basal haze has increased
 indicating that pleural effusion on the right side has increased, now
 obliterates the entire diaphragmatic contour.  On the left side, the lateral
 pleural sinus remains free.  The lateral view confirms the bilateral high
 position of the diaphragms and discloses a relatively small amount of pleural
 effusion that blunts right posterior pleural sinus.  New pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrates cannot be identified.  The position of the previously identified
 right-sided PICC line is confirmed on the lateral view and seen to terminate
 in the lower third of the SVC.  A previously present Dobbhoff line is not seen
 anymore.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing amount of right-sided pleural effusion. 
 Quantification is impossible as the previous examination did not allow
 assessment of lateral view findings.
