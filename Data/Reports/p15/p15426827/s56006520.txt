                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 2:46 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis.  Evaluate Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lateral aspect of the right chest and upper abdomen are excluded from the
 study.  Greater opacification in the right lower hemithorax suggests posterior
 layering of a moderate right pleural effusion.  Feeding tube with the wire
 stylet fully inserted is coiled in the upper portion of a non-distended
 stomach.  Dilated bowel loops in the upper abdomen are clustered in the
 midline, suggesting ascites.  Left lung is clear.
