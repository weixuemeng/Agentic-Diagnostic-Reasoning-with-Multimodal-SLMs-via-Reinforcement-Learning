                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed.
 
 No prior chest radiograph available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Both lungs are well expanded and clear.  There are no lung opacities of
 concern.  The lower part of the sternum on the lateral view is off the
 radiograph's view and hence its assessment was limited.  There are no rib
 fractures.  No pleural effusion.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
