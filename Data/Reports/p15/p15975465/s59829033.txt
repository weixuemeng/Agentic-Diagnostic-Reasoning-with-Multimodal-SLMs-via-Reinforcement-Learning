 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with effusion  // f/u effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a moderate increase of the
 known left pleural effusion. The large parenchymal opacity in the perihilar
 areas, potentially reflecting a hilar or perihilar mass, is unchanged.  There
 is no evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax.  Mild atelectasis at the
 right lung bases persists. No other right lung changes.
