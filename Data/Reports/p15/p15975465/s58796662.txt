                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with Stage IV NSCLC now with leukocytosis  //
 r/o PNA      r/o PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the apical pleural cap on the
 left has substantially decreased, as has fluid in the costophrenic angle. 
 Postsurgical changes are again seen on the left.
 On the right, there is now extensive opacification in the hilar region with
 irregular, spiculated margins that is worrisome for malignancy.  Increased
 opacification at the base is consistent with pleural fluid, which could be
 malignant, as well as some volume loss in the lower lung.
 The possibility of superimposed pneumonia would be impossible to exclude on
 this study.
