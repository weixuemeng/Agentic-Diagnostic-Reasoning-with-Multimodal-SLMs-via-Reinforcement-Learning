                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated.  There is subtle opacity projecting in the right upper lobe
 abutting the minor fissure, which could represent an early pneumonia.  Linear
 retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis or scarring.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures appear
 intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacity in the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure
 concerning for pneumonia.
