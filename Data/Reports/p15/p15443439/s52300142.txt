                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with effusion, edema  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 19:36
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Compared with the prior study, the appearance is grossly unchanged.  Again
 seen is tracheostomy tube and right subclavian and left IJ central lines,
 similar in appearance.  No pneumothorax is detected, allowing for obscuration
 of the lung apex by the overlying mass.
 
 Again seen are diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities throughout both
 lungs, with increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of both
 hemidiaphragms.  Probable right and suspected left pleural effusions.  The
 appearance is compatible with pulmonary edema and bi basilar effusions, but
 the possibility of an associated pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt significant change compared with ___ at 19:36
