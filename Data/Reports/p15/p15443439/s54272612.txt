 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p trach after prolonged intubation, now with
 desats  // eval for interval change      eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The severe, global, consolidative pulmonary abnormality may have improved
 slightly, but some of that apparent improvement is really attributable to a
 decrease in substantial bilateral pleural effusion.  Left lower lobe remains
 densely consolidated, but the accompanying leftward mediastinal shift to
 suggest this is substantially atelectasis.  Heart size is indeterminate,
 probably moderately enlarged and recently unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Tracheostomy tube midline.  Left PIC line ends at the origin of the SVC.  Left
 jugular catheter ends in the mid SVC.
