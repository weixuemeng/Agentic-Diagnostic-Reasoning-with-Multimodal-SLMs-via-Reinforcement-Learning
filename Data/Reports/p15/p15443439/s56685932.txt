 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis is still severe but somewhat improved.  There has
 also been a little clearing in the left upper lobe component of bilateral
 consolidative abnormality.  Since this is accompanied by continued decrease in
 bilateral pleural effusions I suspect the process is substantially pulmonary
 edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly is still present.  No pneumothorax.  Lines and
 tubes are unchanged from before.  .
