 Endotracheal tube has its tip 3 cm above the carina.  The left subclavian PICC
 line terminates in the proximal to mid SVC.  Left internal jugular central
 line has its tip in the proximal SVC near the junction with the
 brachiocephalic vein.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm
 with the tip not identified.  There is increasing bibasilar consolidation and
 layering effusions, right greater than left.  Findings are suggestive of
 atelectasis.  A superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded.  No
 pulmonary edema.  No obvious pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are likely unchanged.
