                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with post op with ETT  // STAT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since ___, there has been interval placement of an ET tube, which
 terminates 4.7 cm above the carina, and an enteric tube, which coils at the GE
 junction and ascends within the esophagus to the level of the clavicles.  The
 previously identified large hiatal hernia is not identified on this
 examination due to a combination of moderate left pleural effusion and
 associated compressive atelectasis.  Heart and mediastinum appear mildly
 enlarged and there is mild pulmonary edema, which may be exaggerated by
 overall low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 An ET tube terminates 4.7 cm above the carina.
 An enteric tube is coiled within the esophagus.
 Moderate left pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis.
 New mild pulmonary edema
