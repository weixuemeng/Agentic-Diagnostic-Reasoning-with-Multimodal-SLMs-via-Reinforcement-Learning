                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F status post NGT placement, confirm NGT placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-erect AP view radiograph chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The new enteric tube extends below the diaphragm and outside of the field of
 within the stomach.  A right subclavian central venous catheter and a
 tracheostomy tube are unchanged.  Compared to the immediate prior study
 bilateral pleural effusions have decreased, now moderate.  Extensive confluent
 parenchymal opacities bilaterally decreased as well, likely reflecting
 improved pulmonary edema.  The osseous structures and upper abdomen are
 unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New enteric tube terminates outside of the field of view within the
 stomach.
 2. Interval decrease in bilateral pleural effusions, now moderate.
 3. Interval improvement in persistent extensive parenchymal opacities.
