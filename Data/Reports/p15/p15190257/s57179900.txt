 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Patchy opacities are noted in the lung

 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are seen within the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis and scarring, without
 focal consolidation.  No pulmonary edema.
