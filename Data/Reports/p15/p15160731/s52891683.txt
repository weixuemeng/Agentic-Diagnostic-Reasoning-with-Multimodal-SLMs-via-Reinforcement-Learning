                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  A hazy left basilar opacity
 blurs the left heart border on the frontal projection.  There is no clear
 correlate on the lateral view, but potentially in the retrocardiac clear
 space.  Tiny the left costophrenic angle is blunted by a small pleural
 effusion.  Heart size is normal.  Aortic arch calcifications and tortuosity
 are mild.  There is no pneumothorax or displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar opacity cannot be completely attributed to soft tissue
 attenuation and could represent aspiration or early pneumonia in the correct
 clinical context.  Repeat after treatment suggested to document resolution.
