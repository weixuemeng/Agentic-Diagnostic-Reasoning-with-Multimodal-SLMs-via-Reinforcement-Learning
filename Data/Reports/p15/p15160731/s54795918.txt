                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after dual chamber
 pacemaker insertion.
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of right atrium and
 right ventricle.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The course of the
 leads is unremarkable as well as the position of the left-sided pacemaker.
 
 Large hiatal hernia is redemonstrated on both PA and lateral views.  Lungs are
 essentially clear with no evidence of appreciable pleural effusion.  Minimal
 opacity along the left cardiac border is unchanged since the prior study, most
 likely reflecting chronic changes.
 
 As previously commented on the prior radiograph, there is evidence of
 compression fracture most likely of lower thoracic-upper lumbar spine,
 unchanged.
