                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  The
 lungs are well expanded without dense consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Subtle opacity at the right lung base is likely crowding of
 vessels but may represent infection in the appropriate clinical setting. Heart
 size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is identified. A left pectoral intracardiac device
 tip projects over the right ventricle. An LAD stent is in place. A 10mm nodule
 over the right lung basemay be nipple.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Mild opacity at the right lung base is likely crowding of vessels but could
 represent early infection in the appropriate clinical setting.  A lateral view
 could be performed for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.
 2. Nodule at the right lung base, potentially a nipple. Further evaluation
 suggested with nipple markers in place.
