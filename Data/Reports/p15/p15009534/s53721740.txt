                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with  altered mental status// acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates
 diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications. Small hiatal hernia is re-
 demonstrated.  The hilar contours are normal, and the pulmonary vascularity is
 not engorged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted, decreased in size
 on the right compared to the previous exam. Streaky opacities in the lung
 bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is present. Diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures is noted with severe compression
 deformities of at least ___ mid thoracic vertebral bodies, unchanged, resulting
 in marked kyphosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis with trace bilateral pleural effusions.
