                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness  // ? pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As before, there is basilar atelectasis but no consolidation worrisome for
 pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions persist. Cardiomegaly persists. 
 As before, there is aortic arch calcification and descending aortic
 calcification indicating atherosclerosis. As before, there are multiple
 compression fractures in the mid thoracic spine with kyphosis.  There is a
 central compression fracture in the lower thoracic spine, as before.  No
 definite new fractures, though the bones are osteopenic, limiting sensitivity
 for detection of subtle fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite pneumonia with persistent atelectasis and small pleural effusions.
 Multiple compression fractures of the thoracic spine, as before.
