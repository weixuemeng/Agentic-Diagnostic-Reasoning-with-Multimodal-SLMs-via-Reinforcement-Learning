                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent blunting of the costophrenic angles which may be due to
 trace pleural effusions and/ or pleural thickening.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 Mild prominence of the interstitial markings bilaterally again seen,
 suggesting chronic lung disease.  No definite focal consolidation.  The bones
 are diffusely osteopenic.  There is a compression deformity of the the upper
 to mid thoracic vertebral body, also seen on the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles suggests trace pleural effusion
 and/ or pleural thickening.
