                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The severe cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is
 unchanged.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  A focus of retrocardiac opacity
 seen only on the lateral view could represent either atelectasis or infection.
 The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
