                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain likely angina, previous admission for demand
 NSTEMI, evaluate for any cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the immediate prior study there has been a slight interval
 increase in mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is likely mild
 associated interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion, focal
 consolidation, or pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly, numerous mediastinal
 clips, median sternotomy wires, and atherosclerotic calcification of the
 aortic arch are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval increase in mild pulmonary vascular congestion, likely
 associated with trace interstitial pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation.
