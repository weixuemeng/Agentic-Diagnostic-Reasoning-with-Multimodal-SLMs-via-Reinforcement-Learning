 INDICATION:  ___ year old male with altered mental status.  Please evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP frontal chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low causing crowding of the central bronchovascular
 structures.  The heart size is normal given AP technique.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  MILD WIDENING OF THE
 MEDIASTINUM TO THE RIGHT OF MIDLINE IS PROBABLY DUE TO FAT DEPOSITION.
