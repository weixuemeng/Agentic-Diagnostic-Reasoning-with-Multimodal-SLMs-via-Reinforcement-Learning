 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypotension, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral perihilar
 opacities have decreased in extent and severity.  However, there is unchanged
 blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially suggesting a small
 pleural effusion.  Normal appearance of the cardiac silhouette, but more
 central pulmonary arteries are still slightly dilated.  Unchanged monitoring
 and support devices.
