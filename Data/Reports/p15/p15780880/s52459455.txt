                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Sepsis, colitis, persistent rhonchi.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing
 parenchymal opacities have slightly decreased in extent and severity but are
 still clearly visible, notably in the region of the right apex.  The bilateral
 pleural effusions, better visualized on the lateral than on the frontal
 radiograph, persist.  Unchanged normal hilar structures and normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette, with minimal calcification of the aortic wall and minimal
 tortuosity of the aorta.  No pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative right shoulder
 disease.
