                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD exacerbation. Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate hyperinflated lungs,
 consistent with COPD.  The cardiac size is within normal limits. The contour
 of the ascending aorta is prominent, either related to an aneurysm or
 tortuosity.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is
 seen.  A calcified granuloma in the left upper lobe is clinically
 insignificant. There is no evidence of reactivation infection.
 
 Right posterior middle rib fractures are well-healed
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation to suggest an infectious process.
