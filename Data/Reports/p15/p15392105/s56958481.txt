                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with shortness of breath, copd  // eval for
 pulmonary process, persistent dyspnea
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, the lungs remain hyperinflated with
 extensive lower lung predominant bullae. Right upper lobe bronchiectasis is
 again demonstrated, but the extent of bronchial wall thickening and
 peribronchiolar opacification are slightly improved. nonspecific left apical
 scarring appears similar. Heart size is normal. Tortuous thoracic aorta is
 likely unchanged considering patient rotation. High-grade compression
 deformity in the mid thoracic spine is similar to the prior radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Lower low lung predominant bullous emphysema is highly suggestive of alpha
 1 antitrypsin deficiency.
 
 2. Right upper lobe bronchiectasis with associated improving peribronchiolar
 opacities which may reflect resolving airways infection or aspiration. Alpha 1
 antitrypsin deficiency may also be associated with bronchiectasis. If
 warranted clinically, chest CT could be obtained for more complete assessment
 of the airways. At that time, the thoracic aorta may also be more fully
 assessed to help differentiate tortuosity from dilation of the structure.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 11:48 into the Department of Radiology
 critical communications system for direct communication to the referring
 provider.
