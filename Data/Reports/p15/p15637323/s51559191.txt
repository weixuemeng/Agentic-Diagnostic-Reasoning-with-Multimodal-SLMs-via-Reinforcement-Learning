                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and oxygen requirement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Although heterogeneous widespread bilateral
 interstitial opacities in conjunction with fissural thickening and a small
 pleural effusion on the right suggest pulmonary edema.  Possibility of
 coinciding pneumonia or atypical infectious etiology is not excluded, however,
 particular at noting asymmetry wherein left perihilar opacity is more
 prominent than right lung opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate generalized interstitial opacification suggesting pulmonary edema. 
 Infection as a coinciding or alternative etiology is not excluded, however. 
 Small right-sided pleural effusion.
