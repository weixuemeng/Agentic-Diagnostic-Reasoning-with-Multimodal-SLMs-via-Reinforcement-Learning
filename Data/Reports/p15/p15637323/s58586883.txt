                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HCC cirrhosis and worsening liver function,
 AIN with pulmonary edema, continued hypoxemia  // please evaluate for interval
 change in interstitial infiltrates and pleural effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overall no significant interval change from the most recent exam.  Bilateral
 extensive opacities, most prominent in the perihilar regions, could be
 secondary to pulmonary edema and underlying pneumonia.  Some degree of
 pulmonary hemorrhage given the clinical history is also possible.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is overall unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  Superimposed plate
 pleural effusions are likely but difficult to fully assess on a background
 bilateral increased opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.
