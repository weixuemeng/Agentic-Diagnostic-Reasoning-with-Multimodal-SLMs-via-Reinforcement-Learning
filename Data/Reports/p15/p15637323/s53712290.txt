 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, left-sided chest pain.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain
 low.  There is unchanged evidence of bilateral atelectatic changes at the lung
 bases.  No additional parenchymal opacities, notably non-suggesting pneumonia.
 The appearance of the left chest wall is constant, with an unchanged evidence
 of a minimally abnormal lateral contour of the sixth rib, but without cortical
 changes or cortical discontinuation.  No pleural effusions, no pneumothorax.
