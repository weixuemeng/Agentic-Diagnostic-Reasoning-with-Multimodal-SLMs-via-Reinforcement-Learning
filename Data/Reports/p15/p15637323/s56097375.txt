                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with kidney failure and volume overload with
 respiratory failure  // evaluate interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, lung volumes are slightly lower
 with associated crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Diffuse reticular
 and nodular opacities may be due to pulmonary edema in the setting of history
 of volume overload, but atypical pneumonia and widespread aspiration could
 produce a similar radiographic appearance.
