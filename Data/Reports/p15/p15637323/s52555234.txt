                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p OGT placement.  Evaluate tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier on the same day ___ at
 11:51.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The newly inserted enteric tube traverses the diaphragm into the left upper
 quadrant and crosses over into the right upper quadrant where the tip is
 located, in the stomach.  Otherwise, no significant interval change.  The ETT
 tip remains approximately 7 cm above the carina at and again could be advanced
 an additional 4 cm to avoid inadvertant extubation.  The right internal venous
 catheter tip ends in the mid SVC, unchanged.  Severe bilateral pulmonary edema
 persists and is unchanged when accounting for redistribution, most compatible
 with ARDS in the setting of and essentially normal heart size and absence of
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Newly placed OG tube tip is in the stomach.  Otherwise, no significant
 interval change.
