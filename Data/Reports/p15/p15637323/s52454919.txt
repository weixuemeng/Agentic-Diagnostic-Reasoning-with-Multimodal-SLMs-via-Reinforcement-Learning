                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with liver disease, AIN with renal failure on HD,
 intubated for hypoxemic respiratory distress, increased secretions overnight
 after acute ventilator dyssynchrony earlier in the day, ? aspiration PNA or
 other new PNA // please evaluate for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT is in standard placement.  The enteric tube traverses the diaphragm
 into the left upper quadrant and its tip is not seen. The right internal
 jugular venous catheter ends in the mid to low SVC, unchanged.  Lung volumes
 remain low lung, overall similar to the prior exam.  Day to day changes in
 bilateral interstitial opacities are most compatible with edema, slightly
 worse from the prior exam.  Atelectasis at the left lung base is overall
 unchanged.  The heart normal in size, but slightly increased.  The mediastinum
 is not widened.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild-to-moderate edema and wall slightly worse from yesterday.  Component of
 superimposed pneumonia cannot cannot be excluded.
