                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure, intubated.  // interval
 change in pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 04:52
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube present, tip approximately 7.5 cm above the carina, at the mid
 clavicular heads.  NG tube present, tip beneath diaphragm over stomach.  Right
 IJ central line tip over mid SVC.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Compared to the prior film, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 The degree of engorgement and alveolar opacity has improved.  However, this
 appearance is likely accentuated by differences in technique between the 2
 films.  Allowing for this, there is considerable residual interstitial and
 some basilar alveolar edema.  No gross effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis also
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in CHF findings, though there continues to be
 interstitial edema and some areas of alveolar edema.  No gross effusions. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.
