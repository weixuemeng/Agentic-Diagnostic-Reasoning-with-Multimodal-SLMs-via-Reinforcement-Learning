                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxemic respiratory failure, cirrhosis,
 AIN // please evaluate for interval change in infiltrates
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When accounting for redistribution and patient positioning, no significant
 interval change.  Bilateral extensive patchy opacities in the setting of
 essentially normal heart size suggests ARDS. However, some nodularity to the
 opacities could be infection.  No change in position of support devices
 including ETT (tip 7 cm from carina), right internal jugular venous catheter
 (tip in the mid SVC), and enteric tube (in stomach).  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.
