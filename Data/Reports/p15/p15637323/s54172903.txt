                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There is a mild interstitial abnormality including
 horizontal reticular lines in the right costophrenic sulcus suggesting mild
 vascular congestion, but much less striking than on the prior radiographs. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A vertebroplasty has been
 performed in a thoracolumbar vertebral body, probably L1.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion, but much less
 severe than on prior presentation.
