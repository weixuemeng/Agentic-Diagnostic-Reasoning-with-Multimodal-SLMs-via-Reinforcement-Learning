 ___-year-old male with elevated troponin.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild to moderate cardiomegaly as well as mild pulmonary edema. Right
 lower lobe and retrocardiac opacities may be atelectasis although underlying
 infection is difficult to exclude.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG. There is a small right pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure with small right pleural effusion.
 Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis, but infection is not
 excluded.
