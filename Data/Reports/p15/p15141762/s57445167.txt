 INDICATION:  NSTEMI, evaluate line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged with stable
 mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours.  There has been interval placement
 of a femoral approach Swan-___ catheter which is located in a lower right
 segmental pulmonary artery 3.5 cm beyond the border of the mediastinum.  A
 femoral-approach intraaortic balloon pump is in place projecting at the
 superior contour of the aortic arch.  Pulmonary edema is unchanged with slight
 increase in the bilateral pleural effusions.  Atelectasis is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Femoral approach Swan-Ganz positioned 3.5cm past the border of
 the mediastinum in a lower segmental pulmonary artery. Recommend withdrawal of
 Swan-Ganz by 3.5 cm.  Intraaortic balloon pump at the level of the superior
 border of the aortic arch.  Recommend withdrawal by 1 cm.  Otherwise, little
 change compared to ___.
