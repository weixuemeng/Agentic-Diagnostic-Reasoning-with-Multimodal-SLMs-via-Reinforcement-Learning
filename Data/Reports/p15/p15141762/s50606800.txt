 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with PICC line for Vancomycin therapy.

 semi-upright position.  As before, there is evidence of sternotomy, bypass
 surgery, and aortic valve replacement (porcine type).  Moderate cardiac
 enlargement as before but regressing amount of right-sided basal pleural
 density.  The previously identified right internal jugular approach sheath has
 been removed.  No pneumothorax has developed.  A previously present
 right-sided PICC line remains in unchanged position and is seen to terminate
 in the mid portion of the SVC.
