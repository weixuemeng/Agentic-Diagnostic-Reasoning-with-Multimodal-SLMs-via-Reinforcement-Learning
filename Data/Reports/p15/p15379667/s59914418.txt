                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypotension septic shock, evaluate central line
 placement and for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right IJ central venous catheter tip terminates in the low SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar
 subsegmental atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. Right IJ central venous catheter tip terminates in the low SVC.
