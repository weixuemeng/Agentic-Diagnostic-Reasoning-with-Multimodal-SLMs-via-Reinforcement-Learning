                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxemia, status post resection for adenocarcinoma of the lung,
 here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is evidence of volume loss in the left hemithorax with
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compatible with prior resection.  The left
 lung appears clear without pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural
 effusion.  The right lung is clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  There is slight leftward shift of mediastinal
 structures due to left-sided volume loss. The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings but left-sided volume loss compatible with lung
 resection.
