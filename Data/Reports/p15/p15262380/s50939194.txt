                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall ___ and residual bilateral anterior chest
 pain.  Evaluate for rib fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 evidence for pulmonary edema, pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The lower ribs are not fully included on the images.  The
 included ribs are not well penetrated, as expected on chest radiography.  No
 obvious displaced rib fracture is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence for acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If clinically warranted, dedicated rib radiographs with
 spot views of the areas of point tenderness could be helpful.
