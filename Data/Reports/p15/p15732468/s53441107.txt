                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with epigastric pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ as well as CT chest from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs remain hyperinflated consistent with patient's history of
 underlying emphysema.  Areas of calcified pleural plaques previously
 demonstrated on CT account for the focal calcific densities overlying
 bilateral lungs.  There are no focal consolidations, effusions, or
 pneumothoraces.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No acute
 fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
