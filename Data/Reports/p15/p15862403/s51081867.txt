                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new nasogastric tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the previous study from ___.
 
 The tracheostomy and right-sided PICC line and median sternotomy wires are
 unchanged in position.  There is a enteric tube whose distal tip is not well
 seen and is likely below the level of the diaphragm.  The sideport of the
 enteric tube appears to be at the GE junction and this could be advanced
 several centimeters for more optimal placement.  There are again seen diffuse
 airspace opacities throughout both lung fields, likely represents a
 combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions, right side worse than left.  No pneumothoraces are seen.
