                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Productive cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 subtle increased patchy opacity projecting over the right mid-to-lower lung
 which well could be due to atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta
 remains tortuous.  Surgical clips are noted in the upper abdomen posteriorly.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight patchy opacity projecting over the right mid-to-lower lung
 could be due to atelectasis versus infection.
