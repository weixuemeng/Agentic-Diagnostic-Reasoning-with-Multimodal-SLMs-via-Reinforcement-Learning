                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of a right-sided chest tube, a tiny right apical
 pneumothorax has developed.  Post-operative volume loss in right hemithorax
 appears similar to the prior study, in keeping with history of right upper
 lobe resection.  Atelectasis at left base is improving with a residual linear
 atelectasis remaining.  Subcutaneous emphysema in right chest wall is again
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tiny right apical pneumothorax following chest tube removal.
