                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough x 1 week  // r/o infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___ and chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 This patient has a known eventration of the left hemidiaphragm which is
 resulting in the asymmetric elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compared to
 the right.  Additionally, the mild linear opacity at the lung left lung base
 is likely a function of compressive atelectasis which was also seen on the
 prior chest CT.  The lungs are clear and the cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Known eventration of the left hemidiaphragm.
 2. No evidence of pneumonia.
