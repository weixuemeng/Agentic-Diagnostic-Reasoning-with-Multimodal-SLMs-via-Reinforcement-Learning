 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:01 PM
  Little change from earlier same day examination. Lung volumes are lower than
  the earlier exam with associated increased atelectasis and further apparent
  prominence of the pulmonary vasculature. Given the low lung volumes, there is
  no definite fluid overload or edema. Support lines appear appropriately
  positioned.
