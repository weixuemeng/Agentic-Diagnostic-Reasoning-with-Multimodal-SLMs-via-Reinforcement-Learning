                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia, however clinically looks well and
 CTAB on exam, no SOB.  // focal opacity/infiltrate?
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, a region of consolidation in
 the right upper lobe is unchanged, with adjacent cystic spaces peripherally
 attributed to paraseptal emphysema. Mild associated volume loss is present
 with shift of the adjacent mediastinal and hilar contours. Remainder of lungs
 are clear except for minimal scarring or atelectasis in the bases, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent right upper lobe consolidation potentially due to infectious
 pneumonia.  Considering discordant Clinical future, a neoplasm mimicking an
 infectious process should also be considered.  Consider CT for further
 characterization, particularly if the opacification fails to resolve on
 short-term followup radiographs
