  On the background of interstitial pulmonary edema edema there are areas of
  confluent consolidation in both lower lobes which may represent atelectasis,
  neoplasm or inflammatory process. BIlateral pleural effusions are also
  present.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic breast cancer, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there are newly appeared
 bilateral pleural effusions, multiple pulmonary nodules and evidence of
 increased interstitial structures.  Overall, the findings are suggestive of
 pulmonary metastatic disease, associated with pleural effusions, potentially
 related to lymphangitic spread of cancer.  Also new is a diffuse increase in
 bone density, notably at the level of the vertebral bodies and ribs,
 indicative of diffuse metastatic bone disease.  Unchanged cardiac silhouette.
