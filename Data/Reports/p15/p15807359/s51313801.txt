                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 13:39
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post right lower lobectomy.  Assess
 for interval change.  Increased subcutaneous air on prior study.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 10:42.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest dated ___ at 13:39 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided port remains in place, unchanged.  There continues to be a
 stable, if not slightly smaller, right apical pneumothorax.  The subcutaneous
 emphysema in the right lateral chest wall and neck soft tissues is likely
 unchanged given differences in positioning.  The bilateral ground glass and
 coalescent alveolar opacities also appear stable. Overall heart size is
 stable.  Right hemidiaphragm remains elevated and there is likely a small
 right pleural effusion.
