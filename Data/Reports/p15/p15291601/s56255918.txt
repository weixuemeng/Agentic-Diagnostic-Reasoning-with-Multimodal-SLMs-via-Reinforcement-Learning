                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left facial droop, syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous
 and demonstrates calcifications at the aortic arch.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unchanged.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Marked degenerative changes with
 anterior osteophyte formation is again noted within the imaged thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
