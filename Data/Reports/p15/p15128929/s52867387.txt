                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain for 1 day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Linear and patchy opacities in the left lung
 base most likely reflect atelectasis though pneumonia is not completely
 excluded.  Right lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar linear and patchy opacities likely reflect atelectasis though
 infection cannot be completely excluded.
