                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with acute abdominal pain, evaluate for
 free air.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No typical configurational
 abnormality is identified.  Thoracic aorta mildly widened and elongated but
 without evidence of local contour abnormalities or advanced wall
 calcifications.  There is moderate elevation of the left diaphragm, possibly
 related to moderate gas-distended stomach with fluid level.  There is some
 adjacent moderately gas-distended small and large bowel, but the entire
 abdomen cannot be evaluated.  There is no evidence of free air accumulating
 under the diaphragmatic contours, suggestive of free peritoneal area.  Also,
 the lateral view does not demonstrate any air under the diaphragmatic
 contours.
 
 The next preceding chest examination in our records is dated ___. 
 The patient was at that time status post motor vehicle accident and
 encountered at least two left-sided rib fractures.  Noteworthy is that the
 moderate left-sided diaphragmatic elevation existed already at that time.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of free abdominal air on upright chest examination.
