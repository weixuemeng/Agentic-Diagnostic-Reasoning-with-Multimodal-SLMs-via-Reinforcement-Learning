                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old female with etoh cirrhosis, etoh hepatitis being
 treated for___ transferred to the MICU for bleeding oropharngeal mass
 now with BRBPR  // Interval assessment
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 19:20
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip 1.9 cm above the carina, borderline low.  An
 enteric type tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.
 
 On the prior film, there was a right-sided PICC line that coursed cephalad
 into the neck.  This has been retracted.  The PICC line is seen over the
 axilla.  The tip is not well delineated -- it either overlies the axilla
 immediately outside the right chest wall or overlies the upper right lung.  It
 does not reach the SVC.
 
 There are moderate left-greater-than-right effusions, with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation, similar to the prior film.  This, together with the
 patient rotation, makes it difficult to evaluate the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, but no obvious change is identified.  Prominence of the left
 paratracheal soft tissues is well less well delineated due to rotation, but is
 likely still present.
 
 There is CHF with vascular plethora and vascular blurring.  Note is made of
 relative lucency at the right lung apex, but there is no lining of the lung
 edge to suggest a pneumothorax there.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube tip 1.9 cm above the carina, borderline low.
 2. PICC line has been repositioned --___ either immediately outside right
 chest or overlying upper right lung.  It does not reach the SVC.
 3. CHF with interstitial edema, similar to the prior film.
 4. Bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation , also
 similar to the prior film.
 5. Rotation limits evaluation of the mediastinum.  Prominence of left
 paratracheal soft tissues likely still present.
