                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with aspiration pneumonitis  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 17:36 pm
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 2.8 cm above the carina.  Enteric
 type tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  A PICC line
 is present, tip overlying the upper right atrium.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is enlarged cannot the aortic knob is obscured, with
 surrounding soft tissue density, unchanged.  There bilateral effusions, with
 layering,  resulting in hazy density in the lower lungs, with underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation.  The right effusion may be slightly larger. 
 Artifact overlies the upper right lung laterally, obscuring underlying
 parenchyma.  There is probable mild upper zone redistribution.  No obvious
 pneumothorax.  Mild enlargement of the azygous vein (12 mm) suggests
 right-sided engorgement .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall appearance is similar to the prior film.  Bilateral pleural effusions
 with underlying collapse and/or consolidation and prominent cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, including obscuration of the aortic knob.  Right effusion may be
 slightly larger.
 
 Right PICC line tip appears to overlie the upper  right atrium.  If clinically
 indicated, this could be retracted approximately 2.7 cm to lie in the region
 of the distal SVC/RA junction.
