                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Shortness of breath and wheezing.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 The cardiomegaly is severe.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is
 no evidence of focal consolidation, but there is presence of linear opacities,
 most likely consistent with interstitial lung abnormality.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
