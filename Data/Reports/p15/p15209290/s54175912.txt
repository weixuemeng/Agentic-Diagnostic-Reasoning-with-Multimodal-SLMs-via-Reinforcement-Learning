                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD exacerbation, intubated, sedated.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 1:03 a.m.
 
 ET tube tip is obscured by the NG tube, but lies approximately 4.6 cm above
 the carina.  NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film.
 
 There is hyperinflation, consistent with COPD.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  Hilar prominence is again seen, unchanged. Some
 patchy opacities at both lung bases are probably unchanged, allowing for
 technical differences, though possibly slightly improved.  Upper zone
 redistribution, but no overt CHF.  No frank consolidation or effusion. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall similar bibasilar opacities, possibly slightly improved. 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
