                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with COPD and worsening hypoxia.  Evaluation for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest obtained two hours
 earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single upright portable view of the chest demonstrates
 hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms, as before,
 with slight interval increase in bibasilar opacities, possibly atelectasis or
 aspiration or infection.  The heart and cardiomediastinal silhouette are
 unchanged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, possibly atelectasis; however, aspiration or
 infection can have a similar appearance.
