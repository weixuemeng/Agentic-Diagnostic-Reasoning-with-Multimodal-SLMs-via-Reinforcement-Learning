                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with COPD exacerbation, hypertension, and headache,
 status post intubation.  Evaluation for tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest obtained one and
 three hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates
 interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which terminates in the mid
 trachea, in appropriate position.  An esophageal catheter is also present,
 coursing through the gastroesophageal junction and into the stomach, out of
 view.  Otherwise, the appearance of the chest is unchanged compared to the
 prior study.
