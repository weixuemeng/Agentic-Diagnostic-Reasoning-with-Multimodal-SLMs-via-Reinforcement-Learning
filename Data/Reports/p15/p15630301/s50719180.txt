                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Wheeze and shortness of breath, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is minimal
 increased opacity in the right mid and lower lung, which could represent early
 pneumonia in the right clinical setting.  The left lung is clear.  There are
 no effusions or pneumothorax.  There is no evidence of CHF.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal increased opacity in the right mid and lower lung could
 represent early pneumonia in the right clinical setting.
