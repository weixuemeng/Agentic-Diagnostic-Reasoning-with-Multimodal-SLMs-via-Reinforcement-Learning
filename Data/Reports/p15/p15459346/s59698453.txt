                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New oxygen requirement in patient with IgA nephropathy and
 seizures s/p traumatic lumbar puncture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bedside AP radiograph of the chest shows symmetric consolidation of
 the bilateral lower lungs with the suggestion of air bronchograms.  Minimal
 pulmonary vascular congestion is also present.  The heart is not enlarged. 
 The hila and mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral lower lobe pneumonia or non-cardiogenic pulmonary
 edema, depending on the clinical context.  As per Dr. ___, ___ patient has
 missed her scheduled dialysis appointment, therefore this may represent
 pulmonary edema secondary to a derangement in fluid-electrolyte homeostasis. 
 The study can be repeated following dialysis to demonstrate improvement.
 
 NOTE:  Findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone on ___ at 10:55 am.
