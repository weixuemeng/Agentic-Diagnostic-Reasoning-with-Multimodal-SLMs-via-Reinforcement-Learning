                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease, prerenal transplant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph compared to ___:
 
 Hyperinflation and vascular deficiency in the upper lungs indicate emphysema. 
 New irregularly shaped opacity in the right mid lung laterally at the level of
 the third anterior rib is probably an area of bronchiectasis or peribronchial
 inflammation, but this would be prudent to evaluate morphologically with CT
 scanning to exclude a malignancy.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed the findings at 3:30 as soon as these findings
 were recognized.
