                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with DM s/p cardiac arrest x 3 with ROSC, now
 intubated  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT is appropriately positioned approximately 4.2 cm above the carina. 
 There is a right IJ catheter, which likely terminates within the right atrium.
 There is an NG tube, which courses below the diaphragm, however the tip is not
 visualized on this image.
 
 There is complete silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm, likely representing
 left lower lobe collapse, however superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, which may be projectional.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right IJ catheter terminating in the right atrium.
 2. Appropriately positioned ETT and NG tube.
 3. Complete left lower lobe collapse, likely due to mucous plugging.
