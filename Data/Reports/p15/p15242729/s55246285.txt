 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS:

 is mild vascular plethora, consistent with mild CHF. Faint increased opacity
 at the left lung base could reflect presence of left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  The appearance is similar to ___, although
 slightly improved.  Linear atelectasis at the left base is also noted.
 
 There is minimal subsegmental atelectasis the right base.  No gross effusion
 seen on either side, though the costophrenic angles are not sharply defined.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
