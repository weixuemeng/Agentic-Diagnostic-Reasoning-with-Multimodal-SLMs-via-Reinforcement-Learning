                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Recent pacemaker implantation with decreased breath sounds
 on left.
 
 There is no evident pneumothorax.  When compared to prior study, ___, there
 is persistent consolidation in the right middle and lower lobes  with increase
 loss of volume.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the
 patient.  Transvenous pacemaker leads which terminate in the right atrium and
 right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  Right middle lobe consolidation and increasing
 right lower lobe opacity are worrisome for pneumonia.
