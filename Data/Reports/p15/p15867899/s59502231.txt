 may be due to small effusions.  Increased opacity in the retrocardiac region
 on the lateral view is compatible with known hiatal hernia.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.

 Possible tiny bilateral pleural effusions.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
