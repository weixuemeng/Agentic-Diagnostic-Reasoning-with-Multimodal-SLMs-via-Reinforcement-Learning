                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with s/p fall with chest pain  // ? effusion,
 consolidation, evidence of traumatic injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated somewhat to the right.  Given this, no focal consolidation
 is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac
 silhouette size is borderline.  The aorta is tortuous.  The bones are
 diffusely osteopenic, limiting assessment for subtle fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient rotated somewhat to the right.  Given this, no acute cardiopulmonary
 process.  Please note that there is concern for acute into thoracic injury,
 including bony injury, chest CT is more sensitive and should be considered.
