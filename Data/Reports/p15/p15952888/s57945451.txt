 unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis, but no focal consolidations.
 2. Right mediastinal enlargement, which may be rotational, but repeat
 radiographs with improved positioning should be obtained.
 3. Moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  Repeat radiographs with improved positioning is recommended
 to rule out right mediastinal enlargement.
