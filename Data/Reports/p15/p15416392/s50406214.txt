                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low which results in limited evaluation of the lung bases. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  Heart size is
 unchanged and within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar, with prominence of the pulmonary artery suggestive of underlying
 pulmonary arterial hypertension as noted previously.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited study due to low lung volumes.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis.  Consider follow up radiographs with improved inspiratory
 effort when the patient is able to.
