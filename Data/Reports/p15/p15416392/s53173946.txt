                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath repeat portable with
 increased inspiration.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Comparison made to portable AP chest radiograph
 obtained 30 minutes earlier. Study is limited by body habitus and decreased
 penetration. Again noted are decreased lung volumes with crowding of
 bronchovascular markings.  Focal consolidation or pleural effusion cannot be
 completely evaluated at the lung bases making this study relatively
 nondiagnostic. Cardiac silhouette appears unchanged.
