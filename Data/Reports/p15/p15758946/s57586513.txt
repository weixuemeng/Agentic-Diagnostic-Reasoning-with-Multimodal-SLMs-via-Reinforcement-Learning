 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post surgery, evaluation for interval change.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant

 Moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis and small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities.  No
 pulmonary edema.
