 Persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle is seen.  Chain sutures
 are again noted in the right mid lung.  No new focal consolidation, large
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable, as are hilar contours.  Old right rib
 deformity is again seen involving posterior right eighth rib.  Known lesion in
 the right scapula is better assessed on CT.
