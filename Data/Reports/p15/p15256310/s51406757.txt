 Right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid SVC.  Interval decrease in lung

 in the right lung is new.  This may represent nodular atelectasis or
 conceivably a site of early infection.  Heart size is top normal.  No
 pneumothorax.

 Slight increase in left lower lobe atelectasis.  New nodular opacity in the
 right lower lobe may reflect nodular atelectasis, or conceivably a site of
 early infection.
