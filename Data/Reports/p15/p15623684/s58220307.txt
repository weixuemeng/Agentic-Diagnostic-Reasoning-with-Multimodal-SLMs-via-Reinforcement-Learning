                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:57 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with V-fib arrest, now on cooling protocol. 
 Evaluate pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Previously dense consolidation in the right upper lobe and less
 confluent perihilar infiltration in the left are both improving, although
 there has been an increase in milder degree of perihilar infiltration in the
 left lower lobe.  I suspect this is generally due to improving edema, but
 contributions of recent aspiration are unclear.  There is no lobar collapse. 
 The left upper abdomen is not included on the study and that makes it
 difficult to exclude an anteriorly positioned pneumothorax.  When feasible, an
 erect or semi-erect examination should be obtained to review that area.
 
 Heart size is normal, smaller than on ___.  There is no appreciable
 pleural effusion.
 
 ET tube is in standard position.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 10:10 a.m. when the study was reviewed.
