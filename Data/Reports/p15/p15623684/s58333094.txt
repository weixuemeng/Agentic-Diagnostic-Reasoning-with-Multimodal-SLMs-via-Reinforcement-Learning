                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:28 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with V-fib arrest, intubated.  Evaluate ET tube
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 ET tube is in standard placement, although the cuff distends the trachea and
 its upper margin is sharply defined by pooled secretions.  There is no good
 evidence for pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Bilateral pulmonary
 abnormalities consist largely of consolidation in the right upper lobe,
 perihilar edema on the left.  Heart size is normal.  When feasible, an upright
 chest radiograph would be helpful to evaluate the possibility of pneumothorax
 collected anteriorly.
 
 Heart size normal.
