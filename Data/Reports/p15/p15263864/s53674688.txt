                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and bodyache.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The heart is at
 the upper limits of normal size.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Central streaky opacities suggesting airway inflammation,
 including peribronchial cuffing.  Although other etiologies including mild
 fluid overload are differential considerations, inflammatory change seems more
 likely.  However, there is also the possibility of a developing perihilar
 opacity in the right lower lobe since opacities are somewhat confluent there.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggesting bronchial inflammation with potential for developing
 opacity in the right lower lobe which may indicate early development of
 pneumonia.
