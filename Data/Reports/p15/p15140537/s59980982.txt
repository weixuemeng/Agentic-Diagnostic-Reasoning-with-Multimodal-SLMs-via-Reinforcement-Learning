                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes indicate prior
 granulomatous disease.  Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the
 diaphragms suggestive of underlying COPD.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  There
 are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Evidence of prior granulomatous
 disease.  Probable COPD.
