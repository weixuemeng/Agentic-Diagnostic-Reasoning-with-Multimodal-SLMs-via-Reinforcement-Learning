                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  SSS status post dual-chamber PPM.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval placement of left-sided dual-lead pacemaker with leads extending
 to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The lateral view is suboptimal due to
 patient's overlying arm.  There is slight blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angles and trace pleural effusion may be present.  Slight
 prominence of the interstitium may be due to minimal interstitial edema versus
 chronic changes.  Cardiac silhouette is mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
