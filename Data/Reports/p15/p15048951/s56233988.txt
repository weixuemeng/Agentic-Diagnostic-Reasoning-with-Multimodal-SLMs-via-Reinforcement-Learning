                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough  // ?pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low, resulting in crowding of bronchovascular structures
 at the bases.  Given the low lung volumes, the cardiac silhouette and
 mediastinal structures are unremarkable.  No definite focal consolidation is
 identified, though not entirely excluded given low lung volumes.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  If there is persistent concern for pneumonia, repeat study
 with improved inspiratory level may be helpful for more complete assessment of
 the lung bases.
