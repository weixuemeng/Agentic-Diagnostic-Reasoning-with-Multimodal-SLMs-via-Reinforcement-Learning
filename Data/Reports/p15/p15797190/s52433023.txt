                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  End-stage renal disease with hypoxia and confusion.  Evaluate for
 change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, the retrocardiac opacity has worsened.  This
 is nonspecific and could be worsening atelectasis, though an infection is
 difficult to exclude.  Right basilar atelectasis appears slightly improved. 
 The apices of the lungs are clear.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are grossly stable.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  The heart is moderately enlarged, and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening left basilar opacity, which could be worsening atelectasis,
 though pneumonia is difficult to exclude.
 2.  Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 4:20 p.m. on ___ via telephone
 by Dr. ___ at the time the findings were discovered.
