 There is hazy opacity at the right lung base, which could represent

 the left mid lung.  Minimal pulmonary vascular edema is again seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of small left and moderate right pleural
 effusions with a hazy opacity at the right lung base, which could represent
 compressive atelectasis, but consolidation is not excluded.
