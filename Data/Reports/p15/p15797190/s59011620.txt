                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable chest radiograph.  Exam is limated by portable
 technique, low lung volumes and body habitus.  There is apparent elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm.  Bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis and
 overlying soft tissues with small efusions not excluded.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent but likely accentuated for reason
 above.  Old, potentially post traumatic changes seen at the lateral right
 clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Low lung volumes and probable bibasilar atelectasis, small effusions are
 possible.  Two view may offer additional detail if patient is amenable.
