                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is moderately enlarged but accentuated by
 the low lung volumes.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion with
 ill-defined patchy opacities in the lung bases, possibly atelectasis but
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  There may be trace bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Left subclavian vascular
 stent is in unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary vascular congestion, possible bilateral
 trace pleural effusions, and bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly reflecting
 atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
