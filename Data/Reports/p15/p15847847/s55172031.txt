                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with history of lobectomy for lung cancer, with
 crackles on lung exam  // ?infection vs edema vs atelectasis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No priors available for comparison.  The patient is rotated to the left. 
 There is near complete opacification of the left hemithorax, with shift of the
 mediastinum into the left hemithorax.  A surgical clip is seen in the left
 upper lung.  The right lung is clear, with no focal consolidation, effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is difficult to assess given mediastinal shift.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lung is clear.  Left lung is not well evaluated due to patient rotation
 and near complete opacification of left hemithorax with mediastinal shift to
 the left.  Although patient has a history of left lobectomy, without prior
 imaging available for comparison, chronicity of these findings and exclusion
 acute left lung process is difficult.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend repeat radiographs with patient sitting straight
 up.  If patient's symptoms persist and repeat radiograph are unrevealing,
 patient may require CT for further evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
