                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable radiograph of chest was compared with a prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post extubation.  Bilateral lungs are remarkable for
 prominent vascular markings.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are slightly prominent.  Pleural effusion if any is minimal on the
 left side.  Comparison for changed or new appearance of left effusion could
 not be made with the previous radiograph because of the external devices
 obscuring the left lower lung and the costophrenic angle region. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Status post-extubation with bilateral prominent lung vascular
 markings and prominant mediastinum suggesting mild vascular and mediastinal
 congestion. Since this finding can be seen both following post extubation and
 in volume over load, followup radiograph is recommended to monitor the lung
 changes.
