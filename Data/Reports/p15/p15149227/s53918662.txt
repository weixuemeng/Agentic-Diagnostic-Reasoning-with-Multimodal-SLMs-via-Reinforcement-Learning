 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of right PICC terminates in the right brachiocephalic vein
 approximately 3 cm from the medial aspect of the clavicle, previously measured
 as 1 cm from this location on the previous radiograph.  Tracheostomy tube
 remains in the standard position.  Heart size is upper limits of normal
 allowing for technique, and bilateral pulmonary opacities have nearly resolved
 in the interval.  Right hemidiaphragm is partially obscured, possibly by a
 small right pleural effusion.
