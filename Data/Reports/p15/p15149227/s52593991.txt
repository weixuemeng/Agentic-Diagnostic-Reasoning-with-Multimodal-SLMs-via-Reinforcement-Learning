 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain
 unchanged.  The tracheostomy tube is in constant position.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema.  Minimal increase in radiodensity
 at the right lung base, likely atelectatic in origin, and visually exaggerated
 by rightward patient rotation.  No convincing evidence of new parenchymal
 opacity.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
