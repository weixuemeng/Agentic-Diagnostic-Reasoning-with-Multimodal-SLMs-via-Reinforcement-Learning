                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure, status post tracheostomy.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.4 cm above the carina.  A
 right-sided PICC line is present, tip obscured, but overlying the SVC/RA
 junction.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, cardiac silhouette is
 borderline.  Patchy opacity at the left base is similar to the prior film. 
 There has been slight interval clearing of the right cardiophrenic opacity. 
 No gross effusion.  No new infiltrate identified.
