 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with encephalitis, prolonged

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in

 similar study of ___.  On the present examination, the patient
 is slightly rotated to the right, which accounts for somewhat different
 presentation of the tracheostomy cannula.  It is seen to terminate in
 unchanged position in the trachea.  No pneumothorax is present.  The heart
 size remains unchanged and is within normal limits.  No pulmonary congestive
 pattern and no new acute infiltrates.  Lateral pleural sinuses remain free.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings in presence of tracheostomy.  No
 pneumothorax.
