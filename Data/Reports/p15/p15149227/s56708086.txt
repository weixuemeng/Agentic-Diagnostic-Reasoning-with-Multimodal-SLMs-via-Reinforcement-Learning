                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ years old woman with apneic episodes, assess for lung
 pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right subclavian PICC and tracheostomy tube are unchanged and in
 standard position.  Lung volume is persistently low with new right lung base
 opacity, probably due to atelectasis. Heart size is apparently increased due
 to low lung volumes.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Severe
 gastric distension might improve with NG tube placement.
