                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 12:41 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with encephalitis, now with question sepsis,
 question pulmonary edema, fluid overload, infectious process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 19:37.
 
 Portable semi-upright chest film ___ at 12:45 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy tube unchanged in position with the tip approximately 4.5 cm
 above the carina.  Left internal jugular central line has been placed with its
 tip likely within the proximal right atrium near the cavoatrial junction. 
 Lung volumes remain low.  There is an airspace consolidation involving
 predominantly the right upper lobe, which would be worrisome for pneumonia. 
 There is crowding of the vasculature.  A more patchy opacity is also seen in
 both bases which could reflect areas of pneumonia or aspiration, less likely
 atelectasis.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax is appreciated, although
 the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi-upright
 technique.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged
 given patient rotation on the current study.  There is possibly a portion of a
 PICC line visualized with the tip projecting over the mid portion of the right
 scapula.
