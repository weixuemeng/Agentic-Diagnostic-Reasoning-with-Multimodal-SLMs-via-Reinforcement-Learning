 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 446 
 
 INDICATION:  Status post seizure with trach, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at 456.

 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy tube and left subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position.
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Lung volumes are
 somewhat diminished, but the lungs are grossly clear suggesting that the
 previously described patchy opacities likely reflected atelectasis.  No
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.
