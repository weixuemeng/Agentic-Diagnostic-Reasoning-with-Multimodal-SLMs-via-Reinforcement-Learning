                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.  Single-view.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in place in standard position.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  Lung volumes remain low which exaggerates the heart
 size and pulmonary vasculature although there appears to be residual mild
 pulmonary edema.  There is focal consolidation in the extreme right lung base
 which may be secondary to atelectasis however infection cannot be excluded. 
 There is no large pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  An upper
 enteric tube remains in position with the tip excluded from imaging.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes, persistent mild interstitial edema and new right lung base
 consolidation which may be secondary to atelectasis however infection cannot
 be excluded in the correct clinical circumstance.
