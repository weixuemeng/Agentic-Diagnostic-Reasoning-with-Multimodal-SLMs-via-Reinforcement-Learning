                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Drop in hematocrit, suspected pneumothorax.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 The tracheostomy is in place, approximately 4.3 cm above the carina.  Heart
 size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  There is diffuse new interstitial
 opacity involving the lungs, most likely consistent with interval development
 of interstitial pulmonary edema, but small focal opacity in the left upper
 lobe should be followed to exclude the possibility of developing infection. 
 Previously seen left lower lobe consolidation has improved, consistent with
 improvement of atelectasis or aspiration.  Tubes and lines are unremarkable in
 appearance.
