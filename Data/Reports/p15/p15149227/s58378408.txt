                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position.  Right PICC
 terminates in the right subclavian vein approximately 1 cm from the medial
 aspect of the clavicle.  Cardiac silhouette is prominent in size but stable
 compared to prior study, and is accompanied by new pulmonary vascular
 congestion and bilateral poorly-defined reticular and nodular opacities. 
 Although possibly due to pulmonary edema, the appearance is more suggestive of
 multifocal aspiration or evolving bronchopneumonia.
