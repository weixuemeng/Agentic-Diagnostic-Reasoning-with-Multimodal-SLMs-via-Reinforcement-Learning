                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:05 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with NMDA receptor antibodies and pneumonia,
 assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 3:41.
 
 A portable AP semi-erect chest film, ___ at 4:06 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Tracheostomy tube, left subclavian central line and dual-lumen right internal
 jugular catheter are unchanged in position.  Heart is upper limits of normal
 given portable technique.  Lung volumes remain low.  Streaky linear opacity at
 the left base likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal airspace
 consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No pleural effusions or pulmonary
 edema.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.
