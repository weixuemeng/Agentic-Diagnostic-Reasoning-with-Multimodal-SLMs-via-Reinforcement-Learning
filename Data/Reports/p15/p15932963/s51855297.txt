                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fall and possible lung
 malignancy, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___ and CT of the chest
 with contrast performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate a previously
 5.8 x 3.6 cm left upper lobe lung mass, now measuring 8.7 x 6.5 cm with
 interval cavitation and a new air-fluid level, which presumably represents a
 cavitated bronchogenic carcinoma with necrotic contents.  Superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.  This lesion abuts the anterior left hilus.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac silhouette is
 normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 The aortic knob is partially calcified without dilatation.
