                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with tracheal stenosis.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Left mid lung opacity appears to be more pronounced on the prior study and
 although might potentially reflect a combination of scarring with calluses,
 can also reflect interval development of focal area of infection.  Rest of the
 lungs are clear.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance.
