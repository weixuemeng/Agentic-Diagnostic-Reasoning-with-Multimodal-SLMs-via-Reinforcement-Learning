                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of tracheostomy with hypoxemia, respiratory failure. 
 Evaluate for infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The malpositioned Dobbhoff tube has been removed since yesterday.  The
 tracheostomy tube has been replaced or repositioned, ending 5.3 cm above the
 carina.  Lung volumes are improved since yesterday and left basilar
 atelectasis has improved.  Increased heterogeneous opacity at the right base
 could be related to aspiration or asymmetric edema.  Indistinctness of the
 pulmonary vasculature is consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval removal of Dobbhoff tube and replacement or repositioning of
 tracheostomy tube in satisfactory position.
 
 2. Increased pulmonary vascular congestion and right lower lung opacity,
 either aspiration or asymmetric pulmonary edema.
