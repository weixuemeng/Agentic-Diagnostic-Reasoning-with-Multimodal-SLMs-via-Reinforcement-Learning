                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 2:45 A.M. ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with a history of tracheomalacia, hypoxemia and
 respiratory failure.  ET tube removed and tracheostomy replaced.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 12:35 a.m.:
 
 Tracheal T-tube has been replaced with a tracheostomy, rotated only slightly
 off the midline tracheal axis.  Adequacy should be assessed by direct
 inspection.  Lungs are low in volume, and there is at least some new
 atelectasis, or consolidation, in the right upper lobe indicated by elevation
 of the minor fissure and opacification in the anterior segment of the upper
 lobe above it.  A moderate-sized hiatus hernia should not be mistaken for a
 large region of left lower lobe atelectasis.  Pleural thickening and rib
 fractures are noted in the left mid hemithorax laterally.
