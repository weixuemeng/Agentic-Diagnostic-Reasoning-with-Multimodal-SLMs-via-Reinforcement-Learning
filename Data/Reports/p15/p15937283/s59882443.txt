 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with a history of left lower
 quadrant pain, nausea and vomiting, and leukocytosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and fairly well-aerated lungs.  An opacity in the lower right lung
 corresponds to an opacity seen on CT chest from the same day, felt to
 represent bronchial mucoid impaction.  No other focal consolidation is
 identified.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity in the right lower lobe corresponds to an area felt to represent
 bronchial mucoid impaction on CT from the same day.  No other focal
 consolidation identified.
