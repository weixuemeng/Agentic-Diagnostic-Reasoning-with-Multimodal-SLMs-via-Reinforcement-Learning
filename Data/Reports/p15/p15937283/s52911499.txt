                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness and hypotension, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are somewhat low in
 volume with right lower lung opacity, slightly less conspicuous than the prior
 study.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged with multiple coronary stents noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Slightly decreased conspicuity of right lower lung opacity, which
 again likely reflects atelectasis, though infection remains a consideration.
