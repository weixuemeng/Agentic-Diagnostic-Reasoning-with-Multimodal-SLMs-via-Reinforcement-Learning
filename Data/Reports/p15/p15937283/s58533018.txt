                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fatigue, weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Faint lateral right middle lobe opacity could be due to underlying atelectasis
 or related to overlying nipple shadow, however developing consolidation is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  The left lung is clear.  No
 pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Evidence of coronary stenting is
 again seen particularly on the lateral view.  No overt pulmonary edema is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Faint lateral right middle lobe opacity could be due to underlying atelectasis
 or related to overlying nipple shadow, however developing consolidation is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Consider repeat with nipple
 markers for further evaluation.
