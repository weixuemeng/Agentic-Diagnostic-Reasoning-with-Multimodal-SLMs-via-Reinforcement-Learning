                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with persistent cough.  // r/o PNA      r/o PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to most recent prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 Overall lung volumes are hyperinflated, as before, suggesting chronic small
 airway obstruction.  New opacification in the lingula obscures the left heart
 border.  On the lateral view this looks like it could be atelectasis or
 consolidation due to pneumonia.  Careful followup is needed to document
 clearing and to exclude small peripheral endobronchial obstruction.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion or evidence of central lymph
 node enlargement.  Heart size is normal.
