                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 629  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with increasing oxygen requirement. 
 Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at 626.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film dated ___ at 6:29am is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Spinal hardware overlies the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine,
 limiting evaluation of the mediastinal contours.  A left subclavian central
 line and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position.  The endotracheal
 tube position cannot be assessed given that it is obscured by the spinal
 hardware.  Streaky opacities in both upper medial lobes are again seen and
 likely reflect post-inflammatory changes with associated bronchiectasis,
 although an acute infectious process cannot be entirely excluded given the
 absence of more remote comparison studies.  There is now apparent obscuration
 of the right costophrenic sulcus, but this is felt to likely be positional
 rather than representing an effusion.  Hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged with the heart being mildly enlarged.  Streaky opacities at the left
 base likely reflect atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.
