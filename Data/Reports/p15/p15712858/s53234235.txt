                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Metastatic prostate cancer.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.  CT of the abdomen is also available from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is marked increase in opacification of the right lower lobe
 with a component of volume loss.  A less extensive opacity is also developing
 in the left retrocardiac area compared to the prior radiographs, although not
 necessarily changed from the more recent CT, to which it is difficult to
 compare precisely due to differences in technique.  L1 and L3 compression
 deformities appear unchanged, although not well visualized.  The bones appear
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacities at both lung bases are worrisome for pneumonia;
 aspiration could also be considered in the appropriate setting.  No evidence
 for congestive heart failure.
