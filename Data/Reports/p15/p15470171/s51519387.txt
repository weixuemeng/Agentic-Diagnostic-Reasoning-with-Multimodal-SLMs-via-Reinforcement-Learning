                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with AAA rupture and line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable semi-upright view of the chest was obtained. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Allowing for slightly rotated
 positioning, a right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter or sheath
 terminates in the upper SVC.  Lungs are grossly clear, without CJF or focal
 infiltrate.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Hyperinflation is
 suggestive of background COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the
 upper SVC.
