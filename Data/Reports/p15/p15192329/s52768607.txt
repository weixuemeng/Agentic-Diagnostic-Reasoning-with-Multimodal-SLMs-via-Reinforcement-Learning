 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with chest pain x 3 days.  Evaluate

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior relevant imaging is available on PACS at the time of
 this dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No focal consolidation, effusion, edema, or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal
 in size.  The mediastinum is not widened.  Aortic knob calcifications are

 is significant anterior wedging of a mid thoracic vertebral body with greater
 than ___% loss of vertebral body height anteriorly ; this is age indeterminate
 in the absence of prior imaging.  Multi-level degenerative changes are noted
 otherwise with anterior osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Significant (>___%) loss of anterior vertebral body height of a mid
 thoracic vertebral body, age-indeterminate in the absence of priors. 
 Correlate with clinical assessment and any prior exams if available.  MR could
 be performed to determine acuity if clinically necessary.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Correlate with clinical assessment and any prior exams if
 available for mid thoracic vertebral body wedge fracture.  MRI could be
