                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lower to abscess over right clavicle.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle seen on the frontal
 view, not substantiated on the lateral view, which may be due to minor
 atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  The distal aspect of the
 right clavicle is not included on the image.  The imaged portion of the
 clavicle appears intact without cortical destruction.  However, if there is
 high clinical concern for clavicular involvement, particularly of the distal
 right clavicle, recommend dedicated views of the right clavicle.
