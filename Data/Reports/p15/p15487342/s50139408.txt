                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Pneumonia, worsening hypoxia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal contours are stable. 
 Widespread interstitial opacities appear to be progressed since the prior
 study and given the rapid change are most likely concerning for interval
 development of pulmonary edema.  Atelectasis at the left lower lung appears to
 be more pronounced than on the prior study.  Bilateral pleural effusions
 cannot be excluded.
