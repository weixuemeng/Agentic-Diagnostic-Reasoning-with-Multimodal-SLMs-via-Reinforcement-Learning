                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated in the setting of likely overdose now presenting with
 fever.  Evaluate for interval change or infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ and ___. 
 Chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: An endotracheal tube is 5.7 cm above the carina.  The course of the
 enteric tube has cannot confidently be identified secondary to overlying soft
 tissues.  A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
 
 There is improved aeration at the right lung base, however, persistent
 perihilar and bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Improved, albeit persistent, atelectasis.
 2. Enteric tube course cannot be confidently visualized.  If confirmation is
 required, conventional radiographs would be recommended.
