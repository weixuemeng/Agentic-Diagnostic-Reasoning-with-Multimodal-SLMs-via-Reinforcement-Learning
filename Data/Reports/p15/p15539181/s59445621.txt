  2. Bibasilar opacities may represent early consolidations or atelectasis
  depending on the clinical setting.
  3. Rightward tracheal deviation by an enlarged left thyroid lobe.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with N/V and SOB, evaluate for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding, particularly on the lateral
 view.  Obscuration of the lateral left hemidiaphragm most likely represents
 atelectasis.  Airspace opacity in the medial right lower lung also likely
 represents atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. 
 Rightward deviation of the trachea at the level of thoracic inlet is unchanged
 from prior studies and caused by an enlarged left thyroid lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes causing bronchovascular crowding.
 2. Bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis.
 3. Rightward tracheal deviation by an enlarged left thyroid lobe.
