 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with leukocytosis and fever.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A 2cm nodule
 in the right upper lobe and a left lower lobe mass are again seen, as noted on
 prior PET CT, compatible with patient's known lung cancer.  There is no new
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is markedly
 enlarged, in part due to known pericardial effusion.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.  There is
 no free air under the diaphragm. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia. Bilateral masses compatible with patient's known
 lung cancer.
