 FINDINGS:
 
 AP view of the chest.  There is a new diffuse hazy opacity of the right
 hemithorax as well as fluid in the minor fissure.  A hazy opacity overlying
 the left lower hemithorax is also seen.  These likely represent new pleural
 effusions layering posteriorly given that the patient is semi supine.  No
 pneumothorax.  No definite focal consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal hilar
 contours are stable. Mitral annular calcifications are seen.  Tiny amount of
 pneumomediastinum in the left neck and adjacent to the aortic arch. Stent is
 seen in the thoracic aorta and kyphoplasty changes are seen in the upper
 lumbar spine.  Left-sided pacemaker wires are unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New moderate right and small left pleural effusions layering posteriorly and
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Tiny amount of pneumomediastinum.
