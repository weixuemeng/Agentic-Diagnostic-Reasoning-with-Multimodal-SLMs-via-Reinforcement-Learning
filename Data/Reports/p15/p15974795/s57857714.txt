                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Status post AVR, evaluation for right lower lobe collapse.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.
 With respect to the right lower lobe opacity, limited to the right middle
 lobe.  The opacity is likely caused by a combination of right pleural effusion
 and mild atelectasis.  Left retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.  Minimal
 left pleural effusion is present.  No fluid overload.  The left pectoral
 pacemaker and its leads are in constant position.
