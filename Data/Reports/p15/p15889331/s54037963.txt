                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ basilar and L vertebral artery occlusion and L cerebellar
 stroke, s/p trach, now with desatuaration to mid ___'s and increasing
 suctioning requirements.  // eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position.  Right PICC ends at the low
 SVC.  Compared to the prior study, performed 1 day prior there is increased
 atelectasis in the right upper lobe, new linear opacities in the mid left lung
 and the previously present left basilar opacities have increased.  The new
 left lung opacities likely represent atelectasis and less likely aspiration.
 No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is identified. The mediastinal
 contours are stable.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in right upper lobe atelectasis.  New left lung opacity
 likely represents atelectasis and less likely aspiration.
