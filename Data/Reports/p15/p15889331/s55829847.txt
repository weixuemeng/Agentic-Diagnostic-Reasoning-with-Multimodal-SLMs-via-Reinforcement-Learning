                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with basilar arterial occlusion, on vent
 with ET tube, check for a new-onset hypoxia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 547.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina.  The
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting
 over the stomach but the sideport may be close to the gastroesophageal
 junction.  Clinical correlation would be advised.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable given differences in patient rotation.  There
 is a persistent opacity in the left lower lobe which could reflect
 atelectasis, although pneumonia should be considered.  No pleural effusions. 
 No pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
