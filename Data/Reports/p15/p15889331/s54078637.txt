                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the recent study, there has been little change in
 the appearance of the chest except for a worsening left retrocardiac opacity
 which could reflect atelectasis and/or infectious consolidation accompanied by
 an adjacent persistent small left pleural effusion.
