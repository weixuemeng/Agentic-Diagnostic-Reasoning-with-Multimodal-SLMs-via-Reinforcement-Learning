                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of stroke ___, recent aspiration
 pneumonia now with likely C difficile, J tube difficulties, coarse lung sounds
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous and
 diffusely calcified.  Previously noted widening of the superior mediastinal
 contour has improved.  Hilar contours are normal, and pulmonary vasculature is
 within normal limits.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are not substantially
 changed in the interval.  Subsegmental atelectasis is seen within the right
 middle lobe.  Minimal patchy opacity is also seen within both lower lobes.  No
 pneumothorax or focal consolidation is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Partially imaged is a percutaneous jejunostomy catheter in the
 upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
