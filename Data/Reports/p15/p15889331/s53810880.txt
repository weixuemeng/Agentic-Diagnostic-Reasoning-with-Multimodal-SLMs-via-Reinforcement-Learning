 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p trach and dobhoff  // check trach and dobhoff
 position
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Three views of the chest are submitted.
 
 First view shows Feeding tube with the wire stylet in place in the periphery
 of the right bronchial tree probably in the middle lobe.  This is responsible
 for new right middle and lower lobe atelectasis.  Second view shows the
 feeding tube lodged in either the upper airway or upper esophagus above the
 level of the clavicles.  Right middle and lower lobe are still collapsed. 
 Third view shows the feeding tube folded in the mid esophagus. Right middle
 and lower lobe are still collapsed.
 
 When this examination was reviewed, the subsequent chest radiograph, 12:51,
 showing the feeding tube repositioned in the stomach had already been
 performed, and direct NOTIFICATION of the referring physician was no longer
 necessary.
