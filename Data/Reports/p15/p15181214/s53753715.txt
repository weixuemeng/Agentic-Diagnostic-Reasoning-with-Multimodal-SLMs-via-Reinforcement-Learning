                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post brain biopsy, now with fever.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  New ill-defined opacities in the left
 lower lobe could be due to atelectasis and/or aspiration.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
