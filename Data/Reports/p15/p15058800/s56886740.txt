                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Myeloma and amyloidosis with new fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is bibasilar
 opacification with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragms and blunting of the
 costophrenic angles, worse on the right.  This could reflect atelectasis and
 pleural effusion.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia, especially on the right, would have to be considered.
