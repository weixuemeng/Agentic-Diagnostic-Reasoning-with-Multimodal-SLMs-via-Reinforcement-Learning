  1.  Moderate cardiomegaly with cephalization of vasculature, and small
  bilateral pleural effusions is consistent with pulmonary edema.
  
  2. Persistent right lower lobe opacity is unchanged from ___ and
  most consistent with atelectasis.  Clinical correlation is recommended to
  assess for superimposed infection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multiple myeloma, ___% O2 on RA, history of
 dyspnea  // pulm edema vs infection vs effusion      pulm edema vs infection
 vs effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Bibasilar opacifications, more prominent on the right, are consistent with a
 combination of pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis at the bases.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
