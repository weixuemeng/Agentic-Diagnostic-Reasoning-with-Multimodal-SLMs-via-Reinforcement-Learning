  ETT ends 6.2 cm above the carina.  Left PICC ends in the mid SVC.  Enteric

  worsening of bilateral lower lung opacities which may represent a combination
  of pleural effusion and consolidation.  Increased pulmonary edema. No
  pneumothorax.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PNA, now with worsening resp status
 requiring repeat intubation.  // ETT placement, pneumothorax? Other acute
 change?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube tip is 6.2 cm above the carinal.  NG tube passes below the diaphragm
 terminating in the stomach.  Left PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC. 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable but there is interval progression of
 multifocal consolidations since the previous study concerning for interval
 development of severe pulmonary edema or potentially pulmonary hemorrhage
 superimposed on pre-existing pulmonary consolidations.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions are moderate, unchanged.
