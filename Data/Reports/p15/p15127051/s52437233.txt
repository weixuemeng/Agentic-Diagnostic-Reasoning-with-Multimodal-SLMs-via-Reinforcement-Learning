                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cardiac arrest
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating approximately 1.3 cm from the
 carina.  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 present.  The aorta is tortuous.  Widening of the superior mediastinum may be
 due to low lung volumes and supine technique.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, however subtle lucency within the
 left lung base could suggest a small left pneumothorax.  No displaced
 fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Low lying endotracheal tube terminating approximately 1.3 cm from the
 carina.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 3. Widened superior mediastinum may be due to supine positioning and AP
 technique.  Consider CT with contrast for further assessment if there is
 concern for vascular injury.
 4. Patchy opacities within the lung bases, potentially atelectasis but
 aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.
