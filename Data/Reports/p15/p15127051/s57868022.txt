                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with rib fractures and pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 16:41 and CT torso ___ at 17:27
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Subtle lucency within the left lung base with deep sulcus sign corresponds to
 the pneumothorax better seen on the previous chest CT.  Numerous anterior
 bilateral rib fractures are also better appreciated on the prior CT.  There
 has been no interval change in the cardiac or mediastinal contour, and no
 rightward shift of midline structures is appreciated.  The endotracheal tube
 has been withdrawn and now terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina. 
 There has been interval placement of an enteric tube with tip at the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Left-sided pacemaker device is again noted.  Lung
 volumes remain low with crowding of bronchovascular structures.  Patchy
 opacities within the lung bases likely reflect a combination of atelectasis
 and aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Subtle lucency within the left lung base with deep sulcus sign corresponds
 to the previously seen pneumothorax on CT and overall, findings appear
 unchanged compared to the chest radiograph performed earlier in the day.  No
 significant contralateral mediastinal shift.
 2. Interval withdrawal of the endotracheal tube which is now in standard
 position.  Enteric tube has been placed with tip at the gastroesophageal
 junction and should be advanced for optimal positioning within the stomach.
 3. Bibasilar patchy opacities compatible with a combination of atelectasis and
 aspiration.
 4. Known bilateral anterior rib fractures are better seen on the recent CT.
