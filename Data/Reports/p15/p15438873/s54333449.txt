                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in standard position,
 and cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for technique.  A
 subtle area of opacity has developed in the left retrocardiac region, but
 lungs are otherwise clear, and no acute pleural abnormalities were detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left retrocardiac opacity, possibly due to aspiration given
 history of recent suspected aspiration event.  Atelectasis and infectious
 pneumonia could produce a similar radiographic appearance.
