                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Anorexia, Dobbhoff placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 A Dobbhoff tube is present -- the radiopaque tip overlies the upper stomach. 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is no CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion. 
 Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy is detected.  No free air is seen beneath the diaphragm.  No
 pneumomediastinum is detected. No splenic shadow is detected on this film,
 although this finding depends on the specific intra-abdominal position of the
 spleen. The patient is skeletally immature, with unfused physes along the
 medial clavicles.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Dobbhoff tube tip over upper stomach.  
 2) No acute pulmonary process identified.
