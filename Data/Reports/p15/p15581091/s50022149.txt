                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiograph of the chest.  No prior chest
 radiographs are available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  A very small suspicious focal opacity at the right lung base is
 indeterminate for lung infection.  The rest of the lungs are clear.  No
 pleural effusion.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspicious focal opacity at the right lung base is indeterminate
 for infection.  Followup CT at four weeks is recommended to assess for
 interval change.
