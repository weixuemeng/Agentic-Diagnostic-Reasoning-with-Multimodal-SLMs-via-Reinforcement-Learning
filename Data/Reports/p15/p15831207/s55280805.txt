 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior or chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding.  There has been interval
 improvement in the diffuse bilateral heterogeneous airspace opacities. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in size.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged. Nasogastric tube ends in the neo-esophagus. The
 endotracheal tube ends 4.3 cm from the carina.  Right-sided PICC line is
 looped and coiled, and ends in the axilla. Right-sided Port-A-Cath ends at the
 distal SVC. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval improvement in diffuse bilateral airspace opacities and decrease
 in size of bilateral pleural effusions.
 2. Right-sided PICC line is looped and coiled, and ends in the axilla. This
 should be replaced prior to use.
