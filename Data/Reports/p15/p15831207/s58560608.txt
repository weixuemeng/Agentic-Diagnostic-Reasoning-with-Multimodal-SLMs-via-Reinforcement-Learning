                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p esophagectomy // interval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding.  There is bibasilar atelectasis,
 and a small right-sided pleural effusion. Increased pulmonary vascular
 congestion is consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. A chest tube
 projects over the right hemi thorax.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath and the distal
 SVC. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The neoesophagus
 is fluid-filled.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased pulmonary vasculature is consistent with mild interstitial edema.
