                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with large pleural effusion, worsening hypoxia 
 // ? worsening effusion or other
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through one ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall heterogeneous pulmonary opacification has worsened progressively since
 ___. The time course is most consistent with pulmonary edema, but there
 are findings to suggest that more than edema may be at work. Specifically the
 heart is not enlarged and some areas of opacification have a distinctly
 nodular quality, particularly in the left mid and lower lung zones. These
 findings are concerning for widespread infection, concurrent with edema.
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable since ___.  The neo
 esophagus still retains fluid suggesting dysfunction. The esophagogastric
 stent has not migrated from its original position.
