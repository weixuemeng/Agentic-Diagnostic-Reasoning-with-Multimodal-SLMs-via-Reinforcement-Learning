 look for leak or changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 22:16
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours in this patient with a
 neo esophagus. Bibasilar patchy opacities which have increased suggestive of
 worsening atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be
 considered in the correct clinical setting. The right subclavian Port-A-Cath
 is unchanged in position. No evidence of pulmonary edema, pneumothorax or
 pneumomediastinum. Probable small bilateral effusions versus chronic pleural
 thickening given blunting of both costophrenic angles on the lateral
 projection.
