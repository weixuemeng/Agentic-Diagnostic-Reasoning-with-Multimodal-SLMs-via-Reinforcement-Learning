                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with atrial flutter.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable upright radiograph through the chest demonstrates an
 esophageal stent in the location of a gastric pull through.  New since prior
 examination, the neoesophagus appears opacified, previously air filled on
 prior radiograph ___.  Obscuration of bilateral costophrenic
 angles is consistent with bibasilar pleural effusions.  Mild pulmonary edema
 is present which obscures known metastatic nodules. There is a right
 Port-A-Cath in unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Previously air-filled neo esophagus is opacified raising concern for an
 obstruction.
 2. Bibasilar pleural effusions are largely unchanged when compared to prior
 study dated ___ allowing for differences in image acquisition.
 3. Mild pulmonary edema.
