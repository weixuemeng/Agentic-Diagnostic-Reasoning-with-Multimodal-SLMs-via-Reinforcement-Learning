 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Caliber of the moderately dilated neo esophagus is not appreciably changed,
 although there is no longer a fluid collection in the lower midline component
 which may indicate relief of an impediment to emptying. Atelectasis at the
 lung bases is mild. Heart size difficult to assess because of the neo
 esophagus behind it, but there is no indication of cardiac decompensation in
 lungs.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Right subclavian central venous
 infusion catheter ends low in the SVC.
