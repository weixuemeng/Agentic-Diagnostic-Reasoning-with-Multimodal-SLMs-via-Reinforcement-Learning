                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary embolism, OG tube placed  // OG
 tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs between ___ and ___, chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The enteric tube extends to at least the body of the stomach, with its distal
 tip not captured on the current study.  Right PICC terminates near the low
 SVC.  Endotracheal tube tip lies 4.7 cm above the carina.
 
 Extensive multifocal pneumonia is unchanged.  When interpreted in conjunction
 with the prior CTA performed on ___, there are additional
 background groundglass opacities, which are not entirely explained by an
 infectious process.  A drug reaction could be considered.  There may be a
 small pleural effusion on the left.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 top-normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Enteric tube extends at least the body of stomach.  Stable positioning of
 the endotracheal tube and right PICC.
 2. Overall unchanged multifocal pneumonia.  Additional groundglass opacities
 are unlikely to represent an infectious process, and could reflect a
 superimposed drug reaction.
