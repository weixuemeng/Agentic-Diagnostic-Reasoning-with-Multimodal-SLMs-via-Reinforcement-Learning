                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient, status post anterior/posterior spinal
 fusion surgery who experienced acute lethargy and became transiently
 unresponsive, evaluate for cause of acute lethargy and unresponsiveness.
 
 FINDINGS:  An AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  High positioned diaphragms indicate poor inspirational
 effort and obscure cardiac borders in part.  Significant cardiac enlargement,
 however, is unlikely.  Unremarkable appearance of mediastinal structures
 including contours of thoracic aorta.  Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.
 No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present, and the
 lateral pleural sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of cardiovascular or pulmonary abnormalities on
 single view AP chest examination.
