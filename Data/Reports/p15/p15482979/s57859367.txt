                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Urinary retention and back pain.  Pre-op, evaluate for infection.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal radiographs of the chest demonstrate normal heart size.  The hilar
 contours are normal. Stable widening of the upper mediastium most likely
 reflects fat; however an enlarged thyroid could have the same appearance. The
 lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib
 fracture identified.
