 possibly with some locualtion. Medial basilar opacity has increased in the
 left lower lobe, superimposed on chronic interstitial changes.  There is no
 pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from prior exam. A
 left anterior chest wall pacemaker is seen with intact leads in appropriate
 positions. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips are noted.
