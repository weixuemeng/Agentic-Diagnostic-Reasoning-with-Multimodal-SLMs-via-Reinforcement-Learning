 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and cough for four days.

 are otherwise clear and there is no effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits, noting atherosclerotic calcifications at
 the aortic arch.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
