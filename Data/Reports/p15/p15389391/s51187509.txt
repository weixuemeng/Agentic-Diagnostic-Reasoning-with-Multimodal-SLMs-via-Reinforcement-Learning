 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): ___ ___ ___ 11:47 AM
  1. Gradual mediastinal widening; consider a follow-up radiograph in supine
  positioning.
  2. Mediastinal contours demonstrate the lymphadenopathy and contained
  dissection/pseudoaneurysm better seen on prior CT.
  3. Moderate left pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis and mild
  pulmonary edema; underlying infection cannot be excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with multifocal pneumonia.
 
 STUDY:  Supine portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest
 CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube tip sits between the clavicular heads.  An
 endogastric tube courses inferiorly, out of field of view.  The right-sided
 PICC tip sits at the cavoatrial junction.  The cardiomediastinal contours are
 exaggerated by position and technique, although their apparent growth by about
 1 cm over multiple prior exams is noted; an additional contour projecting over
 the aortic arch represent a contained dissection/pseudoaneurysm and
 lymphadenopathy as seen on prior CT.  There continues to be a moderate left
 pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary edema lingers. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
