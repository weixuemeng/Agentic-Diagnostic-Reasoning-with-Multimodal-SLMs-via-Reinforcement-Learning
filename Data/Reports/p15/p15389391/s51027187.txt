 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:18 PM
  ET tube 5 cm from the carina.  Right IJ at cavoatrial junction - appears to
  have been advanced compared to prior.  NG within the stomach.  No
  pneumothorax.  Focal consolidative opacities in the right lung appear somewhat
  improved.  Though infection and septic emboli remain in the differential,
  findings could also have been due in some part to asymmetric pulmonary edema
  given the interval mprovement.  Stable mild pulmonary edema, best appreciated
  in the left lung.  Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
  atelectasis.   Enlarged periaortic contour is unchanged.  Cardiac silhouette
  difficult to assess due to basilar opacities. ___ p_________________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:51 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Fluid overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Right IJ line ends at the estimated level of the superior cavoatrial junction.
 Compared to ___, mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has improved, but
 there has been no appreciable change since 1 a.m. on ___, including
 multiple almost nodular opacities in the right lung probably multifocal
 infection, now with a suggestion of cavitation.  Septic emboli should be
 considered as well as pneumonia.  Left lower lobe has been persistently
 airless, either consolidated or collapsed.  Right basal atelectasis has
 worsened.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed, unchanged. 
 Mediastinal widening due to dissection and hematoma is stable.  No
 pneumothorax.
