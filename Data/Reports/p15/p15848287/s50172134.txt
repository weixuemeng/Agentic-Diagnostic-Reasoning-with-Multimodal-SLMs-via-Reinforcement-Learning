                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___M with cough  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Linear opacity at the left lung base is most suggestive of atelectasis,
 especially in setting of relatively low lung volumes.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities.  Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggest
 prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
