                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 New left lower lobe opacity is associated with volume loss, manifested by
 posterior displacement of the left major fissure.  A left pleural effusion has
 increased in size, and is now moderate with a likely subpulmonic component. 
 New poorly-defined somewhat nodular opacities have developed in the right
 upper lobe.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance except for
 slight inferior displacement of the left hilum.  Small right pleural effusion
 has slightly increased in size and is associated with adjacent opacity in the
 right retrocardiac area.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New left lower lobe opacity.  Rapid development and associated volume loss
 favor atelectasis over infectious pneumonia.
 
 2.  New poorly defined opacities in right upper lobe, which could represent
 developing bronchopneumonia or an acute aspiration event.
 
 3.  Moderate left pleural effusion with apparent subpulmonic component.  Small
 right pleural effusion.
