                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post recent sternotomy, with stable postoperative
 alignment of the sternal wires, with no evidence of displaced or disrupted
 wires as compared to baseline postoperative chest x-___ ___ ___. 
 However, note is made of a mid sternal lucency measuring about 3 mm in
 diameter above the most proximal sternal wire.  Stable postoperative widening
 of cardiac silhouette.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis persists in the retrocardiac region as well as small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No visible pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of sternal wire displacement, rotation, or
 disruption.  Mid sternal lucency above the first sternal wire is a nonspecific
 finding that can occasionally be seen normally in the postoperative period. 
 If clinical suspicion for dehiscence persists, consider CT for further
 evaluation, as it is more sensitive than chest radiographs for detecting this
 complication.
