                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever with confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The
 aortic knob is calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  The lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation.  Punctate calcific density projecting over the
 left upper lung field likely reflects a granuloma.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
