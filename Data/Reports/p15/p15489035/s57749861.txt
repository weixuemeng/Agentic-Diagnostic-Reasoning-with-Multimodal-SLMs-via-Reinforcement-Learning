                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with history of breast cancer and lung
 metastases.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change and no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  The strongly apical
 lordotic view accounts for the increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette.
 The lungs are clear and there is no evidence of vascular congestion or pleural
 effusion.
 
 Surgical clips are again seen in the right axillary region.
