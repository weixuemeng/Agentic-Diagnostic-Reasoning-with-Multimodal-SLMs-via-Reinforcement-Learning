                                 FINAL REPORT
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright portable chest view was reviewed.  No prior chest
 radiograph was available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS
 
 Ill-defined opacity in the left mid/lower lungs likely represents
 aspiration/pneumonia.  Followup radiograph is recommended to look for interval
 changes.  Right lung is clear.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  Small left pleural effusion is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Ill-defined opacity in the left mid/lower lung is concerning for
 aspiration/pneumonia.
 2.  Blunting of the left lateral costophrenic angle probably due to small left
 pleural effusion.
