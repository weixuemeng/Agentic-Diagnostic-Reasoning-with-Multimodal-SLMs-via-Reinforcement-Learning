                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension, nausea and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs are available from ___ and a CT
 torso from that same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The aorta is slightly tortuous and
 calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  In addition
 to low lung volumes, there is similar relative mild-to-moderate relative
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the left.  There is mild
 interstitial abnormality suggesting slight fluid overload or pulmonary
 congestion.  Streaky left basilar opacities suggest atelectasis in association
 with a small suspected left-sided pleural effusion.  The bones are
 demineralized.  There are moderate-to-severe degenerative changes depicted
 along the partly visualized left shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
