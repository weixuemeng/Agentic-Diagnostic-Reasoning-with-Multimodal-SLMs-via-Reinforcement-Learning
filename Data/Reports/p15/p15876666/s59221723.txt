 suspicious for atypical enchondroma versus low-grade chondrosarcoma presented
 from home with shortness of breath and altered mental status, found to have
 multifocal pneumonia, now intubated due to respiratory failure.  // interval

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged.  The right basilar opacification appears similar.  Although

 superimposed pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
