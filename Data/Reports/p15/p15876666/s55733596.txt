                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, hypoxia  // ? acute cardiouplm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest ___, chest radiograph ___. 
 Earlier studies are not available for review due to issue with PACS.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are scattered patchy opacities that are better demonstrated on the
 concurrent chest CTA.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  A 11 mm sclerotic focus
 in the left humeral neck is unchanged since at least ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Patchy parenchymal opacities better demonstrated on the concurrent chest
 CTA.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 2. 11 mm left humeral neck sclerotic focus is unchanged since at least ___.  This most likely represents a bone island.  However, if there is any
 clinical concern for sclerotic metastases, comparison to earlier studies would
 be helpful, when made available.
