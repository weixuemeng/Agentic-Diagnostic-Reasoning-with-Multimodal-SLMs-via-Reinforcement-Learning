                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with shortness of breath.  Intubated.  Evaluate endotracheal
 tube position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:10
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study there has been insertion of endotracheal tube which
 projects 4.5 cm from the carina.  The enteric tube terminates in the left
 upper quadrant.  Lung volumes are reduced since the prior study.  There are
 new opacities at the right lung base with elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, which in combination likely suggest volume loss and
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Satisfactory position of endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 New right basilar opacity likely in part due to atelectasis although
 blossoming pneumonia is also suspected.
