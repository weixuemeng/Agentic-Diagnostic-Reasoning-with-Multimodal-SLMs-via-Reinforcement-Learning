 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cerebral palsy and developmental delay,

 No comparison studies at this institution.  Comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 PA and lateral views dated ___ at 18:59 are submitted.  There are some
 overlying motion on the lateral view, which somewhat limits evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Relatively diminished lung volumes with no focal airspace consolidation,
 pleural effusions, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits given patient rotation.  No
 acute bony abnormality.
