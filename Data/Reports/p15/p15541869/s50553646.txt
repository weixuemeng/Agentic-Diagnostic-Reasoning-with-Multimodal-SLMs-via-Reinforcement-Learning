 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Sepsis unknown source, abdominal pain and altered mental
 status.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was provided.  Patient
 is quite rotated to the left which limits the evaluation.  The heart is
 enlarged which could in part reflect leftward rotation.  There is a left
 pleural effusion which is small in size.  There is a small area of
 consolidation in the left upper lobe which could represent a small focus of
 pneumonia.  Mild pulmonary edema is present.  Atherosclerotic calcifications
 at the aortic knob noted.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema, left upper lobe focal consolidation could
 represent pneumonia.  Small left pleural effusion.  Cardiomegaly.
