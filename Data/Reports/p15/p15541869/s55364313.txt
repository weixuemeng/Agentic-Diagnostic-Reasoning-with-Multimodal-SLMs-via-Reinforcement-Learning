 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:09 PM
  Bilateral low lung volumes with accentuation of cardiac silhouette. Again
  noted is a large hiatal hernia with adjacent basilar atelectasis. Left
  costophrenic angle not well visualized, atelectasis vs pleural effusion cant
  be excluded. Minimal opacification at the right medial lung base may represent
  atelectasis, however infectious proces can't be excluded in the correct
  clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 6:40 P.M. ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  Decreased breath sounds and crackles at the right base, evaluate the
 lungs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Generalized interstitial pulmonary abnormality could be mild edema.  Careful
 followup is advised because of the nodular quality of this abnormality which
 makes it imperative to exclude disseminated metastases or granulomatous
 infection.  Low lung volumes exaggerate hilar size, another region that should
 be evaluated with conventional radiographs when feasible.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly and large hiatus hernia are bigger today than they were in ___. 
 Pleural effusions are small if any.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged.
