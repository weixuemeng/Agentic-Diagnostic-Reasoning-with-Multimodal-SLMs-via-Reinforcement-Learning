                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with delirium s/p dobhoff placement  // dobhoff
 placement      dobhoff placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, on the final image the Dobbhoff
 tube is in the mid portion of the body of the stomach, though with the tip
 pointin upward.
 
 Somewhat poor definition of pulmonary markings consistent with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure. More focal area of of coalescent abnormality is
 suggested in the left hilar region. This could reflect asymmetric central
 pulmonary edema, although in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be considered. The left hemidiaphragm is not well
 seen, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe.
