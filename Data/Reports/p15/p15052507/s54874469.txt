                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pneumothorax.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 on ___ at 3:39 p.m.
 
 Right basal pneumothorax appears to be unchanged in the presence of two right
 chest tubes.  The right apical pneumothorax appears to be decreased.  Bibasal
 consolidations, left more than right and left pleural effusion, moderate with
 right mediastinal shift are redemonstrated, unchanged.  No left pneumothorax
 demonstrated.  There is lucency projecting over the left lower lung over the
 area of fluid.  It most likely represents summation of shadows, but cavitation
 within the lung parenchyma cannot be entirely excluded and attention to this
 area on the subsequent studies is recommended.
