  Lung volumes are lower. Again noted is a right pleural effusion with adjacent
  atelectasis which is minimally increased. Left basilar atelectasis is also
  minimally increased but no significant left pleural effusion. Increased
  prominence of the pulmonary vasculature suggestive of mild fluid overload.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right hydropneumothorax, bilateral thoracocentesis, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.
 No convincing evidence for the presence of a left pneumothorax.  The known
 small basal right hydropneumothorax is constant in appearance.  No evidence of
 larger apical pneumothorax component.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with
 slightly lower lung volumes.  No overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.  Known
 atelectasis bilaterally at the lung bases.
