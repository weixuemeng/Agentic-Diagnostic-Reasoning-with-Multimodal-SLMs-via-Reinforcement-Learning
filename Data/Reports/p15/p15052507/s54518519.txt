                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with right sided chest tube and pleurx, s/p
 left thoracentesis today with ? PTX on left (IP requests repeat film to
 determine if chest tube needs to be placed)  // ? PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS ___ THROUGH ___ AT 17:15.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 SEVERE ENLARGEMENT OF THE CARDIAC SILHOUETTE IS STABLE. SMALL RIGHT
 PNEUMOTHORAX WITH APICAL AND BASAL COMPONENTS UNCHANGED, BECAUSE OF THE
 OVERLYING DEVICES I CANNOT TELL WHETHER IN ADDITION TO THE LARGE BORE RIGHT
 THORACOSTOMY TUBE THERE IS A NEW RIGHT BASAL PLEURAL DRAIN. SMALL LEFT PLEURAL
 EFFUSION UNCHANGED. NO LEFT PNEUMOTHORAX. BIBASILAR ATELECTASIS IS
 SUBSTANTIAL, AND IT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXCLUDE CONSOLIDATION IN THE RIGHT
 LOWER LOBE.
