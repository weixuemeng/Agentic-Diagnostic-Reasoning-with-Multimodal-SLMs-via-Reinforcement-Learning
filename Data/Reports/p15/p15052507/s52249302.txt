 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post thoracocentesis bilaterally.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of
 a small known hydropneumothorax on the right.  The extent of the right pleural
 effusion has minimally increased.  On the left, blunting of the costophrenic
 sinus also suggests a small effusion.  Mild retrocardiac and right basal
 atelectasis.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.
