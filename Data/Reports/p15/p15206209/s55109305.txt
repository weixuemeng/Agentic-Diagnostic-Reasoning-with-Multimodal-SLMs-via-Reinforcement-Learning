 evaluation of pleural efussion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the pleural effusion on the
 right appears substantially improved.  However, this could merely represent a
 more upright position of the patient.
 Monitoring and support devices are unchanged.  There is again enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion.
