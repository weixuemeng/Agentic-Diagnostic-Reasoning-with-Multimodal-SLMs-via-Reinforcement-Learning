 TECHNIQUE:  Portable
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided subclavian line has been pulled back with the tip in the low SVC.
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient
 with a dual-channel pacer with leads extending to the right atrium and apex of
 the right ventricle.  No change in the degree of pulmonary edema and the
 bilateral layering pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the
 bases, worse on the right.  The right rib fractures are difficult to see on
 this study, but there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided subclavian line has been pulled back with the tip in the low SVC.
