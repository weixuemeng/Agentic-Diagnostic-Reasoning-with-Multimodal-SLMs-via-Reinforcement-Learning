                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath and fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient rotation.  Left-sided pacemaker device with
 leads terminating in the regions of the right atrium right ventricle appear
 grossly unchanged.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  Low lung volumes persist
 with crowding of bronchovascular structures and probable mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Linear and patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may
 reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged.  S-shaped scoliosis of
 the thoracolumbar spine with multilevel degenerative changes are again noted. 
 Compression deformity of the T7 vertebral body appears grossly unchanged. 
 Partially imaged is cervical spinal fusion hardware.  Remote right-sided rib
 fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to rotation and low lung volumes.  Bibasilar atelectasis
 with probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
