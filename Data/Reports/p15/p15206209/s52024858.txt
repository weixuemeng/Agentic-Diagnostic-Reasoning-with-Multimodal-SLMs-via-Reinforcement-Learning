                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p mechanical fall w/ R rib fx, T7 compression fx, C5
 spinous fx, R orbital wall fx, acute splenic infarct, scalp lac, HD4 POD2
 cervical laminectomy C4-T1.  // ICU
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are at least 2 right-sided rib fracture seen.  No pneumothorax.  No
 left-sided rib fracture seen.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion but
 no overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged compared
 to the prior study.  Small hiatus hernia.  Left lower lobe atelectasis. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects a small pleural
 effusion versus pleural scarring.  Compression fracture in the mid thoracic
 spine.  Moderately severe S-shaped scoliotic curve convex to the left centered
 at L3
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Otherwise, no significant interval
 change.
