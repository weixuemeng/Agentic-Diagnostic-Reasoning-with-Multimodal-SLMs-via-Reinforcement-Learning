                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cardiac arrest.  CPR performed.  Evaluation of tube positions.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph to demonstrate the ET tube terminating
 approximately 5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip and sidehole are below
 the diaphragm.  There is a moderate pneumothorax evidenced in the right
 costophrenic sulcus.  In addition, subcutaneous air is seen along the right
 hemithorax.
 
 Right lateral rib fracture is seen.  Pulmonary consolidations involve the
 entire right lung and are likely due to pulmonary edema, likely represent
 asymmetric edema, underlying infection not excluded.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged, though evaluation is limited on this projection due to other
 findings.
 
 Findings were discussed by phone by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ at
 3:30 p.m. on ___.
