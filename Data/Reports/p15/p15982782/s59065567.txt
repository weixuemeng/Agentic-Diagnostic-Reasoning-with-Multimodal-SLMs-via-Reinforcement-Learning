                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with metastatic prostate
 cancer.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Substantial left pleural effusion is unchanged as well as smaller
 right pleural effusion associated with bibasal atelectasis and mild vascular
 congestion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, no substantial change since
 the prior study demonstrated.
