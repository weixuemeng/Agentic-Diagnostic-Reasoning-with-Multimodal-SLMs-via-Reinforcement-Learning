                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is airspace
 consolidation in the right middle lobe compatible with pneumonia.  There is an
 associated small right pleural effusion.  There is mild loss of definition of
 the left heart border with subtle adjacent opacity which could indicate a
 small component of pneumonia within the lingula.  Otherwise the lungs are
 clear.  No pneumothorax.  No signs of pulmonary edema.  Heart size appears
 grossly stable.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Bony structures are
 intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right middle lobe and lingular consolidations compatible with pneumonia. 
 Associated small right pleural effusion.
