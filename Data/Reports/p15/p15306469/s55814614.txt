                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness  // PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration.  There is increased
 retrocardiac density, though no apparent effacement of the diaphragm.  The
 possibility of left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation cannot be
 entirely excluded.  Curvilinear density overlying the left are border raises
 the question of an effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 Increased retrocardiac density uncertain significance -- question compressive
 atelectasis, but the possibility of a pleural effusion and/or left lower lobe
 consolidation cannot be excluded. .  If clinically indicated, conventional PA
 and lateral views  when the patient is able could help to further assess the
 left lower lobe.
