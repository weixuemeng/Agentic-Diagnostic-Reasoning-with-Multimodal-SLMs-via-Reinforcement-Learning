                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but similar.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  Streaky opacities within the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angle posteriorly on the
 right may suggest the presence of a small right pleural effusion.  Multiple
 clips are again noted within the right aspect of the anterior mediastinum with
 prior mitral valve repair.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis, with probable trace right
 pleural effusion.
