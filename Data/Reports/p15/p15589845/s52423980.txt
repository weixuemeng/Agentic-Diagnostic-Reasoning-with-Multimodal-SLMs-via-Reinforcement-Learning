                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with amnesia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral view of the chest provided demonstrate no focal consolidation,
 effusion or pneumothorax. Lungs are hyperinflated. There is a nodular opacity
 projecting over the mid thoracic spine on the lateral view. Prominent fat pad
 adjacent to the right heart border likely accounts for partial silhouetting
 noted. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of pneumonia.
 2. Nodular opacity on the lateral view requires further evaluation with
 nonemergent CT of the chest.
