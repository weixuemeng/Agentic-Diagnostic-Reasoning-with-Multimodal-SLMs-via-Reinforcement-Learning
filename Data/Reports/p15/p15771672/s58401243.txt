                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with ___, Alzheimer, prednisone, question of
 aspiration, leukocytosis, pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Interstitial edema has worsened and there is now moderate-to-severe alveolar
 preliminary edema.  There is a more focal zone in right mid lung that could be
 edema, aspiration or pneumonia.  Right lower lung consolidation is obscured by
 the pulmonary edema.  Mild cardiac enlargement and left pectoral
 atrioventricular pacemaker is unchanged.  Small pleural effusion if any. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Moderate-to-severe alveolar pulmonary edema has worsened.
 2.  There is a new focal consolidation in right middle lobe that could be
 related only to pulmonary edema, but new aspiration pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  The new right lower lobe consolidation that has worsened yesterday
 is partly obscured by pulmonary edema.
 
 Dr. ___ has been verbally contacted for the results.
