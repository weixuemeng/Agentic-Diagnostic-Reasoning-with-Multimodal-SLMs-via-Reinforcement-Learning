                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  Rotated positioning.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 5:09 a.m., the overall appearance is similar.  There
 may have been slight interval clearing at the right lung apex.  Otherwise, I
 doubt significant interval change.  Dual-lead pacemaker again noted.  No gross
 effusion.
