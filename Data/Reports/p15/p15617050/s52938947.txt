                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post cervical mediastinoscopy for right upper lobe lung
 nodule.  Evaluate post-operatively.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  PET-CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right apical opacity is not significantly changed from prior
 exam, and most consistent with the known right apical lung nodule.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  A small amount of pneumomediastinum is present,
 which is not unexpected post-operatively.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 otherwise normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small amount of pneumomediastinum, which is not unexpected
 post-operatively.
 2.  Stable appearance of the right upper lobe nodule, better evaluated on the
 recent PET-CT.
