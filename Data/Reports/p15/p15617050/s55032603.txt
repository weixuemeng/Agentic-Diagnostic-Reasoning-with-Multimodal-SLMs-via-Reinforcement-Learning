                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known lung nodule.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PET CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the retrocardiac area, there is increased opacification, which
 may be due to a slight increase in size of the vessels or atelectasis, though
 in the proper clinical setting, a pneumonia cannot be completely excluded.  At
 the right apex, the known pulmonary nodule is difficult to visualize, though a
 vague opacity is present. The lungs are otherwise clear without new nodules. 
 There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Minimal
 apical scarring is present.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased retrocardiac opacification could be due to vessels or
 atelectasis, though in the proper clinical setting, an early pneumonia cannot
 be completely excluded.
 2.  Right apical pulmonary nodule is difficult to visualize, and better
 characterized on the recent PET-CT.
