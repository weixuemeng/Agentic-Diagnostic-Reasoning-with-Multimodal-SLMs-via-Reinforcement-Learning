                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after right upper lobectomy
 due to lung cancer and now new right supraclavicular mass.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  The appearance of mediastinum is stable with resolution
 of the fluid collection in the right upper lung and stable post-surgical
 appearance of the right upper and lower lung fields.  No definitive mass is
 demonstrated in the supraclavicular area, but this study is not optimal for
 evaluation of supraclavicular lymphadenopathy/masses and correlation with CT
 neck or chest CT is recommended.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
