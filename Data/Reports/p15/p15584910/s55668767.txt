                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Near syncope and malaise.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  The heart is normal in
 size.  There is moderate tortuosity of the aorta as well as calcification
 along the arch.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Mild
 relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is stable.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Patchy left basilar opacities, probably in
 the left lower lobe appear similar and suggest minor atelectasis or scarring
 with no definite superimposed process.  The bones appear probably
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Similar patchy left basilar
 opacity suggestive of atelectasis.
