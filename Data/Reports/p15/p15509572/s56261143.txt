                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with history of Hodgkin's disease and mantle
 radiation with three-month history of left mid back pain.
 
 The cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the left as before.  Cardiac size
 cannot be evaluated.  Radiation fibrosis in the left lung is again noted
 associated with pleural thickening.  The right lung is clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax or effusions.  There is unchanged elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 This examination is not tailored to evaluate the osseous structures, no
 definitive displaced rib fracture is noted.  If clinically persistent
 suspicion, dedicated rib series should be performed.
