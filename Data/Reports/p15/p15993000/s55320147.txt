 unchanged with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  There is
 diffuse calcification of the aorta.  The pulmonary vascularity is not
 engorged.  Streaky opacity in the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis.

 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
