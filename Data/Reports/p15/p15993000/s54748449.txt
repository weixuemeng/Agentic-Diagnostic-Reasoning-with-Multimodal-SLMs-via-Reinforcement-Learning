                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Slurred speech, headache.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous and
 demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications at the arch.  Streaky bibasilar
 airspace opacities most likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is due to
 low lung volumes, with no pulmonary edema identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with streaky bibasilar airspace opacities most likely
 reflecting atelectasis.  Infection cannot be completely excluded.
