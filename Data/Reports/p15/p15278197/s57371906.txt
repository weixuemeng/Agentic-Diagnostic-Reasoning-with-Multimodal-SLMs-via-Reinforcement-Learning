                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with avr  // r/o ptx, s/p ct d/c
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a small residual pneumomediastinum, decreased compared to the prior
 study.  Widening of the mediastinum is similar in degree.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular engorgement persists with linear atelectasis in the right lung base,
 at the site of the prior chest drain.  The chest tubes have been removed.  The
 Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed, a large poor right internal jugular
 catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  There is a focal airspace opacity
 adjacent to the left heart border which likely reflects atelectasis but
 infection cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax seen.  Linear atelectasis at the right lung base. An opacity
 adjacent the left heart border likely reflects atelectasis, infection cannot
 be excluded.
