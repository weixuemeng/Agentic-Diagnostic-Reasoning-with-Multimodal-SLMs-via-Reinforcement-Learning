                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aortic stenosis and mesenteric ischemia, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  There is increased opacification at the right base,
 consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 Continued opacification at the right base consistent with volume loss and
 pleural effusion.
 
 In the abdomen, there is a relative paucity of bowel gas.  No gross evidence
 of intramural gas is appreciated on this limited study of the area.
