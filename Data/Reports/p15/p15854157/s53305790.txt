                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with aortic stenosis, status post aortic colectomy for
 mesenteric ischemia.  Evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph dated ___ timed at 5:01 a.m.,
 it was obtained and compared to ___ timed at 5:39 a.m.
 
 REPORT:
 
 Allowing for projection, there may be mild cardiomegaly.  Calcification of the
 aortic arch is seen.  A right-sided internal jugular line and patient's NG
 tubes appear in unchanged position.
 
 There are bilateral effusions, worse when compared to the previous day, worse
 on the left side where complete associated opacification of the left
 hemithorax suggests significant atelectasis.   There is degenerative change of
 the thoracic spine.  Heavy vascular calcification of the splenic artery is
 seen.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 Worsening pleural effusions when compared to previous day.
 
 Ongoing collapse in the left lower lobe.
