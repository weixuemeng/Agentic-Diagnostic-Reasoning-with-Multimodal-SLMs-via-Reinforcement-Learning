                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath and leg swelling,
 question pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph is provided.  This study is
 limited but demonstrates no large confluent consolidation, pleural effusions
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to evaluate
 due to poor inspiratory effort.  An IVC filter is in place.  The patient has
 had multiple vertebroplasties.  Bony structures are otherwise intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam, but no large consolidation.  Suggest repeat
 two-view chest radiograph when the patient is amenable.
