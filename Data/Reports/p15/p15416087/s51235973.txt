 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:58 PM
  1. Improved aeration of the right lung after stent placement.  The stent is
  not definitely visualized, though may be obscured by osseous hardware.  No
  evidence of pneumothorax.   2. Patchy right lung opacities are similar to the
  prior exam.  These may be infectious or rexpansion edema.  Persistent pleural
  thickening and possible small right pleural effusion.  3.  Unchanged
  hyperexpanded clear left lung.  4. Unchanged cardiomediastinal silhouette,
  still deviated rightward.  5. Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position at
  the level fo the clavicles.  -___ discussed with Dr. ___ at 9 PM on
  ___ via telephone by Dr. ___ at the time the findings were discovered.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with renal cell cancer and new bronchus intermedius
 stent placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 11:29 a.m.
 
 Portable AP chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet.  Spinal hardware
 overlies the upper thoracic vertebrae obscuring some detail.  There appears to
 be improving aeration in the right lung, though the bronchial stent cannot be
 definitively identified, possibly being obscured by the spinal hardware. 
 There continues to be a diffuse abnormality within the right lung and
 involving the right pleura consistent with known metastatic disease.  Left
 lung remains hyperinflated without focal airspace consolidation.  A 1.5 cm
 nodular opacity in the left lower lung is stable and remains suspicious for a
 pulmonary metastasis.  The other lung nodules which are visualized on the CT
 study of ___ are not readily appreciable on the plain film study. 
 Assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult due to
 rightward deviation related to the right-sided volume loss.  The left
 costophrenic angle is not entirely included on the study.  No large left-sided
 effusion is appreciated.  No pneumothorax.
