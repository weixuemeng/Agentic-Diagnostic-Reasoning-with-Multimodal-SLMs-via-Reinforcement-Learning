                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 343 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with lung mets status post rigid bronch for
 removal of tumor ingrowth into the bronchus, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP chest film ___ at 343 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Spinal hardware overlies the upper thoracic vertebrae.  An endotracheal tube
 is seen, unchanged in position with the tip at the thoracic inlet.  There
 continues to be improving aeration in the right lung but with persistent
 pleural thickening and patchy opacities throughout the right lung which may
 reflect metastatic disease, superimposed infectious process or re-expansion
 pulmonary edema.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Left lung is without
 evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.
 There is a stable 1.5 cm nodular opacity in the left lower lung, which is
 suspicious for pulmonary metastasis, especially when correlated with a CT
 dated ___.  No pneumothorax is seen.
