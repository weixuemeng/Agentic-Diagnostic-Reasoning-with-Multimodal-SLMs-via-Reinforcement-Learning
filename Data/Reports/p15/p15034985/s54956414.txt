 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lateral and apical component of the small left pneumothorax are no larger. 
 The medial component has less fluid, following removal of the left pleural
 drain.  Lung volumes are low and atelectasis probably counts for opacification
 at the base the right lung.  Small right pleural effusion is stable.  Heart
 size is normal.  Moderate gaseous distention of the stomach is still present.
