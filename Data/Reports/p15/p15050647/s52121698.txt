 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:20 PM
   Decreased size of now small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.  No
  pneumothorax.  Minmal right basilar atelectasis is decreased; concomitant
  infection or sequelae of aspiration at the right lung base cannot be excluded.
   Widening of the paraspinal line bilaterally may be projectional, recommended
  further evaluation with PA and lateral radiographs when patient can tolerate.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess for pneumothorax after thoracentesis, patient with
 hypotension and AFib.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There has been interval decrease in size in now small right pleural effusion. 
 There is no evident pneumothorax.  Aeration of the left lower lobe has
 improved.  Residual opacity in the right lower lobe is a combination of
 atelectasis and pleural effusion.  Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with cardiomegaly.  The aorta is
 tortuous.
