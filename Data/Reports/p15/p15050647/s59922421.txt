                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male found down.  Evaluation for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is increased opacity in the right lung
 base, likely a combination of moderate pleural effusion and associated
 consolidation.  Findings may reflect atelectasis though aspiration or
 pneumonia are also within the differential given the clinical history.  The
 remainder of the lungs appear clear.  There is no vascular congestion or overt
 edema.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Evaluation
 of the cardiac size is limited due to basilar opacity.  No pneumothorax is
 evident.  Degenerative changes of the bilateral shoulder joints are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lung base opacity, likely a combination of effusion and
 consolidation.  Aspiration or pneumonia are within the differential.
