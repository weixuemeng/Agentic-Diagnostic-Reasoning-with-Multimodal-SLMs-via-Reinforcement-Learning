 INDICATION:  The hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Widespread reticular opacities reflect chronic interstitial disease, better
 appreciated on the CT examination from ___. There are also
 superimposed widespread opacities, suspicious for edema, blood, or atypical
 infection.  There is focally increased opacity against the right upper
 mediastinum, which could represent more focal consolidation or new
 lymphadenopathy.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widespread pulmonary opacities superimposed on the background of known
 pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, concerning for atypical infection, edema, or
 hemorrhage.
 Increased right paramediastinal opacity, representing more focal consolidation
 or lymphadenopathy.
