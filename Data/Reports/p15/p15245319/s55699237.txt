                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fevers and substernal chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest geographic is compared to radiograph dated ___. Relative to prior examination, prior central bronchovascular and diffuse
 interstitial prominence is less conspicuous compatible with improved pulmonary
 edema. Likely mild heart failure persists. A small right pleural effusion and
 likely left pleural effusion is present. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
 appears to have been present on radiograph dated ___. Though this
 may reflect eventration of the hemidiaphragm, somewhat lateral displacement
 raises suspicion of a sub pulmonic effusion. Hilar and mediastinal contours
 are stable in appearance. Tortuous descending aorta is stable. No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Relative to prior study dated ___, pulmonary edema is improved on
 a background of interstitial lung disease.
 
 Right pleural effusion and likely small left pleural effusion. Elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm may reflect diaphragmatic eventration though question
 subpulmonic effusion.
