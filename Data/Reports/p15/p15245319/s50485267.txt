 INDICATION:  Acute on chronic hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:

 parenchymal fibrosis.  However, there are superimposed widespread opacities,
 likely reflecting pulmonary edema or new consolidations, worse on the right. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New pulmonary edema or consolidations superimposed on a background of
 parenchymal fibrosis, slightly worse on the right.
