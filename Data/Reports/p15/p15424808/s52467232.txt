 moderately enlarged, unchanged from the prior exam.  The mediastinal contours
 are normal.  Surgical clips project over the upper mediastinum, also unchanged
 from the prior exam.

 1.  Stable left upper lobe mass.
 2.  No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 3.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
