                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph. ___ Chest CT.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is markedly
 calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Left upper lobe lesion containing a fiducial
 marker is again demonstrated, not significantly changed from prior study. 
 Multiple other clips are seen scattered about the upper back.  Small right
 pleural effusion is likely present with adjacent opacity in the right lung
 base, likely reflecting atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild
 emphysematous changes are again seen.  Deformity of the right proximal humerus
 likely reflects a remote fracture.  Compression deformity of a mid thoracic
 vertebral body is unchanged compared to the prior chest CT from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion with probable adjacent atelectasis. 
 Unchanged left upper lobe lesion.
