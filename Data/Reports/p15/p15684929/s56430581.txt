                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with intibation, OG tube placement.  // ett, og
 tube
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present --___ tip lies approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. An
 OG type tube is present, tip extends beneath the diaphragm into the abdomen
 and overlies the stomach.
 
 There is slightly rotated positioning. Allowing for this, the cardiac
 silhouette is markedly abnormal and it is difficult to completely characterize
 the visualized contours. There is probable cardiomegaly. There is splaying of
 the carina consistent with left atrial enlargement. The aortic arch is top
 normal in size, measuring up to 3.9 cm. The possibility of more dilated areas
 in the adjoining descending aorta cannot be excluded. The hila are not well
 delineated and could very well be enlarged. No apical capping  is identified.
 
 In addition, there is diffuse vascular plethora and alveolar opacity. There
 are probable layering effusions on both sides with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET an OG tube in satisfactory position.
 2. Markedly abnormal and enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette. The
 possibility of aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta cannot be excluded.
 3. Vascular plethora and diffuse alveolar opacities. This is compatible with
 pulmonary edema, but other causes of alveolar opacities cannot be excluded.
 4. Bilateral effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
