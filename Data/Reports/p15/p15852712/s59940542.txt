  Very low lung volumes, which is the likely explanation for new bibasilar
  opacities consistent with atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
  retrocardiac opacity could represent infection.  Abdominal drain terminates in
  the left upper quadrant.  Nasoenteric tube terminates below the diaphragm.
  Coiled radiopaque line overlies the right hemithorax. - ___ p_________________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with a history of gastric cancer, now status post
 total gastrectomy, in need of post-operative interval change.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Pre-operative chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, which exaggerates the heart size as well
 as AP projection which also exaggerates the heart size.  Retrocardiac
 atelectasis is present.  Pulmonary vasculature is prominent.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Subdiaphragmatic drains are present as is
 an endo-intestinal tube with its side port below the diaphragmatic hiatus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and retrocardiac atelectasis; pulmonary vascular
 congestion likely from recent surgery/IV fluids.
