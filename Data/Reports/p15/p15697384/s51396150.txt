                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___:
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post fall.  Evaluate for rib
 fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  Study is very limited due to the overlying hardware across the
 chest.  The heart size is enlarged.  There is left retrocardiac opacity and an
 area of increased density at the right base, suggestive of atelectasis or
 developing infiltrate.  The known rib fractures seen on the prior CT scan is
 not well appreciated due to the overlying hardware.  No pneumothoraces are
 present.
