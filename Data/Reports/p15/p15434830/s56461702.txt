 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  HCV, pre-treatment evaluation.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Nodular opacities projecting in the
 lower hemithorax bilaterally are likely the nipple shadows.  Shallow obliques
 with nipple markers are recommended to confirm this finding.  There is no
 pneumothorax, pneumonia, CHF, or pleural effusion.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  Hardware in the spine is partially visualized.
