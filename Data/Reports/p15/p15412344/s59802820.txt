                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post redo of sternotomy and aortic valve repair.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable view of the chest demonstrates increased vascular congestion and
 pulmonary edema consistent with worsening fluid overload.  The heart is
 enlarged, possibly slightly more so than on ___.  There is increased
 opacification at the left lung base with a more coalescent appearance raising
 the possibility of a developing consolidation.  Right ventricular pacer wire
 is unchanged in position.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Increased vascular congestion and pulmonary edema.  
 
 2. Suggestion of coalescence of an opacity at the left lung base more so on
 the right, raises the possibility of a developing consolidation in this
 region.
