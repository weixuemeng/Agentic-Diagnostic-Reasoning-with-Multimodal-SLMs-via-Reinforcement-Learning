                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with a Port-A-Cath which has not been flushed
 for months.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath seen, appropriately positioned,
 coursing through the left subclavian and terminating within the mid SVC. 
 There is no kinking, evidence of breakage or radiopacities within the
 catheter.  There is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggestive
 of a small pleural effusion.  The aorta is tortuous and minimally calcified. 
 Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  The
 pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided Port-A-Cath appropriately positioned with no
 radiographic evidence of failure.
