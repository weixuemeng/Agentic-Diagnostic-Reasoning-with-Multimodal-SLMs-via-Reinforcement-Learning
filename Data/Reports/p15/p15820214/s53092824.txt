                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hyperextension of the neck and fall on to face.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, and particularly in that context,
 probably streaky opacities are most suggestive of atelectasis at the lung
 bases.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in
 size.  No fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of injury.
