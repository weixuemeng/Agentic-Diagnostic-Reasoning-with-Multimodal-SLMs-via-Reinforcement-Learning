 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SOB  // eval for PNA or pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular engorgement are chronic.  Focal
 opacification at the lung bases could be combination of atelectasis and early
 edema, but cannot be distinguished from aspiration or even early pneumonia.
 Small right pleural effusion is stable. Enlargement of head neck vessels and
 the right lobe of the thyroid gland explain deviation of the trachea in the
 lower neck and upper mediastinum. No pneumothorax.
