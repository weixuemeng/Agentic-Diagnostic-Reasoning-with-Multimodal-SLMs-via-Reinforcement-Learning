                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia and left leg swelling and pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  CT abdomen pelvis from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 2 AP portable views of the chest.  Better inspiratory effort is obtained on 1
 of the 2 views.  Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are noted.  The left
 costophrenic angle is not clearly identified, potentially due to atelectasis
 versus effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.  More dense
 retrocardiac opacity is identified and could be compatible with patient's
 known hiatal hernia.  Trachea is deviated to the left at the thoracic inlet as
 seen on prior potentially due to tortuosity of the vessels versus thyroid
 enlargement. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion. Left costophrenic angle obscured, potentially
 by atelectasis however effusion is also possible.
