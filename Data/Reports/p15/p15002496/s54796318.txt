                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with epigastric pain.  Evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a moderate right-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis
 at the right lung base, increased opacity within the right lower lung.  Likely
 reflects right lower lobe consolidation versus atelectasis, this best
 appreciated on the lateral view.  The heart is top-normal in size given the AP
 technique.  There is mild interstitial edema, left greater than right.  No
 pneumothorax is seen, and aortic arch calcifications are noted.  Compression
 deformities and degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small-moderate right pleural effusion with mild interstitial edema.  Increased
 opacity at the right lung base likely reflects right basilar atelectasis
 however superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
