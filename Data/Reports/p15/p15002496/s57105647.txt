                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued moderate
 right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis at the base.  The nodular
 lesion in the right hilar region is not definitely appreciated at this time,
 though with change in obliquity, it may be over a rib margin.  The left lung
 is essentially clear.
