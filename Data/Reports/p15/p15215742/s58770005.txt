                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  History of lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISONS:  A scout view from PET-CT dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is persistent patchy opacity projecting along the right suprahilar
 region with volume loss, probably compatible with treatment effect, aside from
 slightly diminished peripheral streaky opacification, but no other definite
 change.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right suprahilar opacification with volume loss,
 suggesting treatment-related change, although this study does not provide a
 detailed assessment of oncological status.  No definite acute disease.
