                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, hemoptysis  // any infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CT dating back to ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is still re-
 demonstration of the right upper lobe collapse which currently appears to be
 widened as compared to previous study that might reflect accumulation of
 secretions within the bronchiectasis of the right upper lobe. No new
 consolidation or mass is demonstrated. The reason for hemoptysis could
 potentially be related to the is old known right upper lobe atelectasis and
 bronchiectasis.
 
 There is new wall small right pleural effusion, reason unclear. Lungs are
 otherwise clear. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Correlation with new chest
 CT might be beneficial to exclude the possibility of pneumo unrelated
 abnormality which is radiographically occult
