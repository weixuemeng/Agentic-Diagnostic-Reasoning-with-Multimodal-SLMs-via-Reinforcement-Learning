                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with collapsed lung, increasing cough.  // Any
 changes in pleural effusion since last month?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral images of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___,
 and ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded. The area of chronic right upper lobe
 bronchiectatic change is again noted, similar prior exam. There has been
 interval increase in the right pleural effusion from prior exam.  No new mass
 or consolidation is seen. There is no left effusion or pneumothorax The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval increase in right pleural effusion.
 
 2. Stable right upper lobe area of bronchiectatic change.  Given the
 increasing pleural effusion and bronchiectatic change, this raises a question
 of a possible underlying malignancy.  Chest CT is indicated for further
 evaluation for malignancy.
