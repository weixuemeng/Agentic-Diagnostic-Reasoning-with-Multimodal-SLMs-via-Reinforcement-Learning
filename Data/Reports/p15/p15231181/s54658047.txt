                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia and increased oxygen requirements.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The lung volumes are low, which does result in crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  Streaky opacity seen at the left lung base is
 unchanged, likely representing scarring.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 Air-filled, nondilated loops of bowel are seen in the abdomen. 
 Cholecystectomy clips are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes without an acute cardiopulmonary process.
