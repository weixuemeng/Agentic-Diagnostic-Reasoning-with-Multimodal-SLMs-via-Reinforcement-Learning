 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, cough, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, the lungs show minimally
 improved ventilation.  As a consequence, some of the pre-existing basal areas
 of atelectasis have resolved.  However, atelectasis is still present at the
 lung bases and the lung volumes remain overall low.  On the lateral
 radiograph, there is minimal posterior blunting of the costophrenic sinuses,
 potentially suggesting the presence of small pleural effusions.  No pulmonary
 edema.  No pneumothorax.
