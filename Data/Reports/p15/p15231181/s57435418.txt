                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status and seizures status post intubation, here
 to evaluate ET tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating at the
 origin of the right main stem bronchus.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm with the side hole in the distal esophagus.  The
 inspiratory lung volumes are low.  Linear opacity in the left lower lung zone
 likely reflects plate-like atelectasis.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  No focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube with tip in origin of right main stem bronchus. 
 Recommend retracting.
 2.  Nasogastric tube with side hole in the distal esophagus.  Recommend
 advancing.
