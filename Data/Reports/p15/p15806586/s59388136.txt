                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left upper quadrant abdominal pain.  Evaluate for infiltrate or
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  A 4-mm
 ovoid opacity projecting over the posterior aspect of the right fourth rib
 could be a small bone island, pulmonary nodule, or focus of pleural
 thickening.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There is minimal pleural thickening at both
 apices.  No pleural effusions are seen.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  4 mm nodular opacity projecting over the anterior fourth right rib. 
 Further evaluation with shallow oblique views could be performed.
