                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aspiration PNA  // assess PNA      assess
 PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much lower
 inspiration.  This and the supine portable positioning most likely accounts
 for the difference in the appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. 
 Again there are small bilateral pleural effusions with underlying compressive
 atelectasis.  Given the clinical history, this could also well reflect
 aspiration or infectious pneumonia.
