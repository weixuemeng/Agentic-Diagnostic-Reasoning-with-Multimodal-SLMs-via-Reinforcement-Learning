                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung volumes without
 pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.  A 3 mm nodular opacity projects over the left mid lung zone. 
 Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  A 3 mm nodular opacity projecting over left mid lung zone of indeterminate
 chronicity due to lack of prior exams.  If prior exams cannot be obtained for
 comparison, a chest CT may be obtained for further assessment or
 alternatively, this lesion may be followed with conventional chest radiographs
 in six months.
