 sternotomy for recent aortic repair. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are unchanged. There continues to be stable patchy retrocardiac opacity with
 probable associated small effusion consistent with lower lobe atelectasis,
 although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Interval decrease in the
 pneumopericardium.  Right lung remains grossly clear.  No pneumothorax,
 although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine
 technique.
