                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right-sided pleuritic chest pain, evaluation for rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  No bony abnormalities, in particular
 no evidence for right-sided rib fractures.  However, if the clinical suspicion
 for a rib fracture persists, dedicated rib series should be acquired.
 
 Mild rightward scoliosis.  Normal structure and transparency of the lung
 parenchyma, normal size and shape of the cardiac silhouette, normal hilar and
 mediastinal structures.  There is no suggestion for acute or chronic
 parenchymal abnormalities in the thorax.
