                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with emesis, maroon positive,  // please eval for
 obstruction and ng tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 14:44
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube with the tip not
 visualized beyond the upper esophagus on the frontal view. While the lateral
 view demonstrates a catheter which courses in the expected region of the
 esophagus and into the upper abdomen, this cannot be confirmed on the frontal
 view. The heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. Streaky atelectasis is noted in
 the lung bases. Compression fracture of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar
 junction is noted, of indeterminate age.  No subdiaphragmatic free air is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube tip can only be traced to the proximal esophagus on the
 frontal view. Recommend advancement.
