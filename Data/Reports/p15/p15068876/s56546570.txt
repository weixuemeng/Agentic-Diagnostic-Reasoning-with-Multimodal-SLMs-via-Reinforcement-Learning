                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible drug reaction, extensive abdominal history.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray examination from ___.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, slightly lower than on the prior exam.  The
 PIC line is no longer visible.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Hazy opacity at
 the right base is unchanged and may reflect some atelectasis in the right
 middle lobe. Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle is unchanged and
 is consistent with a small effusion.   The left lung is grossly clear without
 focal infiltrate or effusion.  No CHF.  Heart is probably slightly enlarged,
 with a left ventricular configuration, but unchanged.
 
 Incidental note is made of multiple drains/stents in the right upper quadrant,
 not fully evaluated on this exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Small right effusion and right base opacity are unchanged compared with
 ___.  No CHF or new opacity identified.  Interval removal of PIC line
 noted.  
 
 2) Targeted review of a ___ radiograph suggests that the right base
 opacity represents a combination of atelectasis and a fat pad.  It may also in
 part be accounted for by the patient's breast implant.
