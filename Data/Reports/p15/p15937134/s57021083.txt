                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Acute renal failure.  History of cirrhosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The lung volumes
 are low.  There are small suspected bilateral pleural effusions, possibly
 increased, particularly on the right.  Persistent perihilar opacities are more
 prominent on the left than right, similar to prior findings, but have
 continued to improve substantially.  Streaky right posterior basilar opacities
 may be due to atelectasis associated with a subpulmonic effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continued improvement in pulmonary opacities. Small pleural effusions.
