                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man admitted for respiratory failure, extubated on
 ___, now with worsening O2 requirement  // eval for worsening pna, edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The evenly distributed pulmonary opacification which improved in the right
 lung during the day on ___ was probably pulmonary edema. The
 left-sided component did not improved.  I presume much of that is pneumonia.
 Today there is greater opacification in the right lung than there was on
 ___:54. Whether this is more pneumonia or recurrent edema is
 radiographically indeterminate, but the heart is slightly larger and
 mediastinal veins are more distended so there is at least a component of new
 or recurrent edema.
 
 Pleural effusions are presumed, particularly in the left chest, but not very
 large.  Right internal jugular line ends in the upper right atrium.
 Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. The upper trachea
 is obscured, but I do not believe an endotracheal tube is in place.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
