 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ___  // placement      placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at 22:39
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ 08:43 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The ___ tube is again seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified but the balloon remaining inflated at the level of the
 gastroesophageal junction.  The endotracheal tube and right internal jugular
 central lines are unchanged in position. There continues to be small to
 moderate layering effusions, right greater than left, but overall the mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema has improved. Patchy opacities at the lung bases
 most likely reflect compressive atelectasis. Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable. No pneumothorax.
