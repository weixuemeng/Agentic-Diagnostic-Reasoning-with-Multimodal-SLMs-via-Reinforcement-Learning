                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with GI bleed, s/p transfusions and fluid
 resuscitation.  // Evaluate for edema      Evaluate for edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 08:42
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable chest film ___ at 15 31 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Two right internal jugular catheters are remain unchanged position. The
 endotracheal tube is unchanged having its tip at thoracic inlet. There are
 layering bilateral effusions with increasing perihilar fullness and indistinct
 pulmonary vasculature consistent with worsening mild to moderate pulmonary
 edema.  There is also increasing bibasilar consolidation likely representing
 partial lower lobe atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable
 given differences in patient rotation between studies.
