                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Variceal bleed status post TIPS, ___, question interval
 change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON: CXR from ___ at 8:01 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS
 
 An ET tube is present, tip 2.7 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present,
 tip extending beneath the diaphragm, off the film.  A right IJ central line is
 present, tip over upper right atrium. 
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There are dense infiltrates in both lungs, more
 extensive on the left.  There is relative sparing of the outer periphery and
 base of the right lung, with predominantly perihilar distribution on the
 right.  Compared with ___ , there has been   possible slight improvement
 in the right upper lobe, adjacent to the minor fissure.   The left
 hemidiaphragm is less well seen on today's exam, ? due to increased lower lobe
 consolidation versus a small left effusion.  No right-sided effusion is
 identified.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive bilateral infiltrates, slightly worse at the left base
 and possibly slightly improved in the right upper zone. The differential
 diagnosis includes both pulmonary edema and infectious infiltrates.
