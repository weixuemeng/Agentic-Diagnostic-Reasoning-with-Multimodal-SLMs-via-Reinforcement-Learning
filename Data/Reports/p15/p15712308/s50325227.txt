                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Neck and left chest wall pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___. 
 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is similar
 mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  A streaky opacity
 persists at the left lung base, but partly resolved.  Otherwise, the lungs
 appear clear.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Very
 small trace pleural effusions are difficult to completely exclude, however. 
 Multifocal compression deformities of the thoracic spine are very similar to
 prior thoracic spine radiographs and are likely attributable to substantial
 bony demineralization.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease or injury.  Stable
 compression deformities.  Bony demineralization.
