                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dry cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart size is
 top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There are low lung
 volumes. There is slight blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles, which
 may represent small pleural effusions. Streaky opacities, more at the left
 lung base than the right, were present on the prior study and likely represent
 atelectasis but underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. Multiple compression
 deformities of thoracic spine are again seen, stable compared to the prior
 study.
 
 IMPRESSION: Slight blunting of both costophrenic angles with stable streaky
 opacities at the lung bases consistent with atelectasis. Underlying pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.
