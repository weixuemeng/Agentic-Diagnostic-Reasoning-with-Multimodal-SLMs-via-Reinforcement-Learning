                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-erect portable radiograph of chest was compared with
 prior chest radiograph of ___.  A chest CT ___
 was concurrently reviewed.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.7 cm above the carina.
 Right chest tube is present with it tip terminating near the right lung apex. 
 On concurrent review of chest CT dated ___, tiny right apical
 pneumothorax demonstrated on this x-ray is infact very small than what it
 appears.  Due to rotation of the patient, reliable comparison for interval
 changes in the lung including bibasal lung opacities was limited; however,
 within the limitations, increased volume loss at right lung base can be
 appreciated.  Mild bilateral pleural effusions are overall unchanged.
