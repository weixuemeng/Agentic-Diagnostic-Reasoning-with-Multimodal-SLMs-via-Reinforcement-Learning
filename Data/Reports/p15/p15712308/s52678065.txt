                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___ ACQUIRED AT 5:13 A.M.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-erect portable radiograph of chest was compared with
 prior radiographs through ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 A right subclavian line ends at lower SVC, right chest tube with its tip near
 the right lung apex are unchanged in position.  Heterogeneous opacification of
 the lung parenchyma is persistent since ___, but unchanged since
 ___.  Contribution from atelectasis or pneumonia cannot be
 certainly defined.  Moreover, in the background of emphysema  determination of
 each components is further limited.  Bibasal atelectasis left side more than
 right and presumably mild bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. 
 Mild-to-moderate-sized heart, mediastinal and hilar contours have similar
 appearance.
