 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hemothorax, status post chest tube pulled, evaluation for
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Status post chest tube removal.  There is an unchanged millimetric
 right apical pneumothorax without evidence of tension.  Unchanged lateral
 parenchymal opacities, suggesting atelectasis.  Unchanged moderate pulmonary
 edema and borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Presence of a minimal
 left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
