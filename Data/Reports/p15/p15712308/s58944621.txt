                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with recent fall, complicated by right rib
 fractures and hemothorax, status post chest tube removal with increasing
 oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST:
 
 Right subclavian catheter has been removed.  A small right apical pneumothorax
 persists.  There is moderate right and small left pleural effusion, with
 associated basilar atelectasis.  These do not appear significantly changed
 from one day prior.  There is mild vascular congestion, without frank edema. 
 The degree of congestion appears minimally improved from one day prior, though
 this could reflect positioning.  No new opacities to suggest pneumonia. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are grossly stable.
