                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post cardiac arrest, evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine AP view of the chest:  The endotracheal tube is no
 less than 7 cm above the carina.  A right internal jugular central venous
 catheter terminates at the approximate location of the cavoatrial junction. 
 There is an orogastric tube coursing through the esophagus, and below the
 inferior edge of the radiograph toward the location of the stomach.
 
 There is diffuse reticular opacification of the bilateral lung fields.  Lungs
 are otherwise clear.  There is minimal cardiomegaly.  Widening of the superior
 mediastinum is consistent with venous engorgement.  There is no pneumothorax
 or large pleural effusion.  There are surgical clips in the right upper
 quadrant, likely from cholecystectomy.  The aorta is tortuous and contains
 atherosclerotic calcification.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube approximately 7 cm above the carina, which could be
 advanced by 2 to 3 cm.
 2.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and signs of pulmonary vascular
 congestion likely secondary to resuscitation efforts.  However, underlying
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Consider reimaging after optimization of fluid
 status.
