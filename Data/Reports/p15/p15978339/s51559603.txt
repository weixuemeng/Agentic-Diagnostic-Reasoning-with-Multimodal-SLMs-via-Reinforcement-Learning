  1.
  
    1. Widening of the mediastinum is compatible with mediastinal hematoma as
  seen on the previous CT. Extrapleural opacity overlying the left lung apex is
  also compatible with hematoma.
    2. Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema within the neck and right
  lateral chest.
    3. Opacity in the right upper lung could reflect contusion.
    4. No definite pneumothorax on this supine only view.
    5. Multiple right-sided rib fractures and left first rib fracture.
  
 WET READ VERSION #___ ___ ___ 3:56 PM
  
  1. Widening of the mediastinum should be further evaluated with
  cross-sectional imaging in the setting of trauma. Extrapleural opacity in the
  left lung apex is worrisome for hematoma.
  2. Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema.
  3. Opacity in the right upper lung could reflect contusion.
  4. No definite pneumothorax on this supine only view.
  5. Right fourth and fifth rib fractures.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall with pneumothorax on outside hospital films. Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Bedside, supine frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ at 13:52
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is extensive pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema within the
 right neck and right lateral chest.  There is no definite pneumothorax on this
 supine view even though there was one demonstrated on the previous CT is.
 
 There is widening of the superior mediastinum likely reflective of mediastinal
 hematoma. Additionally, extrapleural opacity overlying of the left lung apex
 is compatible with extrapleural soft tissue hematoma. Opacity involving the
 right upper lobe could reflect contusion.  There are multiple right-sided rib
 fractures and left first rib fracture, better demonstrated on the previous CT
 count. Angulation of the left midclavicle likely relates to prior injury.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Widening of the mediastinum is compatible with mediastinal hematoma as seen
 on the previous CT. Extrapleural opacity overlying the left lung apex is also
 compatible with hematoma.
 2. Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema within the neck and right
 lateral chest.
 3. Opacity in the right upper lung could reflect contusion.
 4. No definite pneumothorax on this supine only view.
 5. Multiple right-sided rib fractures and left first rib fracture.
