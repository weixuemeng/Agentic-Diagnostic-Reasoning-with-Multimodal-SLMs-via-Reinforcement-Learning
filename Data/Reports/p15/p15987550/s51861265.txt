                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and fever, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Minimal opacification at the right lung base most likely
 represents atelectasis, less likely infectious process in the correct clinical
 setting.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
