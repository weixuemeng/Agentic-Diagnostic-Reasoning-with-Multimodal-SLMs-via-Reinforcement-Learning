 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with hemorrhagic stroke and altered mental status

 a retrocardiac opacity in the mid and lower left lung that likely represents a
 combination of consolidation and volume loss.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  A
 small pleural effusion on the left cannot be ruled out.  An ET tube ends 6 cm
 from the carina.  Enteric tube ends in the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity likely representing consolidation and volume
 loss in the mid and lower left lung.
