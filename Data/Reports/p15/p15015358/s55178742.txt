                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia, assess for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Portable upright AP chest radiograph was obtained.  Consolidation throughout
 the right mid lung is improved with slightly worsened dense consolidation of
 the left lower lobe.  No pneumothorax is seen though left basal effusion would
 be difficult to exclude.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Worsened left basal consolidation with slight improvement to
 opacity in the right midlung consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
