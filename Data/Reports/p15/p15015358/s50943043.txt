                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with acute desaturation.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 SUPINE PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Overall aeration of the right lower
 lobe appears significantly improved compared to prior.  Complete opacification
 of the left lower lobe appears unchanged and may reflect atelectasis or
 pneumonia.  There is no interstitial pulmonary edema.  A component of the left
 basilar opacity may be due to a small effusion.  No pneumothorax is evident. 
 Surgical clips are visualized within the left lower quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of the right lower lobe though with persistent
 opacification of the retrocardiac region.
