 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:30 PM
  Markedly increased bilateral pulmonary opacities, concerning for worsening
  edema and/or infection. Increased right pleural effusion and new or newly
  apparent moderate left pleural effusion. If edema is clinically suspected,
  repeat radiograph after diuresis (if clinically appropriate) is recommended to
  evaluate for change and re-evaluate underlying consolidations. Pigtail
  gastrostomy catheter projects over the upper abdomen, incompletely imaged.
  Discussed with ___ by phone at 8:25 p.m. on ___ at the time

                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON EXAM:  Portable AP chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with acute hypoxia to 70s, assess for acute change.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are diffuse severe opacities in both lungs, especially in the
 periphery, which are worsening; these are more prominent in the right upper
 lobe and the left lower lobe.  There are also small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Widened mediastinum is stable.  Heart size cannot be assessed on
 this study.  Right PICC  is present whose tip cannot be clearly seen but
 likely resides in the upper SVC. Catheter projecting over the upper abdomen
 also seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  worsening pneumonia.
