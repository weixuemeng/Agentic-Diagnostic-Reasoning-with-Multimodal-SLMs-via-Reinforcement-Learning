                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of a pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  Compared to the
 prior studies, a recurring moderate right possibly loculated pleural effusion,
 an unchanged small left-sided pleural effusion, prominent intralobular lines,
 preservation or reticulation and thickened fissure lines indicate
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema that has increased compared to the prior
 study.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Bibasilar opacities likley
 represented atelectasis. No pneumothorax is visualized.  Left pectoral
 pacemaker with leads ending in the right atrium and right ventricle is
 unchanged in position.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Preservation of reticulations and a recurring moderate right,
 possibly loculated, pleural effusion and progressive interstitial
 abnormalities could be mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
