                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change in a patient with respiratory
 failure and history of congestive heart failure and lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed and
 compared to the prior studies.  Persistent consolidation of the right
 mid-to-lower lung and a moderate right pleural effusion are slighlty
 increased.  Bilateral increased interstitial markings are consistent with
 increased moderate pulmonary edema.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are relatively unchanged.  A left pectoral pacer has leads ending in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased moderate pulmonary edema.
 2.  Right lung consolidation and moderate right pleural effusion are slightly
 increased and related to the patient's lung cancer.
