                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT torso from ___
 dated ___ at 12:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Aortic
 knob is calcified.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is seen.  The
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is
 noted.  A new moderate to large right pleural effusion is present, which
 appears to be partially loculated laterally.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 Right basilar opacification likely reflects compressive atelectasis.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 2. Moderate to large right pleural effusion which is partially loculated.
 
 3. Right basilar opacity which likely reflects compressive atelectasis.
