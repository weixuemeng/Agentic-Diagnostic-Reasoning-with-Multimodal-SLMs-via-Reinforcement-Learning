                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pulmonary edema in a patient with shortness of
 breath, congestive heart failure and lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___
 and CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed and
 compared to the prior studies.  Persistence of large scale consolidation in
 the right lung since ___ is highly suggestive of bronchoalveolar
 carcinoma or infection.  Since ___, profusion of diffuse interstitial
 abnormality is consistent with known non small cell lung cancer.  There is no
 pulmonary edema or vascular engorgement.  Normal heart, mediastinal and
 pleural surfaces.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistence of large scale consolidation in the right lung and
 extensive interstitial abnormaity is suggestive of bronchoalveolar carcinoma
 or infection in this patient with known lung cancer.
