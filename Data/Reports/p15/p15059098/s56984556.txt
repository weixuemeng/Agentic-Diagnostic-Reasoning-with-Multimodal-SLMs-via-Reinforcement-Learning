                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bronchoscopy, to assess for inflation of the lung.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 substantial re-expansion of the left lung with only mild opacification at the
 bases and a streak in the upper zone consistent with residual atelectatic
 change.  This probably reflects removal of a mucus plug.
 
 The right lung is essentially clear.
