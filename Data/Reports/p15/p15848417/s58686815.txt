 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:00 AM
  
  
  
  Pulmonary edema is improved since ___. There is diffuse interstitial
  abnormality compatible with history of pulmonary fibrosis. There is moderate
  bibasilar atelectasis. A curvilinear lucency in the region of the right
  hemidiaphragm may reflect aerated lung between the diaphragm and atelectasis
  although subdiaphragmatic free air cannot be completely excluded. Dedicated
  radiographs of the abdomen with left lateral decubitus or upright views are
  recommended.
  
  There is no pneumothorax. No radiopaque foreign body is detected in the
  airways.
  
   The findings were telephoned to Dr. ___ by ___ at 19:40,
  ___, ___ min after discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with with history of atrial fibrillation on
 warfarin, arrhythmia (further information unavailable) status post pacemaker
 placement, pulmonary fibrotic disease, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary
 hypertension who initially presented to an outside hospital post-fall  // Pt
 possibly aspirated tablet.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower during this hospitalization, compared to ___,
 and there was initially substantial pulmonary vascular engorgement which has
 improved. The extent of interstitial pulmonary abnormality with bibasilar
 fibrosis is now comparable to recent baseline.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 chronic.  There is no pneumonia or appreciable pleural effusion. Transvenous
 right atrial right ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses.
