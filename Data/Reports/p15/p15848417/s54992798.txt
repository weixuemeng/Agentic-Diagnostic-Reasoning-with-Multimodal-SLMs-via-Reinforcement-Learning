                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Biventricular pacemaker upgrade, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 Compared with the prior study, a three-lead pacemaker is now present. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 Again seen are diffuse increased interstitial markings, most pronounced at the
 bases, with retrocardiac air bronchograms, very similar to the appearance on
 the ___ radiograph.  This apparently relates to a known diffuse
 interstitial abnormality and bibasilar fibrosis.  Prominence of the right
 hilum is similar to the prior film.
