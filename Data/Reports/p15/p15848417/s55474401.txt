                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Biventricular pacemaker upgrade.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 19:01 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Again seen is a three-lead pacemaker, similar in appearance.  No pneumothorax
 is detected.  
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Again noted are diffuse
 increased interstitial markings, increased retrocardiac collapse and/or
 consolidatio,n and probable atelectasis at the right base, in a patient with
 known diffuse interstitial abnormality and bibasilar fibrosis.  Hilar
 prominence is unchanged.
