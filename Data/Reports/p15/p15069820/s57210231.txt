                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Unrestrained passenger in high-speed motor vehicle collision. 
 Question acute injury.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The most left lateral aspect of the chest is excluded.  The patient
 is intubated, the endotracheal tube terminating in the mid trachea.  The lung
 volumes are low.  It is difficult to evaluate cardiac or mediastinal
 structures on this limited view; an overlying trauma board including a
 vertical rod, obscures these structures.  Patchy retrocardiac and right upper
 lobe opacities can be discerned, however.  There is no clear evidence for
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited view showing patchy non-specific right upper lobe and
 left basilar opacities, otherwise unremarkable.
