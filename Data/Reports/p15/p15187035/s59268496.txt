                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate port placement. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest CT dated ___, and chest
 radiographs dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post wedge resections of the right upper lobe, right
 lower lobe, and left upper lobe for metastatic sarcoma.  Stable, resultant
 postsurgical scarring and suture lines are identified within these regions.  A
 large pleural based mass is seen within the left lateral lung, comparable in
 size relative to the recent chest CT examination. There has been interval
 placement of a left-sided subclavian central venous catheter, the tip of which
 is seen within the lower SVC.  There is no evidence of consolidation,
 pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left Port-A-Cath terminating in the lower SVC.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax. 
 
 2.  Large, pleural-based lass within the lateral left lung, comparable in size
 as compared to the recent chest CT examination.
