                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post left upper lobe wedge resection.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of a left-sided chest tube without
 evidence of pneumothorax.  There is otherwise no significant change compared
 to prior examination with redemonstration of stable left hemidiaphragm
 elevation and a trace left-sided pleural effusion with basal atelectasis.  The
 right lung remains essentially clear.  Left-sided port is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of left-sided chest tube without pneumothorax.
