 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post right upper lobe and right lower lobe wedge
 resection, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the postoperative changes
 on the right, notably the areas of pleural thickening, have decreased in
 extent and severity.  On the current image, no pneumothorax on the right is
 seen.  The areas of scarring in the right lung parenchyma and at the left lung
 bases are constant in appearance.  The free air in the soft tissues has
 completely resolved.
