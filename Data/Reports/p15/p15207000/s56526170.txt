 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:  The heart size is normal.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal width is prominent despite the patient's
 rightward rotation, raising the question of mediastinal fat or
 lymphadenopathy.  A triangular-shaped juxtacardiac opacity lung lesion
 projects over the left posterior 8th rib.  6-week follow-up chest radiograph
 is recommended to exclude a lung nodule.
