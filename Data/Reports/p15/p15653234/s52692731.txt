                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with weakness and SOB  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no significant interval change compared to the recent radiograph on
 ___.  Lungs remain hyperinflated.  Vague opacity persists over the
 right lung base which may represent scarring, atelectasis, or early
 consolidation.  No signs of pneumonia or edema.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures
 appear stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Projects over the right lung base, question atelectasis versus scarring versus
 early pneumonia.  Followup to resolution advised.
