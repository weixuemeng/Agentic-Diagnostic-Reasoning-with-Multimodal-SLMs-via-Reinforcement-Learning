                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with dyspnea, eval interval change in effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 There is a large right pleural effusion and a moderate left pleural effusion,
 resulting in bibasilar compressive atelectasis.  The pulmonary vascular
 congestion appears to have improved, though this could be secondary to patient
 in upright position.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with
 associated babasilar atelectasis.
