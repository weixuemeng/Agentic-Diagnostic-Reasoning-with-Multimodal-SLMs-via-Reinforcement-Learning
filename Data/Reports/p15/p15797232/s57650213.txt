                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, rule out pulmonary process.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 5:05 a.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, the right subclavian picc line has been removed.
 Otherwise, no definite change is identified. No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Tracheostomy tube again noted.  Again seen are low lung volumes, with some
 patchy opacity at the left base.  The extreme left costophrenic angle is less
 well seen on today's exam, ? due to atelectasis or trace fluid.  No gross
 effusion.  Mild prominence of pulmonary vessels is likely related to the low
 inspiratory volumes.  Minimal atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region.  
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Low inspiratory volumes, with bibasilar atelectasis.  Possibility of some
 patchy opacity at the left base cannot be excluded.  
 2) Given the low lung volumes, no definite CHF.
