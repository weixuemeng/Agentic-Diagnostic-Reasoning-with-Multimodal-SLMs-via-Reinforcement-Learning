                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates within 1.5 cm above the carina
 and is directed towards the origin of the right main bronchus, as communicated
 by phone to Dr. ___ at 9:10 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery. 
 Other indwelling devices are unchanged in position.  Lung volumes remain low,
 and cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for this factor. 
 Nonspecific bibasilar opacities appear slightly improved allowing for
 differences in lung volumes.  Remainder of lungs are clear.
