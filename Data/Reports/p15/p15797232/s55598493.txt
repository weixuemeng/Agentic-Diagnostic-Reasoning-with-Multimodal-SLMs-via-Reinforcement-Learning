                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes.
 Bibasilar atelectatic changes persist.  There is some prominence of central
 vessels, raising the possibility of some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube again measures only about 1.5 cm above the
 carina.  Other monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
