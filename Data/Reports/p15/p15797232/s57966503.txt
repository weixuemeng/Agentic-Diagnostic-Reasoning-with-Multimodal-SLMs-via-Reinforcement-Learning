                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible ventilator associated pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low exaggerating prominence of the cardiac
 silhouette and vascular crowding, although compared to prior exam there is
 haziness of the pulmonary vasculature suggestive of a component of pulmonary
 edema.  Low lung volumes are associated with bibasilar atelectasis.  A
 tracheostomy tube is in proper positioning.  A right PICC is again seen with
 the tip terminating in the right atrium.  There is no large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of mild pulmonary edema.  No focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
