                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p intubation.  Evaluate endotracheal tube
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The new endotracheal tube tip projects 1.4 cm above the carina and should be
 withdrawn at least 2 cm for optimal placement.
 
 The large left infrahilar consolidation is worse, with increased opacification
 of the left lung.  There is associated leftward mediastinal shift and a more
 superiorly displaced left lower lobe bronchus.  Findings suggest possible left
 upper a lingual collapse with left basal atelectasis and left-sided effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  The new endotracheal tube tip projects 1.4 cm above the carina and should
 be withdrawn at least 2 cm for optimal placement.
 
 2.  Worsening left lung opacification, likely a combination of upper lobe
 collapse and effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were communicated via telephone by Dr.
 ___ to Dr. ___ at 11:30 on ___, ___ min after discovery.
