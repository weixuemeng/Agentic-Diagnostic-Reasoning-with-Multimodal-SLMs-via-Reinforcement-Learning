                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p intubation with right fem art stent migrated to the right
 pulm artery, please eval for interval change  // ___M s/p intubation with right
 fem art stent migrated to the right pulm artery, please eval for interval
 change    ___M s/p intubation with right fem art stent migrated to the right
 pulm artery, please eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube
 now measures approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  Although difficult to see
 due to change in patient obliquity, the vascular stent again appears to have a
 stable position projected over the right lower hilum.
 The left subclavian catheter tip again is at the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic veins.  Enteric tube extends to the upper stomach, were
 crosses the lower margin of the image.
 The patient has taken a better inspiration.  Continued area of increased
 opacification in the left perihilar region and lower lung could well represent
 merely atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
