                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M GSW s/p exlap, SBR,   EIV stent at OSH; to OR here coded on
 table prior to start s/p EIA primary repair, colon resection s/p anastomosis,
 now c/b colonic and small bowel fistula  // ?PNA    ?PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the nasogastric and Dobhoff tubes
 have been removed.  Right subclavian catheter again extends to the mid portion
 of the SVC.
 The patient has taken a better inspiration.  Continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with minimal if any elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
 Right basilar opacification most likely represents streaks of atelectasis. 
 However, in the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to
 unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a
 lateral view.
