                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p GSW to abdomen s/p ex-lap, SBR w/anastamosis, colonic
 primary repair, sigmoid and colon resection in discontinuity, left EIV stent,
 left CIA primary repair who coded intraoperatively with ROSC after CPR.
 Patient has received massive transfusion and currently maintaining hemodynamic
 stability.  // eval for tube migration   eval for tube migration
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the endotracheal
 tube now measures approximately 5.8 cm above the carina.  Other monitoring
 support devices are unchanged.  Although difficult to assess, the arterial
 stent appears to have progressed more distally.
 Extensive retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the
 left lower lobe and probable effusion.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with some pulmonary vascular congestion.
