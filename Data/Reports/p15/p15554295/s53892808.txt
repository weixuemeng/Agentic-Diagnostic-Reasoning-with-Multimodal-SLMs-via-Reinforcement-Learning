                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man confirm ETT and NGT position  // confirm tube
 position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The superior segment of the right lower lobe is
 collapsed.  The left lower lobe is completely opacified which may likely
 represent atelectatic collapse and less likely a consolidation.  The mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged.  Moderate to severe cardiomegaly
 is stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are unchanged.  The right PICC line terminates in the mid
 SVC.  2 NG tubes terminate in the mid stomach.  The ET tube is approximately 6
 cm from the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube is in appropriate position.  The NG tubes are in appropriate
 positions.  A retrocardiac opacity may represent left lower lobe atelectasis
 and less likely a pneumonia.
