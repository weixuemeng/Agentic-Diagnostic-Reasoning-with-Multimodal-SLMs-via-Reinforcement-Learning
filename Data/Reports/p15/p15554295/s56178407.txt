                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p GSW to abdomen w/injury to small bowel, large bowel, left
 CIA and EIV, s/p SBR and primary small bowel anastamosis, delayed colonic
 anastomosis c/b leak, now re-presenting to TSICU after washout, diverting
 ileostomy, malecot drain placement, and abethera placement on ___ for leak,
 remains intubated, on zosyn.  // daily eval
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15 42
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube appears to been removed.  2 orogastric type tubes are present.  1
 Extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film. Linear radiodensity could
 represent the tip of acute Dobbhoff tube.  If so, it overlies the gastric
 fundus. Right IJ central line tip overlies distal SVC.  No pneumothorax
 detected.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, likely accentuating the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and vascular markings.  Allowing for this, cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly unchanged.  There is upper zone redistribution and
 diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  This appears slightly more
 pronounced than on the prior study.  Possible small left effusion.  There is
 increased retrocardiac density, with air bronchograms, consistent left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to prior.  There is patchy opacity
 at the right base.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent interval removal of ET tube.  Clinical correlation requested, given
 the provided history.
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  Even so, there appears to be CHF, slightly worse.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  The differential includes an
 infectious pneumonic consolidation.
 
 Patchy opacity right base, non-specific in appearance.  This could be early
 alveolar edema, though a focal pneumonic infiltrate or area of aspiration
 pneumonitis could also account for this appearance.
