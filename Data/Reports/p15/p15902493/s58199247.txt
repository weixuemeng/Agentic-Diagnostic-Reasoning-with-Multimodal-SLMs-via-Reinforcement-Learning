                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 14:55
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with subarachnoid hemorrhage, requiring
 emergent reintubation.  Evaluate position of endotracheal tube.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 5:55.
 
 Portable upright chest film, ___ at 14:55 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube courses to the left of the spine and has its tip
 approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  Subclavian central line has its tip in
 the mid-to-distal SVC.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the
 diaphragm with the tip likely located within the stomach.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is a persistent right superior
 mediastinal mass, which is felt to most likely correspond to a thyroid goiter
 as evident on a CTA of the head and neck performed on ___.  Lung volumes
 are slightly decreased with interval appearance of a patchy opacity at both
 bases, likely reflecting patchy atelectasis.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
