  1.  Lines and tubes in place.
  2.  Stable right upper mediastinal mass.
  3.  Right middle lobe atelectasis.
  4.  Question of narrowed trachea beyond the ET tube - CT may be considered is
  clinical concern for poor aeration exists.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old female with right mediastinal mass.
 
 STUDY:  Supine portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and multiple chest radiographs
 from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is rotated to the left.  The endotracheal tube sits
 just below the clavicular heads; the carina is not well seen, and while chest
 radiography is not ideal to assess for such, the trachea distal to the ET tube
 appears narrowed.  The endogastric tube side port is well below the GE
 junction.  The left-sided central line tip in the mid SVC.
 
 The heart size is within normal limits.  Mediastinal contours again
 demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease at the aortic knob and a large
 mass approximately 8.5 x 6 cm in the coronal plane dominating the right upper
 mediastinum (better characterized on prior CT).  Right middle lobe atelectasis
 is new.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes as described above.
 2.  Stable right upper mediastinal mass.
 3.  Right middle lobe atelectasis.
 4.  Question of narrowed trachea beyond the ET tube - CT may be considered is
 clinical concern for poor aeration exists.
