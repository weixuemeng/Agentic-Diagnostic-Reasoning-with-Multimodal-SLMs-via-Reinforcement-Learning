                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with tracheostomy.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Supine portable chest radiograph from ___ and chest
 CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A tracheostomy catheter appears in standard
 unchanged position.  A catheter overlying the right mid clavicular line
 appears similar to prior examination, possibly a VP shunt. Elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm is unchanged from prior.  Linear bibasilar opacities are
 unchanged and likely reflect atelectasis.  No confluent consolidation is
 identified.  A significant widening of the right paratracheal stripe
 corresponds with a known large thyroid goiter, better characterized on prior
 chest CT.  Leftward tracheal deviation appears stable.  The remainder of the
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits for age.  The heart
 size is borderline or slightly enlarged.  There is pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Grossly stable thyroid goiter causing widening of the right paratracheal
 stripe.
 2.  Unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  No evidence of pneumonia or acute pulmonary edema.
