                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:25 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a tracheostomy, transferred from outside
 hospital for mucus plugging secretions and rales.  Suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 The right hemidiaphragm became elevated between ___, even more
 pronounced today.  Some of this could be due to subpulmonic pleural effusion
 but I would investigate either phrenic nerve palsy or complete right lower
 lobe and perhaps middle lobe collapse.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable with
 the mediastinum midline.  A large cervicothoracic mass presumably a goiter
 displaces the trachea to the left.  Left lung is clear.  A left PIC line ends
 roughly at the origin of the SVC.
