                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post coiling of right PCOM aneurysm, VP shunt and IVC
 filter placement for preop evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A VP shunt is seen coursing through the right hemithorax into the
 right abdomen.  Tracheostomy tube is noted. Though this study is not intended
 for evaluation of the airway, the trachea does not appear much larger than the
 tracheostomy tube.  A Dobbhoff feeding tube is seen coursing into the proximal
 duodenum.  IVC filter projects over the right border of the L2 and L3
 vertebral bodies.  Large mass in the right upper lung causes rightward
 tracheal deviation but is better assessed on the prior chest CT.  Marked
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again noted, with resultant right
 basal atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right hemidiaphragmatic elevation with resultant atelectasis,
 perhaps a result of phrenic nerve paralysis secondary to the large right
 mediastinal mass.
