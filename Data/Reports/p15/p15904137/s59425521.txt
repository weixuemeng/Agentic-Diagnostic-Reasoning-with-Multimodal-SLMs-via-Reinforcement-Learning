                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 4:54
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Intubated with subdural hemorrhage, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 12:30.
 
 An AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:54 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube and left subclavian central line unchanged in position. 
 A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Heart remains stably enlarged.  The aorta is somewhat unfolded
 and tortuous.  There is increasing perihilar prominence and indistinctness of
 the pulmonary vasculature, which suggests a component of mild perihilar edema.
 In addition, more patchy opacity at the right base is seen, which could
 represent worsening atelectasis, although a developing pneumonia should also
 be considered.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
