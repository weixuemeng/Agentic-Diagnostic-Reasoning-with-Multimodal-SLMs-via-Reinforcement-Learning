                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with likely aspiration and desaturation. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest and upper abdomen
 demonstrate a moderately kyphotic patient.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits.  The lungs are low in volume but relatively clear. 
 Trace retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis, although aspiration is
 not excluded.  There is no pneumothorax or vascular congestion.  Air-filled
 prominent bowel loops are seen.  There is generalized osseous
 demineralization.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.  Probable left basilar atelectasis.  Aspiration
 is a consideration.
 2.  Prominent air-filled bowel loops.
