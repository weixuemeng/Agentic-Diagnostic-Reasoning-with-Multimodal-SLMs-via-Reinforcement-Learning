                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 09:21
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette appears unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities are not substantially changed in the interval.  A
 small left pleural effusion is likely present.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from prior chest radiograph performed earlier
 in the day with continued bibasilar airspace opacities, potentially
 atelectasis, but infection is not completely excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.  Probable small left pleural effusion.  No pulmonary edema.
