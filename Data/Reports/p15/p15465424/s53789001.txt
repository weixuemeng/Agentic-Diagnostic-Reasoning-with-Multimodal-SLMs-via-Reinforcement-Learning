                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with recent MVR on ___ p/w n/v, lethargy and new oxygen
 requirement.  // acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates median sternotomy wires
 which appear intact.  A prosthetic mitral valve is noted.  There is a small to
 moderate right pleural effusion decreased in size relative to prior study. 
 Several opacities project over the right lower lung zone, likely artifactual
 and superimposed osseous structures.  Streaky opacity within the left upper
 lobe is unchanged.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflect
 small pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No evidence
 of pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small to moderate right pleural effusion decreased in size relative to prior
 study.  Small left pleural effusion.  No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
