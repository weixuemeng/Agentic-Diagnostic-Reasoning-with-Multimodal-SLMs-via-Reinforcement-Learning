                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute cholecystitis, AS and hypoxia.  //
 Please evaluate for cause of hypoxia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive consolidation has worsened in most of the right lung and base of the
 left lung. The sparing of the mid and upper regions of the left lung makes it
 less likely that this is pulmonary edema. Instead pulmonary hemorrhage or
 widespread aspiration pneumonia should be considered. Heart size is normal.
 Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial. No pneumothorax. Thoracic
 aorta is generally large and tortuous
