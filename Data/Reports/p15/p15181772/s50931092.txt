                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with elevated troponin and white count. 
 Question acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same-day reference radiograph from___.  CT from the
 same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of this semi-upright patient demonstrates low
 lung volumes accentuating bronchovascular crowding.  There appears to be
 increased mild perihilar vascular congestion without frank edema.  A rounded
 density in the right cardiophrenic angle may corresponding to a pulmonary mass
 in the right lung base is seen on same-day reference CT.  The heart is normal
 in size.  The thoracic aorta is mildly unfolded.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2.  Right lower lobe lung mass is better demonstrated on accompanying
 reference CT.
 3.  Low lung volumes.
