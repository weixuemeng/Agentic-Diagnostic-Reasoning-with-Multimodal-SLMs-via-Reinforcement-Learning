                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are low, which accentuates the
 cardiomediastinal size and limits evaluation of the lung bases.  There is no
 evidence of significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A focal
 consolidation in the left lung base is difficult to exclude.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged allowing for low lung volumes.  The
 trachea is midline.  There is no pulmonary edema or vascular engorgement.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Equivocal left basilar pneumonia in the setting of low lung
 volumes.
