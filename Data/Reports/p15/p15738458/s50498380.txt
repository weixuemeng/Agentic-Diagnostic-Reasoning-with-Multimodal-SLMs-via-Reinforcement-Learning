                                 FINAL REPORT
 SERIES OF PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPHS OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 Three serial radiographs of the chest are submitted for interpretation.  On
 the initial radiograph, a feeding tube coils in the esophagus and is
 subsequently directed cephalad with tip terminating above the thoracic inlet
 level.  On the second radiograph, the tube coils in the lower thoracic
 esophagus with a similar cephalad course and termination above the thoracic
 inlet level.  On the final radiograph, there is no longer coiling of the tube,
 but the tip is located at the GE junction level.  At the time of this
 dictation, a repeat chest radiograph has been obtained and dictated
 separately, documenting advancement of this tube.  With the exception of the
 above described feeding tube placement and re-positioning, there has not been
 a substantial change in the appearance of the chest since the previous study
 of earlier the same date.
