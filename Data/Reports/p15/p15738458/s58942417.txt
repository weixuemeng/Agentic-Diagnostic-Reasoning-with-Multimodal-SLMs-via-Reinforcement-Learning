                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval re-positioning of a feeding tube, which now terminates in
 the proximal stomach but the proximal portion of the tip is just above the GE
 junction level.  Nasogastric tube terminates in the region of the pylorus. 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard position.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 normal, and imaged portions of the lungs are clear (small portion of right
 lung laterally has been excluded).
