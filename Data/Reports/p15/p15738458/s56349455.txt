                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single semi-upright AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intracranial bleed status post right craniotomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 2.4 cm above
 the level of the carina which has advanced approximately 1 cm since the prior
 study.  Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm into
 the left upper quadrant inferior aspect not included on the image.  External
 artifact projects over the right lung apex making this area difficult to
 assess.  Elsewhere, there is no focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube has been advanced approximately 1-1.5 cm and
 now terminates approximately 2.4 cm above the level of the carina. 
 
 Clear lungs.
