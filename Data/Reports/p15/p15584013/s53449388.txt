                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, neutropenia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided subclavian central venous catheter is again seen,
 unchanged in position, terminating in the low SVC.  There is increased mild
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm which may be due to an underlying
 subpulmonic effusion.  The right lung is grossly clear.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Slight prominence
 of the left hilum is stable.
