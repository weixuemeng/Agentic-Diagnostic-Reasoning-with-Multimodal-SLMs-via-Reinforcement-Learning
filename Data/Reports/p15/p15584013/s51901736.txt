                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough  // Eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Again seen is prominence of the
 central pulmonary arteries, suggestive of possible pulmonary arterial
 hypertension. No definite new areas of consolidation are identified.  In
 comparison to the most recent examination, there is left upper lobe bronchial
 wall thickening.  There is no large pneumothorax.  Possible, trace bilateral
 pleural effusions are present.  A right-sided chest port remains in stable
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New bronchial wall thickening in the left upper lobe may be consistent with
 infection/ inflammation.  Definite focal consolidation is not identified.
