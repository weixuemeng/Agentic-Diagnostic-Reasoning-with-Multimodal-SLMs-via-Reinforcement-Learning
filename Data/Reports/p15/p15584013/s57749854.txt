                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo F with febrile neutropenia, persistently febrile despite
 tigecycline levifloxacin  // ___ yo F with febrile neutropenia, persistently
 febrile despite tigecycline levifloxacin    ___ yo F with febrile neutropenia,
 persistently febrile despite tigecycline levifloxacin
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and chest CT from ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Port-A-Cath catheter.  Terminates at the level of lower SVC, unchanged. 
 Compared to both previous chest radiograph in chest CT there is substantial
 increase in widespread parenchymal opacities nodular and reticular, with
 slightly more peripheral than central predominance, highly concerning to
 progression of multifocal infection that has been mentioned on the previous
 chest CT.  Some of the areas particularly nodular, for example in the right
 mid lung, lateral to the projection of the Port-A-Cath port and does fungal
 infection is a high possibility.  More consolidative appearance seen
 projecting over the spine on the lateral view, new and potentially might
 represent additional substantially areas of infection, either fungal or
 bacterial.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 Further assessment with chest CT is required for pre size characterization of
 this finding, highly concerning for infectious process.
