                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent bone marrow transplant now with fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are hyperinflated and there is flattening of the diaphragm,
 suggestive of COPD. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. On
 the lateral view, suprahilar bronchial wall thickening corresponds to the
 abnormalities on chest CT scans over the past 6 months, presumably chronic
 bronchial inflammation, not an acute condition.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
