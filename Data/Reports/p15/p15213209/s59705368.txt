                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Gunshot wound, needs MRI to assess for evidence of metal from
 gunshot wound to right chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  Sutures are midline and
 intact.  Additional postoperative changes evident in the right upper lung with
 chain sutures and relative lucency at the apex consistent with reported
 resection.  Three additional surgical clips project over the right upper
 mediastinum.  An additional 2 mm metallic density is in close proximity to
 this region and likely represents a surgical clip viewed on end; however,
 without a lateral view to confirm, shrapnel related to known gunshot wound is
 not excluded.
 
 No focal opacification concerning for pneumonia.  Cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Faint
 asymmetry of lung base opacifications is likely related to scoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Post-traumatic and surgical changes noted in the right upper lung
 with a 2 mm metallic density likely representing a surgical clip viewed on
 end, but cannot exclude shrapnel related to gunshot wound.  Recommend
 conventional frontal and lateral radiographs. Cardiomegaly.
