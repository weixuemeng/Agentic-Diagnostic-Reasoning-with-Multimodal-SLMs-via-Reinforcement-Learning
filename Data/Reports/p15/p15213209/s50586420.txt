                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Need for MRV for access with question of shrapnel related to
 right-sided gunshot wound.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Additional views were requested to evaluate right upper mediastinum
 linear metallic densities.  Magnified examination reveals that these are four
 surgical clips. No evidence of shrapnel. Remainder of examination is unchanged
 with chain sutures related to right upper lobe resection.  Prominence of the
 interstitium more apparent on the current study due to differences in
 technique and may reflect chronic underlying lung disease.  No focal
 opacification concerning for pneumonia present.  There is mild blunting of the
 bilateral costophrenic angles, right greater than left, possibly reflecting
 trace effusions versus scarring. Stable cardiomegaly. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Metallic densities projecting over right upper mediastinum,
 appearance most consistent with clips.  No foreign bodies concerning for
 gunshot wound tract now identified. Stable cardiomegaly.
