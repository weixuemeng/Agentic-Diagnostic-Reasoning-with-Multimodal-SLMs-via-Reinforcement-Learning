                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of sarcoidosis, now status post laparoscopic Nissen on
 post-op day #2 with respiratory desaturations, here to evaluate for recurrent
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased from the most recent
 prior study.  Increased opacification of the bilateral bases is likely
 reflective of atelectasis in the post-operative setting of low lung volumes. 
 Prominent lung markings raise the possibility of chronic lung disease.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are present.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The
 cardiac silhouette is likely within normal limits allowing for low lung
 volumes.  No overt pulmonary edema is present.  Calcified hilar and
 mediastinal lymph nodes are re-demonstrated, compatible with sequela of known
 sarcoidosis.  Multiple healed right posterior rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis in the
 post-operative setting of low lung volumes. Small pleural effusions.
 2.  Stable calcified hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes compatible with known
 sarcoidosis.
 3.  Suggestion of chronic lung disease.
