                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fall, trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Underlying trauma board partially obscures the view.  The left lateral lower
 hemithorax is not fully included on the image.  Given this, no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower left lateral hemithorax not fully included on the image. 
 Otherwise, no evidence of acute intrathoracic process.
