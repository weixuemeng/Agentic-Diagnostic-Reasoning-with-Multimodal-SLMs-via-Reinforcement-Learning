                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lower extremity swelling.  Evaluate for cardiomegaly.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  The lung volumes are slightly
 low.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 heart size appears mildly enlarged but this is likely due to the AP technique.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.  The imaged upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.  The bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
