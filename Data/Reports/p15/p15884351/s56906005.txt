                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with asthma, DM p/w dyspnea of 1 days duration 
 // ?pulmonary process worsening ?acute abnormality
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  2 prior radiograph from ___ is limited given.  Changes in
 patient position.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is rightward rotation of the patient. Allowing for changes due to
 patient positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. The
 bilateral hila are normal.
 
 The previously seen right basilar opacity appears more prominent, however,
 this may simply reflect change in position of now layering effusion in
 conjunction with lower lung volumes and differences in radiographic technique
 in comparison to prior exam; however, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 this could also be compatible with sequela of aspiration or pneumonia.  There
 is stable appearance of left basilar atelectasis. Otherwise, there are no
 focal lung consolidations.
 
 Again seen is a small right pleural effusion, now layering posteriorly.  There
 is no left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Stable small right pleural effusion which now layers posteriorly.
 2.  Possible increase in right base opacification which likely represents
 basilar atelectasis, however, in appropriate clinical setting could reflect
 sequela of aspiration or developing pneumonia.
 3.  Stable left basilar atelectasis.
