 INDICATION:  Acute desaturation, rule out flash pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 slightly decreased, likely reflecting a lesser inspiratory effort.  Minimal
 areas of atelectasis at both lung bases.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No evidence of pulmonary edema, no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.  No evidence of local hyperemia.
