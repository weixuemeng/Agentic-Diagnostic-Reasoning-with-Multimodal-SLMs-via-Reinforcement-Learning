                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with syncope and chest pain, rule out aortic
 dissection.
 
 COMPARISON: None. 
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  The aorta contour is normal. Both lungs are clear. There is no
 pleural abnormality.
 
 CTA is more sensitive for the diagnosis of aortic dissection, the diagnosis
 cannot be excluded on plain radiographs, although there are no findings to
 suggest it.
