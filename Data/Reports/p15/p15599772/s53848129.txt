                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with wheezes in the right lower lobe.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is blunting of posterior costophrenic angles suggestive of
 small effusions.  In addition, there is retrocardiac opacity silhouetting the
 medial portion of the left hemidiaphragm, potentially due to atelectasis or
 developing infiltrate.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  Cardiac silhouette is
 at upper limits of normal for technique.  The osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral effusions.  Retrocardiac opacity could be due to
 left lower lobe atelectasis given the relatively lower lung volumes, however,
 infectious process such as pneumonia is also possible.
