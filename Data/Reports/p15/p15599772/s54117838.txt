 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Systemic lupus, chronic pleural effusion, evaluate for
 interstitial process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the size of the cardiac
 silhouette has increased.  The shape of the cardiac silhouette suggests the
 presence of a pericardial effusion.  The suspicion should be excluded or
 confirmed by echocardiography.  The preexisting pleural effusions have mildly
 increased on the right and are stable on the left.  As a consequence of the
 effusions, areas of atelectasis are seen, but there is no evidence of fibrotic
 lung disease.  The lung parenchyma looks unremarkable.  Unremarkable hilar
 structures.
