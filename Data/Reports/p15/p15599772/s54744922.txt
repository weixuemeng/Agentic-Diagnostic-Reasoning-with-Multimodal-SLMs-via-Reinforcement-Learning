                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior CT abdomen and pelvis from ___ as well as a chest
 radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of lupus with
 shortness of breath, assess effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  As seen on yesterday's
 CT of the abdomen and pelvis, bilateral pleural effusions are evident, with
 apparent increase from yesterday.  There also appears to be development of
 pulmonary edema.  Bilateral compressive atelectasis also likely present.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  Findings may indicate fluid overload if there is
 associated renal dysfunction, though a cardiogenic cause cannot be excluded. 
 Bony structures appear intact.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema, worsening effusions, mild cardiomegaly.
