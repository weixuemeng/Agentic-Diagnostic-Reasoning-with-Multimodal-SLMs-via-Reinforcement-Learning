                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with transient hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous exam.  This accentuates the
 size of the cardiac silhouette which is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures
 is present without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Several
 clips are noted projecting over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen,
 compatible with fiducial markers.  Additionally within the left upper quadrant
 is a gastric lap band, in unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis.
 Infection is not completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
