 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with syncopal fall are right thoracic pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No rib
 fractures are identified.

 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Although no fractures are
 identified, the study is suboptimal for the detection of rib fractures and if
 there is further clinical concern dedicated rib views should be obtained.
