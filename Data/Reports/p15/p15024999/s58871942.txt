 angles which could be due to trace pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given differences

 No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Slight blunting of the bilateral
 posterior costophrenic angles suggests trace pleural effusions.
