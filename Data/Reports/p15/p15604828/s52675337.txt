                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F s/p fall down a flight of stairs // acute injuries
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine trauma chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Concurrent CT of the torso.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 2.1 cm from the carina. Enteric tube terminates in the
 stomach. Lung volumes are low. There is left lower lobe collapse and
 consolidation of the right base. Bibasilar consolidations better seen on CT
 are worrisome for aspiration. The heart is not enlarged. There is no
 mediastinal widening. There is no large pneumothorax, however the lung apices
 are excluded from view. Known right upper rib fractures are not seen on this
 study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left lower lobe collapse and consolidation of the right base may be
 secondary to aspiration.
 2. The ET tube terminates 2.1 cm from the carina
 3. Known right upper rib fractures are better seen on concurrent CT of the
 chest.
