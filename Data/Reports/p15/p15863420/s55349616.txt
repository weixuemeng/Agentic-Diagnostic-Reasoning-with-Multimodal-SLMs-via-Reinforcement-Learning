                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma, now presenting with fever, question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs appear
 clear bilaterally without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Multiple chronic vertebral
 compression fractures are redemonstrated, as is a displaced mid sternal
 fracture.  Multiple rib deformities are better assessed on the prior CT, and
 no definite acute rib fracture is evident.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No signs of pneumonia.  Chronic skeletal deformities including
 multiple rib fractures, sternal fracture, and thoracic compression fractures
 appear grossly stable.
