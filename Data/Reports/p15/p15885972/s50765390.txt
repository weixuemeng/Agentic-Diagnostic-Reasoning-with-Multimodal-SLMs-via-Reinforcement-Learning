  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes. An enteric
  tube is seen terminating within the gastric lumen. A right internal jugular
  central venous catheter is in unchanged position. Several lines project over
  the thorax presumably external to the patient. When compared to prior
  radiograph obtained 1 day prior, diffuse airspace opacities are seen with
  indistinct vasculature and likely a small left pleural effusion, findings
  which are thought select edema.

 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p hepatectomy POD#1 with thoracic epidural
 placement now with desaturation  // please assess for pneumothorax, pulmonary
 edema, atelectasis or other potential pulmonary process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, the patient has been extubated of.
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Bibasilar atelectasis has slightly
 improved on the right and worsened on the left, and note is made of a possible
 small left pleural effusion but no visible pneumothorax.
