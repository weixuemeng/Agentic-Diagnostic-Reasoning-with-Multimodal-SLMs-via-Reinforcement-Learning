                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Febrile neutropenia, acute shortness of breath, question of a
 fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC line is in
 unchanged position.  The lung volumes have slightly decreased, presumably
 caused by lesser inspiration.  As a consequence, there is increased crowding
 of vascular and parenchymal structures at the lung bases, right more than
 left.  Mild retrocardiac atelectasis.  However, no evidence of pulmonary edema
 or pleural effusions is seen.  No evidence of pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
