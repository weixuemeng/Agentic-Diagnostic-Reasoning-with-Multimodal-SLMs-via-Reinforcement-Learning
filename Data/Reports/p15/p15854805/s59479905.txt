                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status with AML and hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the tip of the central catheter
 is difficult to see, though it probably extends to the mid-to-lower portion of
 the SVC.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with minimal
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting minimal elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure.  No acute pneumonia.
