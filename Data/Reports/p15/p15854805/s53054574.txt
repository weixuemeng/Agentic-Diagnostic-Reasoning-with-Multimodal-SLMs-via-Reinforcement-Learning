                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with AML after chemotherapy
 with new cough.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.  Heart size
 and mediastinum are stable.  No definitive evidence of new consolidation to
 suggest infectious process is demonstrated within the limitations of this
 portable technique.  If patient's symptoms persist, evaluation with chest CT
 is required to exclude the potential presence of radiographic occult
 abnormality.
