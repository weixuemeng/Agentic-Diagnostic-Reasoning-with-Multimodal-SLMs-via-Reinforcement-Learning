                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and fever, question tuberculosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and show a right upper lobe opacity.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.
 Mild opacification is noted also in the left apex.  Sutures are noted in the
 left apex.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right upper lobe and to a lesser extent left apical opacity could be related
 to multifocal pneumonia.  This appearance can be seen in tuberculosis.
