  Faint opacity projecting over the right lower lobe may reflect mild dependent
  atelectasis on CT of the abdomen and pelvis ___, however a lateral
  radiograph would be necessary for confirmation.  The remaining lung fields are
  clear.  The heart is not enlarged.  The mediastinal hilar contours are normal.
  There is no large pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.  Enteric tube
  terminates in the stomach.  If patient continues to have no respiratory
  symptoms this may be followed up in several days with formal frontal and
  lateral radiographs of the chest.

 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heterogeneous consolidation in right lower lobe is new from
 previous chest radiograph, but is slightly improved since more recent
 abdominal radiograph from earlier the same date.  Given rapid improvement and
 absence of infectious symptoms, this could represent an acute aspiration
 event.  Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to exclude developing
 infectious consolidation.
