                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with c. diff and elevated WBC  // opacities in
 lungs on previous CXR      opacities in lungs on previous CXR
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with an outside study of ___, there are not better lung
 volumes.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no
 evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  There may be a small
 amount of opacification behind the heart to the right of the spine.  This
 could represent some atelectatic changes, with consolidation much less likely.
 Nevertheless, in the appropriate clinical setting it would be difficult to
 unequivocally exclude the possibility of superimposed pneumonia.
