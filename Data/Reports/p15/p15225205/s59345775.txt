                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and shortness of breath appear
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a
 nodular focus projecting over the left lower lung suggesting a nipple shadow.
 Otherwise, the lung fields appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Nodular focus at the base of the left chest, which is probably due to a
 nipple shadow. However, repeat PA view without on with nipple markers is
 suggested in order to confirm.
 
 An email regarding the follow-up recommendation was sent to the ED QA nursing
 group.
