                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Generalized weakness with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Right-sided
 VP shunt is again seen, coursing over the right hemithorax.  Lung volumes
 remain low and there is minimal interstitial edema, slightly improved as
 compared to the prior study.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in technique and patient
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes again seen.  Mild interstitial edema, improved
 since the prior.
