                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with new neurological findings and anemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well inflated with no obvious consolidation; however,
 there is a suggestion of peribronchial opacification in the retrocardiac left
 lower lobe.  Left anterior oblique chest radiograph is recommended to better
 image this area.  A small round opacity in the right mid field is a vessel on
 end or calcified granuloma.  The lungs are otherwise clear and there is no
 pleural abnormality.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible retrocardiac lung lesion would be better evaluated on a
 left anterior oblique chest radiograph.  Otherwise normal study.
