 INDICATION:    ___M with cough, dyspnea  // Evaluate for pneumonia, vascular
 congestion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are again noted.  There bilateral pleural effusions, left
 greater than right but not dramatically changed from prior.  There is likely
 adjacent atelectasis although more confluent right perihilar and basilar
 consolidation is worse compared to prior.  Degree of pulmonary edema is
 similar compared to prior.  Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess given
 silhouetting bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, and pulmonary
 edema.
 More dense right perihilar and lower lung consolidation worrisome for
 superimposed infection.
