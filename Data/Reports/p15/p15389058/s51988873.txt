 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 New right transjugular dialysis catheter ends in the right atrium.  It is
 difficult to exclude small right pneumothorax but I think the questionable
 contour is a skin fold, similar to the one on the left.  Nevertheless I would

 pleural air.
 
 Large bilateral pleural effusions developed between ___ and ___,
 worsened on ___, stable subsequently.  Mild pulmonary edema is
