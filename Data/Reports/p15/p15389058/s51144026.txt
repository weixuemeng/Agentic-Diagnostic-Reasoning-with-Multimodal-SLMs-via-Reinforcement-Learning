                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion  // r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Mild bibasilar and left retrocardiac airspace opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis.  There is no lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax,
 or pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  No acute
 displaced rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and bibasilar airspace opacities which likely reflect
 atelectasis, although superimposed infection is difficult to exclude.
