                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia, overall clinically improved but
 with increasing plt count  // eval for pleural effusion, evidence of
 cavitation or abscess formation     eval for pleural effusion, evidence of
 cavitation or abscess
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___ an, there is little change in the area
 of opacification in the right mid to upper lung.  Again this is consistent
 with pneumonia.  Although there are no definite areas of cavitation on plain
 radiographs, CT is far more sophisticated for this process.
 There is no evidence of pleural effusion or vascular congestion.
