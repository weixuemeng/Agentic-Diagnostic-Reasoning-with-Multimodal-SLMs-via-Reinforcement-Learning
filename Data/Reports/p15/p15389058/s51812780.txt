                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with acute respiratory failure  // Eval for acute
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right sided dual lumen central venous catheter tip terminates in the right
 atrium, unchanged.  Heart size appears at least moderately enlarged, though
 difficult to completely assess given the presence of moderate-sized bilateral
 pleural effusions, not substantially changed in the interval.  Worsening
 moderate pulmonary edema is present.  More focal opacities the lung bases may
 reflect compressive atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening moderate pulmonary edema with persistent moderate size bilateral
 pleural effusions and compressive bibasilar atelectasis.
