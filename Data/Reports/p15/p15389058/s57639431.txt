 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  Worsening perihilar
 opacities are noted, more so on the right, with increased ill-defined nodular
 opacities within the right lung diffusely.  Persistent consolidative opacity
 in the left lower lobe is again noted along with small bilateral pleural
 effusions which are not substantially changed in size in the interval.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is worse compared to the prior study.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening multifocal pneumonia and persistent small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, also worse in the interval.
