                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left arm tingling.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  The pulmonary interstitium is
 mildly prominent, particularly involving the lower lungs, most suggestive of
 mild fluid overload.  There is no discrete focal opacity, however.  Fissures
 are mildly thickened.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Very small anterior osteophytes
 are noted along the thoracic spine.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial prominence suggestive of slight fluid overload.
