                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain after ribs were squeezed when being
 lifted from a chair. Chronic cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT abdomen and pelvis ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears mildly enlarged, unchanged.  The aorta is slightly tortuous
 but similar.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Increased interstitial
 opacities are noted diffusely, as seen previously, which may be due to mild
 pulmonary edema, but an atypical infection is not excluded.  Blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle suggests a trace pleural effusion.  No focal
 consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Right
 axillary clips and left breasts clips are again noted.  Diffuse osseous
 metastatic disease is again noted, better assessed on prior CT.  Fractures of
 the left second through fifth lateral ribs appear to be chronic with callus
 formation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Diffuse osseous metastatic disease, with subacute appearing left lateral
 second through fifth rib fractures.
 2. Increased interstitial opacities diffusely, as seen previously, which may
 reflect mild interstitial pulmonary edema, but an atypical infection is not
 excluded.
