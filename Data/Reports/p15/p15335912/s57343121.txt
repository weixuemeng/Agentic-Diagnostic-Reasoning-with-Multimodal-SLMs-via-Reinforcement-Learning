                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with altered mental status.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are reduced. Compared to the most recent exam, there
 is increased patchy opacity in the right lower lobe, best seen on the frontal
 views. Left basilar atelectasis is also noted. Due to the patient's kyphosis
 and scoliosis, the lateral views are very limited.  Heart size is mildly
 enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no edema,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe patchy opacity may reflect atelectasis, but
 pneumonia is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
