                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  The chest is hyperinflated.  Streaky right basilar opacity
 suggests minor atelectasis or scarring, not significantly changed aside from
 mild shifting in morphology.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.  Findings
 suggesting obstructive pulmonary disease.
