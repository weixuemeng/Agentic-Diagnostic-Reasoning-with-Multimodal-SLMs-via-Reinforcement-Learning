                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  The aortic arch is again partly calcified.  The lungs
 appear hyperinflated.  Streaky right basilar opacity appears unchanged and
 suggests atelectasis or scarring.  There is small oval calcification
 projecting immediately to the right side along the right cardiac border,
 unchanged but potentially a granuloma or overlying bony structure of doubtful
 significance.  There is no definite pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.  Mild degenerative changes are similar throughout the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting obstructive pulmonary disease.  No evidence
 of pneumonia.
