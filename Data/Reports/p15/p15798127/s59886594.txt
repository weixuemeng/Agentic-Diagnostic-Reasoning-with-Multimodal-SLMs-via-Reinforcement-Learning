                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAM:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with shortness of breath, leg
 swelling, diminished breath sounds on left base.  Evaluate for infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is normal and no
 configurational abnormality is identified.  Thoracic aorta of normal dimension
 and only mildly elongated.  No local contour abnormalities are identified. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There exists, however, an
 irregular peripheral vascular distribution coinciding with hyperinflation of
 mostly the basal lung portions with low positioned and flattened diaphragms. 
 Some linear basal densities are identified and consistent with peripheral
 atelectasis but there is no evidence of any new acute parenchymal infiltrates
 anywhere in the lungs when comparison is made with the preceding examination.
 
 Findings are consistent with rather advanced COPD, emphysema, but there is no
 evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or acute infiltrates.  The heart
 size is well within normal limits in this elderly female patient.  No
 pneumothorax is identified in the apical area and the skeletal structures are
 remarkably well preserved with no evidence of vertebral body compression and
 the kyphotic curvature of the thoracic spine is only mildly accentuated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute new pulmonary or cardiovascular abnormalities.
