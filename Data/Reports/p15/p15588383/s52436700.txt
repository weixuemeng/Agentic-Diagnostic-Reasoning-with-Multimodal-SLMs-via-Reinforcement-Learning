 1.  There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary and interstitial edema.  The patient
 is markedly rotated to the left, limiting evaluation of the cardiac and

 retrocardiac area is difficult to assess and is obscured by the heart due to
 patient rotation.  Lung volumes are relatively low.  No pneumothorax.
