                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at 13:40 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The bones are markedly dense, which is consistent with known metastatic
 prostate cancer in this patient also with acute renal failure.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  The hila are somewhat prominent, which may
 represent prominent pulmonary vessels, although lymphadenopathy cannot be
 entirely excluded.  There is a subtle perihilar opacity in the left upper
 lobe.  This could represent an early pneumonia or aspiration.  No other focal
 airspace consolidation can be appreciated.  No pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.
