                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Indwelling devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable in appearance allowing for positional differences.  Pulmonary edema
 has slightly worsened in the interval and is accompanied by bilateral
 partially layering moderate-sized pleural effusions.  Widespread sclerotic
 metastases are consistent with known prostate cancer.
