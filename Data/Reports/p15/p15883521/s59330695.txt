                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute renal failure, metastatic prostate cancer, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  Mild eventration of the right hemidiaphragm and mild elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragm noted.  The heart is not enlarged.  The aorta is calcified
 and slightly tortuous.  No CHF, frank consolidation, or gross effusion is
 identified.  There is some patchy density at left base, with increased density
 superimposed over the spine on the lateral view, which could reflect an early
 infiltrate.  There is minimal atelectasis at the right base.  Mild
 degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted. No obvious focal lytic
 or sclerotic lesion is detected. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Patchy density at left base, with increased density superimposed
 over the spine on the lateral view, which could reflect an early infiltrate.
