                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic prostate cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal
 limits.  There is mild prominence of interstitial markings that could reflect
 chronic lung disease.  No definite vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or
 acute focal pneumonia on this single image.
 
 No definite evidence of metastatic disease, though radionuclide bone scanning
 would be necessary for this purpose.  Degenerative changes are seen in the
 right shoulder.
