                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 11:38
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with metastatic disease, placement of a
 nasogastric tube.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 17:44.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 11:38 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube with its tip projecting over the
 stomach.  There are diffuse bony metastases.  There is bilateral patchy
 airspace process with probable associated pleural effusions, right greater
 than left, which is likely not significantly changed given differences in
 technique between studies.  The left costophrenic angle is not entirely
 included on this film.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient
 positioning.
