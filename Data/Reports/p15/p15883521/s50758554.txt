                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.  History of metastatic prostate cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest show no focal airspace
 consolidation.  The lung volumes are low in comparison to the prior exam. 
 There is increased interstitial prominence, which is likely due to low lung
 volumes.  There is no definite pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac size is mildly enlarged, unchanged from the prior
 exam.  The mediastinal contours are stable.  There is a sclerotic lesion in
 the right humerus.  The remainder of the bones are markedly dense and
 irregular, which is consistent with the patient's history of known metastatic
 prostate cancer.  Degenerative changes are noted in the right glenohumeral
 joint.  No fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.
 3.  Diffuse osseous metastases.
