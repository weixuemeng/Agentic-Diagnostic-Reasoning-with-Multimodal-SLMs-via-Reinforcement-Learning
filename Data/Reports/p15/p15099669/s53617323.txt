 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with esophageal cancer, now tracheo-esophageal
 fistula  // NG tube, lung volumes
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring and support devices are
 in constant position, including the esophageal stent.  The amount of free
 intra-abdominal air has decreased. Also slightly decreased is the extent of
 the right pleural effusion and the signs indicative of fluid overload. Both
 lung bases are better ventilated than on the previous image. Unchanged remnant
 areas of atelectasis, symmetrical in distribution. Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists. No evidence of pneumothorax.
