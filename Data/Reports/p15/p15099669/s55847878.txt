                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with TE fistula. s/p esophageal and right main
 stent  // eval post op change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles. The esophageal
 stent remains in place. Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned.  The small
 right pleural effusion has increased.  Stable left retrocardiac airspace
 opacification is most likely due to atelectasis.  Increased cysts right mid to
 lower lung airspace opacification is most likely due to aspiration. Mild
 pulmonary edema is new. A bandlike opacity in the left the mid lung is most
 likely due to linear atelectasis. There has been interval placement of a right
 main bronchus stent, which is faintly visible adjacent to the upper two
 sternotomy wires.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New mild pulmonary edema within increased small to moderate right pleural
 effusion.
 New right lung aspiration.
