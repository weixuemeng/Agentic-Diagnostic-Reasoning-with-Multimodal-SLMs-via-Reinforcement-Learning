                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ON ___ AT 10:21
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with known esophageal adenocarcinoma, now
 status post laparoscopic esophagectomy.  Assess for changes in the right lower
 lobe.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 5:03.
 
 PA and lateral view of the chest ___ at 10:21 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the nasogastric tube.  The right chest tube remains in
 place.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in this patient
 status post median sternotomy for CABG and recent laparoscopic esophagectomy. 
 There is more focal elliptical opacity in the right mid lung likely
 representing loculated fluid within the horizontal fissure.  There is a stable
 loculated right pleural effusion and a smaller layering left effusion.  Patchy
 opacities at both lung bases are again seen but there is slightly improved
 overall aeration due to improved inspiration.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 No pneumothorax is appreciated.
