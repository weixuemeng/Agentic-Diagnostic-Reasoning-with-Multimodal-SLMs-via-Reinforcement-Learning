                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Again seen is linear density projecting over the right heart
 silhouette in the region of the neo esophagus air column, of uncertain
 etiology or significance --?  Vascular calcification, surgical material, or
 residual oral contrast, for example, in the neo esophagus.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with TE fistula now s/p airway stenting  // stent
 placement (R mainstem bronchus), ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Several prior chest x-ray is not targeted review of most recent
 chest CT, most recently, a chest x-ray from ___ at 09:04
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a faint tubular density approximately 2.6 cm in length, projecting
 over the expected course of the right mainstem bronchus. This would be
 compatible with a right mainstem bronchus stent, best correlated with details
 of the procedure.
 
 Again seen is patchy opacity of both lung bases, slightly increased at the
 base of the right cardiophrenic region. No pneumothorax is detected. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged allowing for technical differences.
 Again seen is linear density projecting over the right heart silhouette, of
 uncertain etiology or significance --?  Vascular calcification, surgical
 material, or residual oral contrast, for example, in the neo esophagus. No new
 focal infiltrate is identified. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle is unchanged. Oral contrast again noted in the bowel.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Stent visualized over right mainstem bronchus. No pneumothorax or
 pneumomediastinum detected.
 2. Bibasilar patchy opacities, possibly minimally worst in the right
 cardiophrenic region.
