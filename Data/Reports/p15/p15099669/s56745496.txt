 As compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring and support devices are
 constant. The extent of intra-abdominal air has further decreased. However,
 there is a minimal increase in extent of the pre-existing right basal
 parenchymal opacities, likely atelectatic in origin. The retrocardiac
 atelectasis is unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  No visible
 pneumothorax.
