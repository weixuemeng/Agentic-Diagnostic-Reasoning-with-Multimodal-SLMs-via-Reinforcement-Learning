 HISTORY:  Status post transbronchial biopsy on the right.  Question
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post transbronchial biopsy.  An area of
 subpleural thickening projecting over the right upper lateral hemithorax
 appears to have resolved, which may be due to disappearance of a focal
 loculated fluid collection.  There is no definite pneumothorax.  There has
 been no other significant change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence for pneumothorax.  Decreased focal lenticular
 thickening at the right lateral lung apex, otherwise unchanged.
