                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 9:14
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post VATS, status post chest tube
 removal, assess for pneumothorax for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 17:12.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 9:14 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There is a persistent but likely slightly smaller apicolateral
 pneumothorax.  Slight interval improvement in aeration at the left lung base
 with residual streaky opacities likely reflecting subsegmental atelectasis.
 There is right pleural effusion with associated opacity which is essentially
 unchanged and likely reflects partial lower lobe atelectasis.  Status post
 median sternotomy with stable cardiac and mediastinal postoperative contours. 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Subcutaneous emphysema is seen in the right
 lower thoracic and abdominal soft tissues.
