                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with gastric conduit ischemia.  Evaluate for
 pneumomediastinum, status post EGD.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ through
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates stable-appearing
 partially loculated moderate-sized right pleural effusion with adjacent right
 lower lobe and right middle lobe atelectasis.  This is an unusually persistent
 post-operative fluid collection with a partial fissural component.  Stable
 rightward shift of the mediastinum. Initially, there was concern over a linear
 lucency at the right superior mediastinum, but despite initial impression, it
 is ultimately felt that this does not represent pneumomediastinum.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Patient is
 status post CABG with median sternotomy wires in place.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No evidence of pneumomediastinum.
 
 2.  Unusually persistent post-operative fluid collection with partial fissural
 component.
 
 COMMENTS: Finding number one was discussed with Dr.___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 5:44pm on ___, 2 hours after discovery.
