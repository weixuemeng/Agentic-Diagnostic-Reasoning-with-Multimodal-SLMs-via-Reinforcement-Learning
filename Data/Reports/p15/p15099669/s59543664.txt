 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 448 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 448 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube remains unchanged in position in this patient status post
 esophagogastrectomy.  There is stable post-operative appearance to the cardiac
 and mediastinal contours in this patient who is also status post median
 sternotomy for CABG.  A right chest tube remains in place.  Overall there is
 no change in appearance of the right hemithorax, but there is likely a small
 basilar and apical pneumothorax.  There is also a lobulated appearance to the
 right lateral pleura which may represent areas of loculated fluid or
 hemorrhage.  There is a stable left effusion with associated patchy
 retrocardiac opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although
 pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  An elliptical opacity in the right mid lung likely reflects loculated
 fluid within the horizontal fissure which is unchanged in appearance.
