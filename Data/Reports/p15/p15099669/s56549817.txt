                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man status post esophagectomy in ___, now with right
 mainstem bronchial stent covering fistula tract to neoesophagus, evaluate for
 migration of bronchial stent, aspiration pna.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 
 There is increased right lung base opacity, likely due to lobar collapse with
 increased overlying pleural effusion. There is mild pulmonary edema,
 especially prominent on the left. Postoperative neoesophagus is
 stable-appearing.  There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Right
 mainstem bronchial stent is approximately 1.4 cm from the carina and may
 possibly occlude the upper lobe take-off. The stent was previously 2.6 cm
 below the carina and likely in the bronchus intermedius.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Right lower lobe collapse and increase in right pleural effusion.
 2. Slight proximal migration of bronchial stent, now in right mainstem
 bronchus approximately 1.4 cm from the carina.
