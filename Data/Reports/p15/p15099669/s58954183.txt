                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p bronch and J tube placement  // please assess
 for interval changes
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable Chest radiograph, frontal view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ 10:32
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 4.5 cm above the carina.  Esophageal stent is intact. 
 Sternotomy wires are intact. Mediastinal surgical clips are again noted. 
 There is pneumoperitoneum, which is probably explained by recent J-tube
 placement.  There is increased opacity in the left lung, which could be due to
 increased pulmonary edema. Right lower lobe opacity is probably due to
 atelectasis and appears similar to 4hr prior.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 small, larger on the right. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is
 borderline enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity in the left lung could be due to increased pulmonary edema.
 There is pneumoperitoneum, which is probably explained by recent J-tube
 placement.
