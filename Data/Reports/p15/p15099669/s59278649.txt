                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post esophagectomy with controlled leak.
 
 CHEST AP
 
 There has been no significant change since the prior chest x-ray of ___.  Left pleural effusion with fluid extending into the greater and lesser
 fissures is again noted.  The tip of the left PICC line is poorly seen, but is
 thought to probably lie in the region of the cavoatrial junction rather than
 lower.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No change.
