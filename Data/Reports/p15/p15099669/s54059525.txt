                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post right VATS, now with chest tube
 removal, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post removal of a right chest tube with some air within the
 subcutaneous tissues consistent with subcutaneous emphysema.  There has been
 interval appearance of a small right apicolateral pneumothorax.  Followup
 imaging would be recommended to assess for stability.  There is patchy opacity
 at both lung bases most consistent with partial lower lobe atelectasis,
 although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is no pulmonary
 edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable status post
 median sternotomy. Distended stomach with large air-fluid level best
 appreciated on the lateral projection.  There are likely small bilateral
 effusions.  Results of this examination were communicated to the patient's
 nurse, ___, by phone on ___ at 3:14 p.m. at the time of discovery.
