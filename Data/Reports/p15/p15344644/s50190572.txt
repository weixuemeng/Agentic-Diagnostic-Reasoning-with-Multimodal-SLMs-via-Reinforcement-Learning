                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ped strike  // r/o trauma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 4.7 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube courses
 below the diaphragm, out of the field of view.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There
 is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The superior mediastinum is
 prominent, which may be due to combination of low lung volumes and AP, supine
 portable technique.  However, if there is clinical concern for acute
 mediastinal process, consider chest CT for further assessment.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged, likely artifactually accentuated.
 No displaced fracture is seen.
