                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Small pneumothorax persists in the right apical region.  There are low lung
 volumes which accentuate the prominence of the transverse diameter of the
 heart.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again seen with effusion and
 atelectasis at the right base.  Less prominent atelectasis and possible
 effusion on the left.
