                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with palpitations.  Evaluate for evidence of
 acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  An ill-defined band of opacity along
 the right lung base without correlate in the lateral veiw may represent
 atelectasis versus summation of tissues.  Otherwise, no other focal opacities
 are seen.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill defined opacity in the right base is more likely atelectasis
 or summation of tissue.  Otherwise, unremarkable chest radiographic
 examination.
