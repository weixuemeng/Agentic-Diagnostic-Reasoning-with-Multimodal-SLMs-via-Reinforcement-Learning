                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ mesenteric ischemia now s/p aspiration event  // ?
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs between ___ and ___ at 04:20
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are patchy ill-defined opacities in the right hemithorax, which were
 largely seen on the prior CXR.  However, the right lung base opacity has
 worsened over the past 5 hours.  These findings are compatible with multifocal
 pneumonia. Left layering pleural effusion appears to have improved, but this
 may partially be due to change in positioning.  No pneumothorax.  Mediastinum
 appears wide, but is stable.  Heart size is top normal. No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 The endotracheal tube, right PICC line, enteric tube are unchanged in
 position. Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased multifocal ill-defined opacities in right hemithorax, this is
 concerning for worsening multifocal pneumonia.
 2.  Left pleural effusion appears to have improved, though this may partially
 be due to positioning.
