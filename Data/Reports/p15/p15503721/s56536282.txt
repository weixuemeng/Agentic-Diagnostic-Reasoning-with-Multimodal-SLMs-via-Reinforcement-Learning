                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old female newly dx afib with SMV/PV/splenic vein
 thrombosis s/p exlap (___) and resection ___ cm ischemic bowel now tachycardic 
 tachypneic.  // PNA vs. pulmonary edema vs. PE
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___ at 22:29
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are no significant interval changes since the prior radiograph performed
 approximately 12 hours ago.  The right internal jugular catheter terminates in
 the mid SVC.
 
 There are bibasilar opacities, which are likely due to small pleural effusions
 as well as adjacent atelectasis.  However, cannot exclude underlying pneumonia
 in these areas in the appropriate clinical setting.  No pneumothorax or
 pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Persistent bibasilar opacities, due to bilateral pleural effusions with
 adjacent atelectasis. However cannot exclude underlying pneumonia.  Correlate
 clinically with signs of infection.
 2. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
