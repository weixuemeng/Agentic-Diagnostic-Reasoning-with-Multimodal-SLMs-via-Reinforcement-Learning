                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with GI bleeding, hypotension  // Assess tube placement post
 intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Whole chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable supine chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes.  An
 endotracheal tube, its tip which terminates 4 mm above the level of the carina
 in appropriate position.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or
 pulmonary edema.  Heart size is exaggerated secondary to the lung volumes. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is likely sequela of atelectasis. 
 There is mild bronchovascular crowding.  No air under the right hemidiaphragm
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube.
