                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with a history of COPD,
 presenting with wheezing and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates moderately well-aerated lungs
 with a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Streaky opacities in the
 bilateral lung bases are most compatible with atelectasis, with slightly
 better aeration of the left lower lung compared to chest radiograph in the day
 prior.  There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable, other than surgical clips projecting over the mid abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
