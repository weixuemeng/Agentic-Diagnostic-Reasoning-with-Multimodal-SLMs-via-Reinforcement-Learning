                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  THE REPORT OF THIS STUDY WAS ELECTRONICALLY TRANSCRIBED IN ERROR. 
 IT SHOULD HAVE STATED "NEW ENLARGEMENT OF THE CARDIAC SILHOUETTE DUE TO
 CARDIOMEGALY AND/OR PERICARDIAL EFFUSION," NOT "NO ENLARGEMENT"

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ DM1, HTN, CAD s/p CABG, ESRD s/p LRRT s/p pancreas after
 kidney transplant ___ c/b kidney transplant failure (HD dependent MWF) s/p
 for LURT  // now febrile r/o infectious etiology     now febrile r/o
 infectious etiology
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 No enlargement of the cardiac silhouette due to cardiomegaly and/or
 pericardial effusion, accompanied by vascular congestion and basal predominant
 edema suggest cardiac decompensation.  Opacification at the lung bases
 medially could be a combination of dependent edema and atelectasis but
 pneumonia is not excluded.
 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 Right jugular dialysis catheter ends in the right atrium.  Esophageal drainage
 tube passes below the diaphragm and follows an unusual course has suggesting
 displacement of the stomach.  If there is any concern about malposition of
 this tube, abdominal radiographs should be obtained.
