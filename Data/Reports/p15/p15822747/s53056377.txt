                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible SBO, new NG tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 An NG tube is present.  The tip is not well delineated, but extends beneath
 the diaphragm.  The exact location of the tip and of any side port is not
 conclusively determined on this study.  If clinically indicated, an additional
 study with increased penetration centered at the diaphragm may help to better
 delineate the NG tube tip.  
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen is hyperinflation
 consistent with COPD.  Borderline heart size.  Upper zone re-distribution
 without CHF, and minimal atelectasis at the lung bases.  Right costophrenic
 angle is excluded from this film.  No free air is seen beneath the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:  NG tube tip extends beneath the diaphragm, though not fully
 delineated.  Please see comment above.
