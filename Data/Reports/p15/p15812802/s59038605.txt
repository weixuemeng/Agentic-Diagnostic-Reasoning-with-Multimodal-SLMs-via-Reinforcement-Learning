                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with low-grade fevers and rash.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Subtle relatively linear left lower lobe opacities are seen and
 although this is not a focal consolidation and are not obviously apparent on
 the lateral view, an early pneumonia should be considered given the history. 
 Increased vascularity in the right lower lobe is stable compared to the prior
 exam.  Cardiac size and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Possible early pneumonia in the left lower lobe.
