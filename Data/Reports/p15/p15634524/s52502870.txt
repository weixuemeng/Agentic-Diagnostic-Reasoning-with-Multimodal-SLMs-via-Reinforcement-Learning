                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NSTEMI and CHF, increasing SOB  // ?
 worsening pulmonary edema
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph of ___, widespread pulmonary edema has
 resolved with only minimal residual interstitial edema remaining. However, a
 more confluent area of airspace opacification has developed at the right lung
 base, and note is made of minor atelectasis of the left lung base as well as
 small bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable with
 moderate hiatal hernia noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Near resolution of pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  New right lower lobe airspace opacity, which may reflect aspiration or
 developing infectious pneumonia here
