                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT abdomen and pelvis ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperinflated, as evidenced by flattening of the
 diaphragms of the lateral view.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or
 focal airspace consolidation.  Atelectasis at the lung bases is better seen on
 the prior CT.  Nodular opacification in the right upper lobe may represent
 mucous plugging and small airways disease.
 
 8 mm rounded opacification in the left low lung, projecting over the anterior
 left sixth rib, may represent a nipple shadow. The heart is normal size. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Nodular opacities within right upper lobe may represent mucous plugging and
 small airways disease.
 2. 8 mm rounded opacification the left lobe lung may reflect a nipple shadow.
 Followup chest radiographs with and without nipple markers in 8 weeks is
 recommended.
