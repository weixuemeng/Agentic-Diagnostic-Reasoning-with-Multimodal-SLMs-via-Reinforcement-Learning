                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with congestive heart
 failure and severe aortic stenosis as well as atrial fibrillation.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The left pacemaker lead terminates in the expected location of the right
 ventricle.  Cardiomegaly is difficult to assess due to bilateral pleural
 effusions that have increased since the prior study as well as due to
 progression of pulmonary edema, currently severe.  No pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.
