                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single-lead pacemaker terminates in the right ventricle.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There are substantial probably moderate and possibly large
 bilateral pleural effusions with associated basilar opacification, probably
 due to atelectasis and more dense and confluent on the left than right. 
 Aerated lung parenchyma shows interstitial changes suggesting mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting congestive heart failure with substantial
 pleural effusions and basilar opacities, most likely due to atelectasis,
 although not completely specific.
