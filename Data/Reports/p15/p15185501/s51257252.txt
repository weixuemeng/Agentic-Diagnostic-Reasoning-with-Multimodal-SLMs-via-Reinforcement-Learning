                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post central line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a right
 internal jugular central catheter, with the tip terminating in the distal
 SVC/cavoatrial junction. Bibasilar opacities are more prominent compared to
 the chest radiograph in the day prior, likely related to slightly decreased
 lung volumes.  Increased opacity projecting over the left heart border may
 represent lingular consolidation, possibly suggesting aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right internal jugular central catheter, terminating in the distal
 SVC/cavoatrial junction.
 2. Persistent bibasilar opacities, with increased prominence likely related to
 lower lung volumes.  Lingular consolidation is also a consideration, possibly
 in the setting of aspiration.
