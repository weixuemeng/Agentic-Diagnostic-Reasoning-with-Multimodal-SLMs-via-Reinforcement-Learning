                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits without change.
 Lungs are remarkable for similar appearance of biapical scarring with
 associated mild upper lobe volume loss.  No focal areas of consolidation are
 present, and there are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable radiographic appearance of the chest.  No findings to
 suggest pulmonary metastases, but CT would be more sensitive and may be
 considered if clinical suspicion is high.
