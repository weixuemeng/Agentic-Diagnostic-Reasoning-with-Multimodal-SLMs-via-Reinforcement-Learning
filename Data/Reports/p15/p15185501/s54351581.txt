 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous study. Cardiac silhouette size
 is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Severe emphysema
 is re- demonstrated.  There is probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Patchy opacities are again noted in both lung bases, minimally improved
 compared to the previous radiograph.  No new areas of focal consolidation or
 clearly identified. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Scarring
 within the lung apices is symmetric. There are no acute osseous abnormalities
 identified. Several clips are noted within the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent patchy opacities in the lung bases, minimally improved in the
 interval, and remain concerning for pneumonia. Probable mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
