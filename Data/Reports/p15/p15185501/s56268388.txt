                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with post-operative apnea, now intubated  //
 ETT position
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New endotracheal tube in standard placement. Mild dilatation of the trachea at
 the level of the tube suggests over distension of the ETT cuff. Lungs grossly
 clear. Heart size normal.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 Left PIC line ends in the right atrium at a level roughly 5.5 cm below the
 carina and would need to be withdrawn 1.5 cm to reposition it in the low SVC,
 if desired.
 
 Stomach is moderately to severely distended with air and conceivably a
 function of recent intubation.
