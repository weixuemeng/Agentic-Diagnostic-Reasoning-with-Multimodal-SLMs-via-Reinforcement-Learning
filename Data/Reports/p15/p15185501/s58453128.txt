                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with altered mental status  // Is there any
 sign of pneumonia or effusion?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new left
 PICC line. The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the line
 projects over the mid to lower SVC.  No complication, notably no pneumothorax.
 At the left lung bases, in part in the retrocardiac lung areas, a new
 parenchymal opacity is noted. The opacity shows air bronchograms and is
 ill-defined. In the appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia must be suspected.
 No pleural effusions.  New drain in the right upper quadrant.
