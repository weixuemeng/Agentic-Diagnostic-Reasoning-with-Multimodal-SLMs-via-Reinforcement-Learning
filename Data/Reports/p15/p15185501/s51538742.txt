                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Successful repositioning of left PICC, now terminating within the
 lower superior vena cava.  Heart size is normal.  New focus of consolidation
 has developed in the right infrahilar region, predominantly in the right
 middle lobe based upon obscuration of right heart border.  This may represent
 a developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Otherwise, no
 relevant short interval change.
