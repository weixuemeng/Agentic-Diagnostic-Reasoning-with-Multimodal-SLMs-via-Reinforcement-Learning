                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with CP
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  No convincing
 evidence for pneumonia.  A subtle 2.5 x 1.8 cm nodular opacity projecting in
 the left perihilar region not clearly present on prior chest radiograph,
 possibly the result of AP technique.  No signs of edema or congestion.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nodular left perihilar opacity, could represent overlapping structures though
 difficult to exclude a new nodule.  Dedicated PA and lateral views of the
 chest recommended to resolve this finding.
