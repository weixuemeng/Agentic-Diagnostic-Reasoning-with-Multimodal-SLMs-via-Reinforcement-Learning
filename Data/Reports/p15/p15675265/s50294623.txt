                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CAD, AFib, prostate CA status post MCA infarct, intubated, status
 post PEA arrest.  Pleural effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 4:50 a.m.
 
 Rotated positioning.  There is an NG type tube is present, tip extending
 beneath diaphragm off film.  No ET tube is detected on this film.  A right IJ
 central line is present, tip over distal SVC.  
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, with sternotomy wires, but probably
 unchanged.  Prominence of the right pulmonary artery and a tapered appearance
 raises question of some background pulmonary arterial hypertension.  There is
 upper zone redistribution.  There is some focal opacity in the right zone near
 the junction of the right mid and upper zones with apparent volume loss in the
 right upper zone.  There is similar opacity at the right lung apex with
 associated infiltrates and also evidence of retraction.  There is a small
 right effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  There is
 increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation and probable small left effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No ET tube identified.
 
 2.  COPD and cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Small bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 4.  Right greater than left biapical infiltrates, with evidence of retraction
 in the right upper zone, similar to the prior film.
 
 5.  Probable mild CHF, but improved.
