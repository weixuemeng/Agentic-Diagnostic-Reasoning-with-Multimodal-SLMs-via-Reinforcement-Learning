                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with ams  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine frontal image of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  Prominent interstitial markings are seen in the
 lungs with linear right mid lung opacity suggestive of scarring. Overall
 findings may be due to chronic lung disease.   The lungs are clear of
 consolidation worrisome for pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but otherwise
 unremarkable. Median sternotomy wires are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominent interstitial markings in the lungs with more focal linear right mid
 lung, opacity which may all be chronic. Cardiomegaly.
