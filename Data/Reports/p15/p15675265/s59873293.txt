                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with focal bronchiectasis and recurrent
 hemoptysis.  Recently with hemoptysis again, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___
 and ___.  This study is read in conjunction with CTA of the chest
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The lungs are well
 inflated, and there is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax.  The previously seen right perihilar linear opacifications
 persist on this study and may represent scarring.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 again seen, and sternotomy wires are unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No pneumonia, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Persistent right
 perihilar opacification may represent scarring.  If it is clinically justified
 to investigate this area, CT of the thorax with IV contrast is recommended.
