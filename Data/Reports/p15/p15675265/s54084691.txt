                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary edema, question interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 15:39 p.m.
 
 A right IJ central line is present, tip over mid/distal SVC, unchanged.  An
 orogastric-type tube is present, extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  
 
 The lungs show evidence for background COPD.  The patient is status post
 sternotomy. There is moderate cardiomegaly, similar to prior.  There is upper
 zone redistribution and interstitial edema with diffuse vascular blurring,
 consistent with CHF, probably with an element of pulmonary edema.  This has
 progressed significantly compared with the earlier film.  There is a
 small-to-moderate left and probable new small right pleural effusion.  There
 is underlying left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Progression of CHF findings, now with interstitial and probably some
 element of pulmonary edema.
 2.  Small-to-moderate left effusion and left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, similar to prior study.
 3.  Possible small right pleural effusion, new compared with the prior study.
