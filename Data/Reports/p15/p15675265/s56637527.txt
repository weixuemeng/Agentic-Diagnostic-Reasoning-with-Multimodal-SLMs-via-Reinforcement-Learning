                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a stroke.  Suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Pulmonary vascular engorgement has increased, and although there is no
 pulmonary edema, fullness in the confluence of pulmonary veins on the lateral
 view is probably due to left heart failure.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are present.  I see no good evidence for pneumonia, two small opacities
 projecting lateral to the right hilus, at the level of the third anterior
 interspace, could be lung nodules.  Whether investigation with CT scanning is
 appropriate, would depend upon clinical circumstances.
