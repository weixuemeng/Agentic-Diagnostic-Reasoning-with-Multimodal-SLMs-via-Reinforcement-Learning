 bilateral pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Additional left base
 consolidation is not excluded.  Scattered calcified nodules are again seen
 bilaterally suggesting prior granulomatous disease.  The cardiac silhouette is
 not enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis,
 additional left base consolidation not excluded.
