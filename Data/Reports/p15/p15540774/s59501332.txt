                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT ___ HOURS
 
 HISTORY:  Substernal chest pain secondary to exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A calcified nodule is noted projecting adjacent to the right hilum.
 Dense calcified foci also project within the right hilar structures
 themselves.  There are linear reticular lines radiating from both apical
 regions, more noticeable on the right with slight upward traction of bilateral
 hila.  No consolidation or edema is evident.  The mediastinum is otherwise
 unremarkable.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal for size.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax is noted.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Fibrotic changes of both lung apices as well as the calcified
 nodules and lymph nodes likely indicate prior granulomatous infection,
 possibly tuberculosis.  Correlate clinically with history.
