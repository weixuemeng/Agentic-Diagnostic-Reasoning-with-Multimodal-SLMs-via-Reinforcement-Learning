 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Persistent right superior shoulder pain, rib pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no comparison available at the time of dictation.  Normal
 lung volumes.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No focal parenchymal
 opacity suggesting pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions.  No
 evidence of pathologic changes in the region of the right shoulder or the
 right ribs.  However, if the clinical presentation persists, addition of the
 dedicated rib series would be recommended.
