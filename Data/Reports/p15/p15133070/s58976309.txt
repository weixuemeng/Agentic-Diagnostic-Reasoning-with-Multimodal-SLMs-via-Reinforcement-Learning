                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of pulmonary hypertension with left pleural effusion noted 2
 weeks ago, evaluate for interval change.  
 
 COMPARISON:  All available chest x-rays from ___ through ___.  CT chest ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest show central prominence of pulmonary
 artery contour, consistent with provided history of pulmonary artery
 hypertension.  There has been improvement of a left pleural effusion, which is
 now nearly resolved.  Again noted, is a peripheral left lower lobe
 opacification which has slightly improved compared to ___.  The
 cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Pleural
 surfaces are normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left pleural effusion has decreased in size.
 
 2.  Slight improvement of nonspecific left lower lobe peripheral opacity,
 which in the setting of history of  pulmonary emboli, may represent pulmonary
 infarct.  Continued chest x-ray followup is suggested in 4 weeks to assess for
 resolution.
