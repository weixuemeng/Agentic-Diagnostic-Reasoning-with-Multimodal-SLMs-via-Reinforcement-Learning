                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multiple PEs, hypoxia.  // Pulmonary
 edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ CTA chest
 ___ PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is new dense consolidation of the left lower lobe.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are probably unchanged.  A lateral left lower lobe pulmonary
 nodule is unchanged, better evaluated on recent CT.  Heart size is normal. 
 Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are normal.  No pulmonary edema. 
 Incidental note is made of a radiopaque density projecting over the proximal
 left humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Left lower lobe pneumonia or atelectasis.
 2. Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule is again noted.
 3. A radiodensity projects over the proximal left humerus.  Dedicated humerus
 radiographs could be considered to definitively identify an osseous lesion. 
 Alternatively, a nonurgent bone scan could be considered to evaluate for
 additional osseous lesions.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  A radiodensity projects over the proximal left humerus.
 Dedicated humerus radiographs could be considered to definitively identify an
 osseous lesion.  Alternatively, a nonurgent bone scan could be considered to
 evaluate for additional osseous lesions.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 12:00 PM, approximately
