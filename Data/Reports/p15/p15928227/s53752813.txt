                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with bilateral lower extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low with bibasilar atelectasis.  The visualized
 aerated portions of lungs demonstrate no evidence for focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Heart size is top normal although likely
 exaggerated by low lung volumes.  There is no evidence for pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis without otherwise
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
