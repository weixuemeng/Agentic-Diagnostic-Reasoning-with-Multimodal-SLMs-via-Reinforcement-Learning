                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hemoptysis today, prior episode two weeks ago
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Rim calcified convexity at the AP window is concerning
 for a pseudoaneurysm.  The aorta is otherwise diffusely calcified.  Hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Vascular indistinctness with perihilar haziness
 suggests mild pulmonary edema.  Additional ill-defined nodular opacities are
 noted within the right lung, which could reflect infection or aspiration.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No acute
 osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Abnormal left mediastinal contour with rim calcified convexity at the AP
 window suggestive of a pseudoaneurysm arising from the aorta.  Further
 assessment with chest CTA is recommended.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema.
 3. Ill-defined nodular opacities within the right lung may reflect multifocal
 pneumonia or aspiration.  This can also be assessed at the time of chest CT.
