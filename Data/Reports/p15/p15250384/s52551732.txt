  There has been interval placement of a double-lumen ET tube, terminating the
  left main stem bronchus.  Diffuse nodular interstitial opacities are
  identified in bilateral lungs.  The rim calcified aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm at
  the descending aorta is unchanged and was better evaluated on prior CTA.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hemoptysis, s/p endotracheal intubation with
 double lumen ETT.  // Evaluate ETT position.     Evaluate ETT position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, this and placement of a double-lumen
 endotracheal tube, terminating in the left mainstem bronchus.  Little change
 in the diffuse bilateral nodular and interstitial opacities.  The rim
 -calcified aneurysm/ pseudoaneurysm of the descending aorta is unchanged and
 better identified on the prior CTA.
