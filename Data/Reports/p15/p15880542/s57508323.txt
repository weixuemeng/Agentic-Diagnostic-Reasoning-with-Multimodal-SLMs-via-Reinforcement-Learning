                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  22 weeks and 6 days pregnant presenting with fever and
 desaturations.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  Heterogeneous,
 left greater than right bibasilar consolidations are present with a
 particularly large area of consolidation in the left lower lung which
 silhouettes the left hemidiaphragm.  There is a small left pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left greater than right bibasilar consolidations worrisome for infection.  The
 particularly large area of consolidation in the left lower lung is suggestive
 of aspiration or an atypical etiology such as Legionella or Mycoplasma.
