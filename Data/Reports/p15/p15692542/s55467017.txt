                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:49 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with crackles after fluid administration.  Question
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lungs are clear of consolidation or pulmonary edema. Branching structure in
 the left lower lung is probably vascular, but I would welcome reviewing it on
 conventional chest radiographs to make sure it is not a mucoid impaction. 
 There is no vascular engorgement or pleural effusion and the heart size is
 normal.
