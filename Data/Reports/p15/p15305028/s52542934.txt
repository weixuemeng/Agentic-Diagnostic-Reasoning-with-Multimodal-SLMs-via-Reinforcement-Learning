                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and recent fluid resuscitation.  Question fluid
 overload.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier chest radiographs from the same day and CT performed
 earlier during the same evening.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There is mild-to-moderate relative
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  A mild interstitial abnormality suggests slight
 fluid overload.  Patchy opacity with a shifting distribution lies within the
 right cardiophrenic angle, suggesting persistent minor atelectasis.  The left
 costophrenic sulcus is excluded.  However, there is no definite evidence for
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings which suggest mild fluid overload.
