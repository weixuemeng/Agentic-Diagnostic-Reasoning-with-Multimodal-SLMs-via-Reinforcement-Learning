 As compared to the prior examination, there has been no relevant interval
 change. Again, surgical clips are noted overlying the thoracic inlet at the
 level of the thyroid. There is no evidence of lobar consolidation, large
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Slight obscuration of the left costophrenic
 angle is likely secondary to overlying soft tissue. Descending thoracic aortic
 calcifications are noted. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.

 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
