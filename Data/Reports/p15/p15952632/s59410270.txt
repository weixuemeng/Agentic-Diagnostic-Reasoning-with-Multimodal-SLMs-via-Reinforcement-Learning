                                 FINAL REPORT
 TWO-VIEW CHEST, ___
 
 No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mild-to-moderately enlarged, even allowing
 for accentuation by relatively low lung volumes.  Vascular calcifications are
 seen in the region of the aortic valve and peripherally within the thoracic
 and abdominal aorta.  Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits allowing
 for accentuation by low lung volumes.  Lungs and pleural surfaces are clear. 
 Surgical clips are noted in the upper paratracheal region bilaterally.  Bones
 are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
