                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right chest tube after thoracoabdominal partial nephrectomy on water
 seal, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:55 a.m.
 
 Compared with prior film, the ET tube has been removed.  A right chest tube
 remains present.  Additional tubing overlies the right chest, question outside
 of patient.  A wire-like device may represent an epidural catheter, but should
 be correlated.  Clips noted over the thoracic inlet bilaterally.  
 
 The right apex is considerably obscured by overlying bony structures.  No
 obvious pneumothorax is detected, though subtle pneumothorax might not be
 apparent on these films.  The inspiratory volumes are low.  Atelectasis noted
 at both bases.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam, no definite pneumothorax identified.
