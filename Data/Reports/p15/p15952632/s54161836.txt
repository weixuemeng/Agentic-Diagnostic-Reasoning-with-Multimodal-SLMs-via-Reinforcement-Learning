                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postop day #2 thoracoabdominal partial nephrectomy.  Chest tube
 removed, question pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 15:15 p.m.
 
 Right-sided chest tube has been removed.  No right-sided pneumothorax is
 detected at this time.  Again seen is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 with patchy opacity in right greater than left bases.  There are low
 inspiratory volumes, though better than on the prior film.  There is some more
 diffuse hazy opacity in the right lung compared to the left --  this is of
 uncertain etiology, but could reflect an element of atelectasis.  Bilateral
 surgical clips again noted at the thoracic inlet.Surgical clips also noted in
 the upper abdomen.  
 
 The lateral view is difficult to interpret due to overlying soft tissues.  No
 gross effusions are identified. The bibasilar patchy opacities  seen on the
 frontal view likely relate to opacities in lower lobe/lobes, likely
 representing collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax detected status post removal of the right-sided chest
 tube.
 
 2.  Low, but improved, inspiratory volumes, with continued patchy opacity at
 both bases.
 
 3.  Asymmetric hazy opacity in the right lung, new compared with the prior
 film, is of uncertain etiology, but could reflect an element of atelectasis.
