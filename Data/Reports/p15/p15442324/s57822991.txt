                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF. Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior outside chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph from earlier today, the cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged. Diffuse bilateral opacities could represent
 pulmonary edema, however underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is no
 large pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Surgical clips are seen
 overlying the cardiac silhouette and note is made of sternotomy wires. 
 Widening of the AC joint on the right likely represents a chronic finding.  
  
 
 IMPRESSION: Diffuse bilateral opacities could reflect pulmonary edema, however
 underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
