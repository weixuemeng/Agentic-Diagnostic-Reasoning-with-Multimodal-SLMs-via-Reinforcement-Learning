  1.  Widened mediastinum is nonspecific and can be seen in the setting of
  ascending aortic aneurysm and dissection.  Clinical correlation is recommended
  in comparison with prior imaging would be helpful.
  2. Right middle and right lower lobe opacity with small right pleural effusion
  is worrisome for pneumonia.
  3. Tubular air-filled structure over right mid hemi thorax is most consistent
  with focal bronchiectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new seizures.  Assess for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left lung is well-expanded and clear.  A right middle and right lower lobe
 opacity obscuring the right heart border is seen.  A small right pleural
 effusion is noted.  No left pleural effusion.  A tubular air-filled structure
 projecting over the right mid hemi thorax is most consistent with focal
 atelectasis.  The mediastinum is widened measuring ___.2 cm.  Visualized heart
 is otherwise unremarkable.
