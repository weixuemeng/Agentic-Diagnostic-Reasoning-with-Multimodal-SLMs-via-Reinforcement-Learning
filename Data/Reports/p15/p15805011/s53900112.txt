                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.  Question infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Central
 pulmonary vessels are again mildly prominent but not changed since prior
 studies.  Mild interstitial prominence in the lower lungs including
 peribronchial cuffing suggests chronic airway inflammation that is unchanged
 with no definite superimposed process.  The chest is hyperinflated.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest.  No evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary disease.
