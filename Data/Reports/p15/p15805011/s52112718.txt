                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain with wheezing and rhonchi on physical exam on the
 right greater than the left, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest with the patient
 lying in the stretcher were obtained.  Evaluation of the heart and lungs is
 limited due to technique and patient rotation.  Within these limitations,
 there is blunting of the right costophrenic angle with opacification of the
 right minor fissure suggesting pleural fluid.  No focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia or significant pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size allowing for rotation and low inspiratory lung
 volumes.  The mediastinum is within normal limits.  The visualized upper
 abdomen is gasless.
 
 IMPRESSION: New or increased small right pleural effusion. Lungs clear.
