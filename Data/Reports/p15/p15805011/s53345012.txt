                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are mildly
 underpenetrated due to patient body habitus.  There is persistent elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle seen
 on the frontal view, not substantiated on the lateral view, is most likely due
 to overlying soft tissue.  No large pleural effusion and pneumothorax is seen.
 There is no definite focal consolidation.  The cardiac silhouette appears
 mildly enlarged, likely accentuated by AP technique.  No overt pulmonary edema
 is seen.  Slight prominence of the aortic knob is stable compared to scout
 radiograph from CT from ___.
