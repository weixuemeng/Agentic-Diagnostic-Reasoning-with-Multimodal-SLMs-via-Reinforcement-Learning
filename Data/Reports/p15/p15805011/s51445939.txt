                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.  Evaluate for cardiomegaly or
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent on ___,
 and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  This examination is limited due to underpenetration likely owing to
 patient's body habitus.  Allowing for this limitation, the lungs are well
 expanded, without focal opacities.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Scattered areas
 of pleural thickening are due to extrapleural fat, not clinically significant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normal chest radiographic examination.
