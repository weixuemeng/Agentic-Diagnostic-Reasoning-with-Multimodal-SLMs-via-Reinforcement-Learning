                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___ and CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of chest demonstrate normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  There is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta. 
 The lung volumes are slightly decreased but stable.  There is no pneumothorax,
 vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
 There is a small opacity obscuring the left posterior costophrenic angle,
 which is likely due to a Bochdalek hernia.  Apparent thickening along the left
 lateral basal pleural space is consistent with extrapleural fat as correlated
 with CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bochdalek hernia likely accounts for a small opacity in the left
 posterior lung base.  However, as this appears slightly more prominent than on
 prior studies, suggest a repeat CXR to exclude an adjacent pneumonia if
 symptoms persist.
