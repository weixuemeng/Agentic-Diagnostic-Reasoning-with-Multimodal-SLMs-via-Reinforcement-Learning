                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with altered mental status who is intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semiupright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior relevant imaging is available on PACS at the time of
 this dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina, in standard
 position.  Lung volumes are slightly low.  Bilateral ill-defined as well as
 confluent air space opacities can be seen with infection or heart failure. 
 Retrocardiac opacity with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm may represent
 a combination of effusion and/or atelectasis.  The heart size is difficult to
 assess on this portable exam and since the left heart border is obscured.  The
 central pulmonary vessels appear engorged.  No pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ETT in standard position.
 
 2.  Multifocal pneumonia and/or heart failure, multifocal pneumonia is most
 likely given the history of leukocytosis.
