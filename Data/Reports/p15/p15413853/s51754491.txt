 curvilinear calcification projecting over the right heart raising potential
 concern for an aortic aneurysm. Degenerative changes noted at the right
 shoulder. Fused spine noted.

 1. Limited, no convincing evidence of pneumonia.
 2. Mild cardiomegaly without overt edema.
 3. Aortic atherosclerosis with findings raising concern for thoracic aortic
 aneurysm. Correlation with CT advised.
