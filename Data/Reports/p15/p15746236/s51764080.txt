                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated with recurrent fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable semiupright chest radiograph was obtained.  Endotracheal
 tube, nasogastric tube and right subclavian central venous catheter are in
 unchanged position.  Interval increase in engorgement of the pulmonary
 vasculature and septal thickening is consistent with moderate pulmonary edema
 with new small right greater than left bilateral pleural effusions and
 unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  The heart
 is mildly enlarged with otherwise normal cardiomediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION: Increased now moderate pulmonary edema with new small bilateral
 pleural effusions and unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis.
