                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recurrent fevers, patient intubated.  Subarachnoid
 hemorrhage.
 
 The position of the various support lines and tubes remains unchanged.  The
 left hemidiaphragm is obscured, which suggests the presence of left lower lobe
 atelectasis or pneumonia.  An bronchogram, however, is not seen.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is less prominent, and there is no evidence of edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac density indicating probable atelectasis at the left
 base or possibly pneumonia.
