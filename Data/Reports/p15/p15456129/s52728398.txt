                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness, confusion  // eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest dated ___, chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities, right greater than left, likely reflecting
 patchy atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary
 edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and bibasilar airspace opacities which likely reflect
 atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded.
