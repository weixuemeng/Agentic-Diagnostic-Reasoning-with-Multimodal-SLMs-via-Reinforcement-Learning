                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube in place, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has
 taken a slightly better inspiration.  This probably accounts for the apparent
 improvement in aeration; nevertheless, there is still diffuse bilateral
 pulmonary opacifications with probable loculated effusion on the left.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
