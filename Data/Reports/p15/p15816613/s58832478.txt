 HISTORY:  Ischemic bowel with intubation, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  There is a generalized increase in pulmonary
 opacifications, most likely consistent with developing pulmonary edema. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis with layering effusions persist.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, a supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
