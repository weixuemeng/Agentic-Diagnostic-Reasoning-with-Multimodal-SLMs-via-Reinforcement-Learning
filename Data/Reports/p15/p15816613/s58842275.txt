                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate pleural effusion.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___ chest x-ray and CT.
 
 Large right effusion has increased.  Left loculated effusion is probably
 unchanged, allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.  The patient
 has air in the pleural space, better seen in the concurrent CT.  Left lower
 lung and right middle lobe opacities are better seen in concurrent CT.  Left
 pigtail catheter, right PICC and pacer leads are in unchanged position.
