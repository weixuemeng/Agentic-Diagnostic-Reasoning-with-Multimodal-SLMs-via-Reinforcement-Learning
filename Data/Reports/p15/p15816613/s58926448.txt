 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:38 PM
  Previously noted small left pneumothorax is less apparent on this study,
  suggesting an interval decrease. Left apical opacity persists and appears
  slightly expanded suggestive of re-expansion edema or hemorrhage. Little
  change otherwise in comparison to the prior study from the same day.
