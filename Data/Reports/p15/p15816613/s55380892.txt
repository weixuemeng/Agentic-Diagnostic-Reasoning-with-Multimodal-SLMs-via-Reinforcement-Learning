                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup effusion.  After placement of chest tube
 
 Loculated moderate left effusion is noted. A small area of radiolucency in the
 mid left lung medially likely represents a pneumothorax.  There is a new left
 basal pigtail catheter.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  Pacer leads are in
 standard position.  Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC, large right pleural
 effusion has increased with increasing adjacent opacities.  These opacities
 are likely atelectases but superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded.  There is no right pneumothorax.
