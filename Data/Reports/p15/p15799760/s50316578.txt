                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Preop chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph was obtained.  Stable scarring
 in the right mid to lower lung is noted.  Mild ground-glass opacity in the
 lungs could suggest a component of pulmonary edema or atypical infection.  No
 large pleural effusions are seen.  Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal
 contour is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable scarring in the right mid-to-lower lung.  Vague
 ground-glass opacity, question pulmonary edema or atypical infection.  Please
 correlate clinically.  Recommend dedicated PA and lateral views to further
 assess.
