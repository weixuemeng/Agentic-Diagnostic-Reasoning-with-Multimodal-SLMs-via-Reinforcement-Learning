                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with acute onset CP thisAM.  // assess for edema,
 acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest x-ray from ___ 3
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to ___, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly
 unchanged.  Sternotomy wires again noted.  Heart size is at the upper limits
 of normal, with a mild left ventricular configuration.  The aorta is
 calcified.
 
 No CHF, though mild thickening of the minor fissure is again noted.  No
 pneumothorax or effusion.
 
 There is patchy opacity in the right infrahilar region which is probably
 similar to ___.  Otherwise, no focal infiltrate detected.
 
 No rib fracture identified on these lung technique films.  Note made of
 degenerative changes at the left greater the right acromioclavicular joints.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity in the right infrahilar region is similar to ___ and
 therefore likely represents an area of scarring.  The differential diagnosis
 could include an area of atelectasis or infiltrate, but this is considered
 much less likely given stability over time.  No other infiltrate identified.
 
 No CHF, effusion, or pneumothorax detected.
