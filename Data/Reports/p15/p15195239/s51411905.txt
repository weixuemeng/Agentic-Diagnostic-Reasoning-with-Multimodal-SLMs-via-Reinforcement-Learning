                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with SOB, JVD, and lower extremity edema  // ?pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are pleural based calcifications projecting over the left mid to
 upper lung, thought to represent calcified pleural plaques.  Rounded opacity
 projecting over the right lung apex is slightly more conspicuous on the
 frontal view but appears larger when compared to prior lateral.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear without consolidation, effusion, or edema.  Moderate cardiac
 enlargement is again noted as well as tortuosity of descending thoracic aorta.
 Lower thoracic compression deformity is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 Right apical nodular opacity appears more conspicuous when compared to remote
 prior.  Nonurgent chest CT is suggested to further characterize.
