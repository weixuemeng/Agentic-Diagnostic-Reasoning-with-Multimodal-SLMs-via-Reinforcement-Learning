                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CT removal  // CT removal @18:00 please do
 after 3 hours -> r/u pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac and mediastinal silhouette which is
 moderately enlarged.  There right-sided hydropneumothorax appears decreased as
 compared to the prior study.  Increased right base opacity may in part be due
 to low lung volumes versus worsening right-sided consolidation.  Evidence of
 pneumoperitoneum is re- demonstrated.  Mild left base atelectasis with
 possible pleural effusion.  Right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is noted. 
 Dense contrast is seen in the left splenic flexure.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval decrease in right-sided hydro pneumothorax.  Low lung volumes with
 increase in right mid to lower lung opacity may be due to worsening
 consolidation.  Right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema.
