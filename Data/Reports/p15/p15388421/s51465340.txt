 pulm edema, ptx, pleural effusion, pna, pls perform as close to 5 AM as
 possible
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a slightly
 better inspiration, which most likely is responsible for the slight
 improvement in the opacification at the right base consistent with a
 combination of atelectatic changes and pleural fluid.  Right chest tube
 remains in place and there is no definite pneumothorax.  Left basilar
 opacification is consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left
 lower lobe.
 Otherwise little change.
