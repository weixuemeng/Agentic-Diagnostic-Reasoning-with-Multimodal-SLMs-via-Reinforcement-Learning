                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post esophagectomy complicated by leak. 
 Evaluate for pulmonary edema, atelectasis, pneumonia, and effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Median sternotomy wires appear intact.  A right-sided PICC is again seen and
 likely terminates in the SVC but the tip is relatively obscured.  A
 right-sided chest tube is again seen.  An esophageal drain is in unchanged
 position.  There is stable, moderate cardiomegaly.  The lung volumes are low
 bilaterally.  Decreased left retrocardiac opacity likely reflects improving
 left basilar atelectasis.  Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm likely
 reflects a small, stable left pleural effusion.  Obscuration of the right
 hemidiaphragm likely reflects an increasing small right pleural effusion.
 There is new fluid in the right minor fissure.  Interval increase in opacity
 at the right base is consistent with postoperative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Improving left basilar atelectasis.
 2.  Bilateral, small pleural effusions, increasing on the right.
 3.  Increasing opacity at the right base is consistent with postoperative
 changes.
