                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p esophagectomy with left empyema  // check
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, the neo esophagus appears less
 distended.  Right chest tube has changed in position with apparent slight
 decrease in size of right pleural effusion.  Small right basilar hydro
 pneumothorax on today's study is not clearly seen on the prior exam, possibly
 due to positional differences.  Right basilar atelectasis has decreased in
 extent, but left lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural effusion have
 slightly increased in extent.
