                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, effusions.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 7:35 a.m.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged allowing for technical
 differences.  Again seen is upper zone re-distribution, vascular plethora and
 vascular blurring, consistent with CHF and interstitial edema.  Focal
 opacities in the retrocardiac region and right base medially are again noted,
 similar to the prior film.  Small left effusion is also unchanged.  Minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle and a small amount of right pleural
 fluid are greater than on the prior film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  CHF with interstitial edema and small effusions.  Left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation and patchy opacity at the right base are in
 great part similar to the radiograph from ___.
