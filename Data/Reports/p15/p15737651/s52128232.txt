                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  A ___-year-old female with history of chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen, unchanged in position, with leads
 extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle. 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  Slight prominence of the hila is
 without significant change and may relate to pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 Evidence of DISH is seen along the spine.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with possible minimal central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.
