                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are very low accentuating the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary
 vasculature. Heart size is probably mildly enlarged. Central pulmonary
 vascular engorgement with mild interstitial pulmonary edema as well as small
 bilateral pleural effusions. Left greater than right base consolidations could
 possibly all be atelectatic though pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial edema and trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 2. Left greater than right basal opacities could be atelectatic though
 pneumonia cannot be excluded given the appropriate clinical circumstance.
