                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain status post recent surgery.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is substantial free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.  The
 lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Patchy basilar opacities seen on each side can probably be
 attributed to minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There is
 no definite pleural effusion although small pleural effusions would be
 difficult to exclude, given technique.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate quantity of free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.  
 
 Findings discussed at 6:45 with Dr. ___ by telephone very shortly
 after discovery.
