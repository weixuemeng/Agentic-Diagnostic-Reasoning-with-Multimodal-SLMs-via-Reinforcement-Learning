                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient, status post open sigmoid colectomy
 for colovesicular fistula.  Now status post laparotomy with repair of
 anastomotic leak and diverting loop.  Evaluate for fluid overload or
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made to the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The on previous examination free air under
 the right diaphragm has disappeared and is now replaced by diffuse solid
 density.  As this continues into the right superior-lateral chest wall, it is
 believed that this represents increased pleural effusion.  No new pulmonary
 parenchymal abnormalities can be identified short of the area that is
 concealed by the pleural basal density.  The pulmonary vasculature in this
 area does not suggest overt CHF, and no pneumothorax is seen in the apical
 area.
 
 Patient may be fluid overloaded; however, this has not led to radiographically
 detectable pulmonary edema.
