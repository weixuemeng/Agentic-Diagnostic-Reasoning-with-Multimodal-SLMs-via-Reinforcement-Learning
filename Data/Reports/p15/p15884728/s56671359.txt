                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with a history of CNS lymphoma, on high-dose
 methotrexate, who presents for evaluation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen are biapical peripheral areas of scarring and fibrosis,
 otherwise unchanged compared to the prior exam.  The lungs are well expanded
 and otherwise clear.  There is no evidence of pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  The cardiomediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute abnormalities identified.  Specifically, no evidence of
 pleural effusion seen on the frontal radiograph.
 
 NOTE: Assessment of pleural effusion is limited on single AP radiographs as up
 to 300 cc's of pleural fluid can hide in the posterior pleural space. Would
 recommend lateral view to definitively rule out pleural effusions.
