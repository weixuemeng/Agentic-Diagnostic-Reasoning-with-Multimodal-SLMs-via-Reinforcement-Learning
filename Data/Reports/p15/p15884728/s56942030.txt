                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with central nervous system lymphoma on
 Rituxan, history of TB exposure with cough, questionable infiltrates,
 compatible with TB reactivation.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding single view AP
 projection chest examination of ___.  The on previous examination
 identified linear and partially calcified scattered abnormalities in both
 apical portions remain completely unchanged as can be identified by ordinary
 radiography.  Thus, they most likely represent fibrotic and calcified scars
 after old and now inactive specific infection.  No new parenchymal
 abnormalities identified.  The lateral pleural sinuses are free.  As
 apparently followed our previous recommendations, lateral views were obtained
 and the integrity of both posterior pleural sinuses appears preserved.  Thus,
 there is no evidence of any acute pleural effusion in the pleural spaces.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable bilateral apical scar formations, compatible with old
 specific infection clearly stable during latest examination intervals.
