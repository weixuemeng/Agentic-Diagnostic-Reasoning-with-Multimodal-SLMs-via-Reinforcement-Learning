                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with difficulty blood return from port  // eval
 port placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, the appearance of the left internal
 jugular porta catheter is unchanged. It terminates at the level of the mid
 superior vena cava and there is no evidence of catheter fracture. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Bilateral upper lobe interstitial lung
 disease is unchanged.  Apparent hazy opacity in left lower lung may reflect
 superimposition of soft tissues of the chest wall, but standard PA and lateral
 radiographs would be helpful to exclude a developing infection in this region.
