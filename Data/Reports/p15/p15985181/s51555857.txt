                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.  Opacification in the
 retrocardiac area silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is consistent with some
 combination of pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
