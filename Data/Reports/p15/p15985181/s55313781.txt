                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory insufficiency, status post left brachial artery
 embolectomy, here to evaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 05:17.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the most recent prior study, an endotracheal tube
 is seen terminating at the level of the thoracic inlet.  A nasogastric tube
 extends below the diaphragm with the tip terminating in the left upper
 quadrant, likely within the stomach.  A left internal jugular central venous
 catheter is unchanged in position with the tip terminating at the confluence
 with the SVC.  Areas of airspace opacity are again noted in the right lung
 apex and left lung base, which are gradually worsening over multiple prior
 studies.  No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged position of support devices.
 2.  Gradually worsening multifocal consolidations concerning for pneumonia.
 3.  Mild cardiomegaly.
