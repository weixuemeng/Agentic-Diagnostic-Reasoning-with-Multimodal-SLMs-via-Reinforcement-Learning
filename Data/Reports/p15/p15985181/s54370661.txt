                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with atrial fibrillation found to have
 multifocal pneumonia complicated by pulmonary edema.  Question interval change
 in pulmonary edema and lung opacities.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT dated ___ and radiograph dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a right internal
 jugular approach central venous catheter with tip extending to the
 cavo-brachiocephalic junction.  An enteric tube is in place, extending
 inferiorly out of view.  Since two days ago, there has been significant
 improvement of pulmonary edema, with interval decrease of pleural effusions. 
 There is, however, persistent severe cardiomegaly.  There is persistent
 consolidation in the left lower lobe and confluent opacity in the right upper
 lung, at least in part due to known underlying apical mass lesion with
 calcifications as correlated with prior CT.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Patient is turned slightly to the right.  There is no new acute process.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval improvement of pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.
 
 2.  Persistent cardiomegaly.  While this could represent cardiac
 decompensation, rapid course of development of cardiomegaly raises question of
 a pericardial effusion, which remains to be considered.  
 
 3.  Persistent left lower lobe consolidation and right upper lobe pulmonary
 lesion, better delineated on prior CT dated ___.
 
 Findings reported to Dr. ___ at 11:20 a.m. on ___ via phone by Dr.
 ___.
