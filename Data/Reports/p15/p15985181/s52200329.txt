                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pneumonia and end-stage dementia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal portable radiograph demonstrates a left subclavian
 approach central venous catheter with tip in cavobrachiocephalic junction.  An
 enteric tube traverses inferiorly out of view.  The lung volumes remain low,
 accentuating massive enlargement of cardiac silhouette, which could reflect a
 component of a failure and/or pericardial effusion.  Perivascular congestion
 is mildly improved.  Right upper lung opacity is re-demonstrated, compatible
 with underlying chronic apical mass.  Left lower lobe consolidation is
 re-demonstrated, likely associated with a component of atelectasis.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal interval improvement of vascular congestion.  Persistent
 massive cardiomegaly could reflect cardiac decompensation versus pericardial
 effusion.  Persistent left lower lobe consolidation and right upper lobe
 opacity.
