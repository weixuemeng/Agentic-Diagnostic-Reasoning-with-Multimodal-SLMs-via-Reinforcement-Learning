                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis, fever, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Left subclavian central line, with tip over proximal/mid SVC, likely near the
 confluence with the left brachiocephalic vein.
 
 Compared with ___ at 14:47 p.m., the overall appearance is similar.  There
 may have been slight worsening of retrocardiac opacity and right cardiophrenic
 patchy opacities.  Possible small left effusion is unchanged.  There is upper
 zone redistribution, likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  No overt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacities at both bases, slightly worse compared with
 ___, and possible small left effusion.  The possibility of an associated
 pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded.
