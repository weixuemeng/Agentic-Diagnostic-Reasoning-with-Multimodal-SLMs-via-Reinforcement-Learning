  ET tube has been removed. No evidence of pneumothorax. Left retrocardiac
  opacitiy persists likely combination of consolidation and small pleural
  effusion without evidence of hydropneumothorax. If clinical concern persists a
  lateral radiograph would be helpful for more definitive evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // ? pneumo
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___:34 and subsequent chest CTA, 21:38,
 available at the time of this review.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 I might question right hilar enlargement and bilateral infrahilar
 consolidation, but the chest CT scan performed 4 hr later showed only mild
 left basal atelectasis.  Interestingly it showed mild mediastinal adenopathy,
 which 1 would not expect to see on conventional bedside chest radiograph.
 
 THERE IS MILD PULMONARY VASCULAR CONGESTION INCREASED SINCE EARLIER IN THE DAY
 AND ANY INCREASE IN BORDERLINE CARDIOMEGALY.
