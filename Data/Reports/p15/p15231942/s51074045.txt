                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with right supraclavicular adenopathy and
 increasing exertional dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest imaging.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Heart size top-normal.  Lungs clear.  No pleural abnormality.  Hila and
 mediastinal contours do not suggest adenopathy but there is rightward tracheal
 deviation in the neck to the thoracic inlet which could be due to lymph node
 enlargement or a thyroid mass.
