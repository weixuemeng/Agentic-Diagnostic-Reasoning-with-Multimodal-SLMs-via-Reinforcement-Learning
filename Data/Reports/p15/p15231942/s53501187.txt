                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged, with similar mild rightward deviation of the trachea. 
 Mild calcification at the aortic knob is again noted.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes
 are noted in the thoracic spine with anterior osteophyte formation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Unchanged mild rightward deviation of the
 trachea, possibly due to an enlarged thyroid gland and clinical correlation is
 recommended.
