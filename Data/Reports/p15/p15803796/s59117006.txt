                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bleach ingestion, question right lower lobe infiltrate on
 previous chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  A right lower lobe linear
 opacity likely represents atelectasis and appears unchanged compared to prior
 study.  The remaining lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Likely right lower lobe atelectasis.  Otherwise, normal
 radiographic examination of the chest.
