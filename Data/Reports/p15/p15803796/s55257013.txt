                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Bleach ingestion with concerns of perforating colon,
 suspected peritoneal air.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiograph were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is no evidence of free air underneath the diaphragm.  The heart size and
 mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear except for new opacity at the
 right lower lung that might reflect small area of atelectasis or developing
 infection/aspiration.  A followup in 24 hours is recommended.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
