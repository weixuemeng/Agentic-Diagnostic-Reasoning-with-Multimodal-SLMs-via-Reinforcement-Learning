 is unchanged in positioning. Small amount of subcutaneous air overlying the
 right hemi thorax is unchanged.
 
 Postsurgical changes in the left hilar, left apical, and left upper
 mediastinum are unchanged. There is unchanged hyper inflation of the left
 apex.
 
 Accounting for low inspiratory volumes, heart is borderline enlarged.
 Pulmonary right hemithorax pulmonary vasculature is enlarged. The left mid and
 lower lung patchy opacities may be secondary to atelectasis from low
 inspiratory.
