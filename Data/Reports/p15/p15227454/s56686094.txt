                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p Chest tube DC. Please perform at 10AM  //
 eval of post pull PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 06:25
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, the chest tube is been removed. No pneumothorax
 is detected. No gross effusion is identified.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Extensive opacities in both
 lungs are again seen.  The differential diagnosis includes CHF with
 interstitial alveolar edema, but the possibility of associated pneumonic
 infiltrates cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of right chest tube. No pneumothorax detected. Extensive
 bilateral opacities remain present. Please see comment above.
