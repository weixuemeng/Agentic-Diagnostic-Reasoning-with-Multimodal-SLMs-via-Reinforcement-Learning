                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Recent lung lesions and history of lymphoma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Surgical clips are
 present along the mediastinum and base the left neck. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Medial right basilar opacity has partly resolved. A
 known large medial right basilar lung nodule is partly obscured. Patchy
 scarring and right lower lateral pleural thickening appear unchanged to
 somewhat decreased. Right suprahilar nodule persists but is difficult to
 assess for small changes with respect to the prior images. Pulmonary nodules
 were better delineated on recent CT imaging.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. Poor visualization of known
 pulmonary nodules; short-term follow-up CT imaging may be helpful to reassess
 known nodules if needed clinically.
