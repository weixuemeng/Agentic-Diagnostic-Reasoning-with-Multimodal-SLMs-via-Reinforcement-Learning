                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p right VATS wedge w/ continued air leak.  //
 Eval ptx/interval change. ***Please perform at ___***
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 06:44
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study and allowing for technical differences, I doubt
 significant interval change. Minimal patchy opacity at the left base may be
 slightly worse.
 
 Clips are again noted over the upper left lung and left hilar region. Again
 seen is relative lucency at the left lung apex, though no well demarcated
 pneumothorax is identified. Given that this is an upright film, this is
 therefore less likely to represent a pneumothorax.
 
 Again seen is right-sided chest tube. No right-sided pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 Background opacities in both lungs are similar to the are otherwise similar to
 the prior film.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible slight worsening of opacity at the left lung base. Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change. No pneumothorax identified.
