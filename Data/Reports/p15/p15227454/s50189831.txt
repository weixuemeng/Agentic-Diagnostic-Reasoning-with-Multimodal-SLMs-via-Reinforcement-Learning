                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with BL shoulder pain  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The paraspinal soft tissue density in the medial right lower lobe is less
 conspicuous when compared to most recent exam but persists.  Blunting of the
 lateral costophrenic angle is compatible with scarring seen on prior CT. 
 Multiple pulmonary nodules were better seen on prior CT scan.  There is no new
 consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Surgical clips
 along the mediastinum on the left and left neck are unchanged.  Right upper
 lung surgical chain sutures again seen.  Known mediastinal and hilar
 adenopathy is better seen on CT scan.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.  Persistent right lower lobe opacity, although
 less conspicuous when compared to prior exam.  Known pulmonary nodules better
 seen on recent CT scan.
