                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob, and chf  // pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multiple right-sided pulmonary nodules are again seen, better assessed on
 prior CT.  Subtle ground-glass opacities in the right lung are better assessed
 on prior CT. Moderate right hilar congestion without overt pulmonary edema. 
 Pleural-based opacity in the right lower lung likely represents scarring, as
 seen on prior CT.  There is no new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Surgical clips are noted
 in the left neck and mediastinum, as well as the left chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate right hilar congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
 2. Re-demonstrated right-sided pulmonary nodules and subtle ground glass
 opacities, better assessed on prior CT.
 3. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
