                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old gentleman with history of likely CAD with silent MI,
 treated mantle cell lymphoma and NSCLC, now with recently biopsied lung
 nodules/tissue found to have necrotizing granulomas, recently admitted
 ___ with dyspnea, hypoxia, anemia, work-up of necrotizing
 granulomas, now returning with fever, cough, dyspnea and scant hemoptysis now
 with subjective SOB when lying flat.  // Eval for effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Postoperative alterations in the left chest wall and left lung appear stable.
 Asymmetrical interstitial pattern predominantly involving the right lung is
 likely due to asymmetrical edema although atypical pneumonia could produce a
 similar appearance. Known right lower lobe mass is seen to better detail on CT
 of 1 day earlier, and note is made of a small right pleural effusion.
