                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx of low EF and CHF now with SOB  //
 vascular congestions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are hyperinflated consistent with emphysema seen on prior CT.
 Multiple right-sided pulmonary nodules are again seen, but better assessed on
 prior CT.  Subtle ground-glass opacities in the right lung identified on prior
 CT likely represent an element of fibrosis.  Vascular congestion is difficult
 to exclude however there is no overt edema.  .  Mild cardiomegaly stable. 
 Stable calcification of the aortic arch.  Blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle appears chronic and likely represent scarring.  Surgical clips
 projecting inferior to the aortic bulb and along the left neck.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval improvement of mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt
 edema.
 2.  Stable pulmonary nodules and solid ground-glass opacities of the right
 lung seen on prior CT.
 3.  Stable emphysema.
