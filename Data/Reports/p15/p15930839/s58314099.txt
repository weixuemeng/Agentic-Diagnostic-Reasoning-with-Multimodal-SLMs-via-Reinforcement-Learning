 cardiomegaly, effusion, infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Large relatively rounded retrocardiac opacity, best
 seen on the frontal view with suggestion of central lucency, may be due to a
 large hiatal hernia.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Top-normal cardiac silhouette size.  No pulmonary edema, focal consolidation,
 or pleural effusions seen.  Large rounded retrocardiac density with central
 lucency may represent a large hiatal hernia.
