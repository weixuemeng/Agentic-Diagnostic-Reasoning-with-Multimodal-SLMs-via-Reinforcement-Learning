                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size and stable compared to
 previous study.  Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery contour is unchanged
 since previous studies, and corresponds to a markedly enlarged pulmonary
 artery on prior CTA of ___.  Lungs are well expanded and clear
 except  for unchanged nonspecific linear scarring in the left upper lobe. 
 There are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Unchanged nonspecific left upper lobe scarring, likely the sequela of a
 previous infection.
 3.  Probable pulmonary arterial hypertension.
