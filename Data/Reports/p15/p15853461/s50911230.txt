 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Followup for resolution of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lingular opacity,
 leading to obliteration of the left heart border, is substantially improved,
 but not completely resolved.  No new parenchymal opacities persist.  There is
 no pleural effusion.  The size of the cardiac silhouette continues to be
 mildly enlarged.  The vascular hilar structures are at the upper range of
 normal.  No parenchymal opacities have newly appeared.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.
