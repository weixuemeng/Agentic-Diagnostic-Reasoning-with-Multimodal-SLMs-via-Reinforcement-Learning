                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and placement of a left-sided pacer
 device with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle,
 unchanged. Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are similar with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted. Lungs are
 hyperinflated. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is new in the interval,
 superimposed on a background of basilar predominant chronic interstitial lung
 disease. Small right pleural effusion is new. No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 Widening of the left AC joint is unchanged, with chronic deformity of the
 distal clavicle compatible with prior trauma. Old right-sided rib fractures
 are also noted.
