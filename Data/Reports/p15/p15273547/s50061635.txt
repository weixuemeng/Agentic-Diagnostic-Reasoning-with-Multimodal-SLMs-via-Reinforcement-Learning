  Very low lung volumes and patient positioning limits assessment of this
  radiograph.  Heterogeneous opacities along the medial aspects of both lung
  bases likely are secondary to vascular crowding in the setting of low lung
  volumes.  Consolidation at either lung base, particularly the left, is not
  excluded.  The left lung apex is obscured by the patient's overlying chin.  No
  definite pleural effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with increased tachypnea and new fever.
 Evaluate for pneumonia or fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___.
 
 There are extremely low lung volumes and the patient's chin overlaps the left
 upper lung field.  This limits the study.  There is crowding of the pulmonary
 vascular markings at the bases with subsegmental atelectasis.  There is also a
 basilar left-sided pleural effusion.  Overall, these findings are stable.  No
 large pneumothoraces or definite consolidation are identified.
