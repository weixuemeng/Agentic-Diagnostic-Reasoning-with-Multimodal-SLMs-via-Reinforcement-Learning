 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:38 PM
  As seen on prior CT examination from ___, there is
  redemonstration of a small to moderate-sized right apical pneumothorax.  There
  is redemonstration of known pneumoperitoneum and right-sided upper abdomen
  subcutaneous emphysema.  Bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  Right-sided PICC line
  terminates in the mid SVC.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 20:03
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumothorax.  Evaluate for progression
 given increasing shortness of breath.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 20:03 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There is a small-to-moderate-sized right apical lateral pneumothorax which
 appears increased in size since ___, but when compared to a CT of
 ___, likely is not significantly changed and more likely is related to
 differences in patient positioning.  However, followup imaging would be
 advised.  There is also a moderate amount of pneumoperitoneum  beneath both
 hemidiaphragms which was not previously appreciated on the plain radiograph,
 possibly due to differences in positioning and again this finding was present
 on the CT of ___.  Clinical correlation would be advised.  Lung volumes
 are low.  Patchy opacities at both bases likely reflect atelectasis.  A right
 subclavian PICC line remains in place with its tip in the distal SVC.  There
 is no evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.
