                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of dislodged cholecystostomy tube
 resulting in right hydropneumothorax.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___ and abdominal CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The pigtail chest tube terminates in the
 right mid lung.  There has been interval resolution of prior pneumothorax.  No
 pneumoperitoneum is evident on this portable examination.  A chronic right
 lower lobe triangular opacity is likely related to persistent atelectasis.  
 Subsegmental left lower lobe atelectasis is similar.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are also likely.  There is no overt interstitial edema.  Lung
 volumes are low.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right chest tube in expected position. Interval resolution of prior right
 pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes with persistent basilar atelectasis and small effusions,
 similar to prior.
