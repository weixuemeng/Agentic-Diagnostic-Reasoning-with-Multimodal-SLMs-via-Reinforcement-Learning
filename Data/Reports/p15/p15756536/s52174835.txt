 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recent pneumothorax, evaluate for lung
 re-expansion.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted for

 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Lungs volumes remain
 low with interval improvement in aeration at the left base likely representing
 resolved atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen, although this study was only
 acquired in the semi-erect position.  No large pleural effusions or pulmonary
 edema is evident.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. 
 Calcification of aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
