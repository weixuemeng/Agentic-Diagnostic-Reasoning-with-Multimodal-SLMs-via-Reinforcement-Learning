 1.  Increasing moderate right apical and lateral pneumothorax with a fluid
 component consistent with a basilar hydropneumothorax.  There continues to be
 pneumoperitoneum, which is likely not significantly changed given differences

 bilateral layering pleural effusions.  Lungs are better inflated with
 improvement in aeration at both bases and no evidence of pulmonary edema.
