                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION: status post right pleural catheter removal, assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 9:30 a.m.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the right basilar pleural catheter with appearance of
 a tiny right apical pneumothorax.   A persistent patchy opacity at the left
 base likely represents an area of atelectasis, though a superimposed
 infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.  There are small layering
 bilateral effusions.  There has been interval improvement in aeration in the
 right lower lung.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  A wet reading was provided by Dr. ___
 ___ by phone to Dr. ___ on ___ at 7:17 p.m., 3 minutes after
 discovery.
