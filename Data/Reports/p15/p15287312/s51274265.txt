                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with tracheostomy and NG tube placement.
 Identify NG tube.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright
 position.There is status post sternotomy and the presence of multiple surgical
 clips to the left of the midline are indicative of previous bypass surgery. 
 The heart is not enlarged.  A tracheostomy cannula is in place.  There is
 evidence of blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus, but no pneumothorax is
 identified in the apical area.  An NG tube has been passed and reaches well
 below the diaphragm. It has entered well into the stomach, its tip points in
 caudal direction.  Thus, it appears to terminate in the mid portion of a
 distended stomach, not reaching the pylorus.  There are overlying moderately
 air distended large bowel loops noted in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 NG tube reaching stomach.
