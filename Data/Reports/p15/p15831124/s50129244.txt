 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with open abdomen, new fever spikes  // Please
 evaluate for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.  The lung
 volumes have decreased. Signs of mild fluid overload are present. There is
 minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, likely reflecting a small
 pleural effusion.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  The left internal jugular
 vein catheter has been removed in the interval. The other monitoring and
 support devices are constant.
