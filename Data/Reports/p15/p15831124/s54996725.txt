                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with worsening abdominal pain  // please
 evaluate for interval change      please evaluate for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study of ___ at 06:26
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The patient is markedly rotated on the current examination limiting evaluation
 of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. In addition, there is overlying
 motion artifact limiting evaluation.  The left internal jugular central line
 and endotracheal tube are likely not changed. A nasogastric tube is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.
 
 There continues to be a hazy appearance to both lungs with some improved
 aeration on the left which could reflect improving pulmonary edema in the
 setting of layering effusions.  Followup imaging with better positioning would
 be recommended.
