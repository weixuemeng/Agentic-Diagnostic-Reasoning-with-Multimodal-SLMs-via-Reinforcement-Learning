 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are in standard position.  Interval
 decrease in width of cardiomediastinal contours accompanied by improving
 pulmonary edema.  Persistent left retrocardiac opacity, which may reflect
 atelectasis and/or consolidation with adjacent small-to-moderate left pleural
 effusion.  Partially layering right pleural effusion persists.
