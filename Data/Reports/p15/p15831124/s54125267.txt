                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Elevated white blood cell count and respiratory
 insufficiency.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 ET tube and left internal jugular line are in unchanged position.  The patient
 is substantially rotated which precludes precise assessment of the radiograph,
 but no substantial change demonstrated.  Repeated radiograph in more symmetric
 AP projection is required.
