                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post gastrectomy for ulcer with open
 abdominal wound and pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right IJ central line has been removed. The tip of an endotracheal tube is
 at the level of the clavicles. A left IJ central line is unchanged in
 position, likely terminating at the superior cavoatrial junction. An enteric
 tube remains in place, but is only visualized to the level of the mid
 esophagus.
 
 Despite low lung volumes, pulmonary edema has increased since ___. 
 Increased opacification of the left hemithorax may be due in part to the more
 supine position of the patient with resultant narrowing of a small left
 pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.  The heart appears enlarged
 despite the projection. The median contour is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening pulmonary edema.
 Stable small left layering pleural effusion.
 ET and left IJ central lines in satisfactory position. Tip of enteric tube not
 visualized. A repeat frontal radiograph may be performed for more definitive
 assessment of its position.
