                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p gastric perf repair and aggressive fluid
 resuscitation  // assess lungs
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is an ET tube which terminates 5.8 cm above the carina. There is
 unchanged position of left-sided IJ central line with distal tip projecting
 over the low SVC. An enteric tube is again seen with distal tip not visualized
 below the lower limit of film.
 
 This is a sub-optimal study with significant motion artifact, which limits
 evaluation. There is stable enlargement of cardiac silhouette. The mediastinal
 contours are unchanged. The bilateral hila are not well visualized.
 
 There has been interval improvement in pulmonary edema, however mild pulmonary
 edema is still present. There is an obscured left hemidiaphragm and
 retrocardiac opacification likely secondary to small left pleural effusion and
 relaxation atelectasis of the adjacent left lower lobe.
 
 There is no right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in now mild pulmonary edema.  Stable small left pleural
 effusion with adjacent left lower lobe atelectasis.
