 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:54 AM
  
  
  
  Complete opacification of left hemithorax with ipsilateral shift of the
  mediastinum, consistent with complete lung collapse is unchanged compared to
  the prior exam. There has been a slight interval increase in the layering
  right pleural effusion, as well as increased subtle opacification of the right
  lung base likely secondary to atelectasis.
