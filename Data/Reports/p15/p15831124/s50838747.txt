 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 05:40.

 Left internal jugular central line and endotracheal tube are unchanged. A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing to the level of the distal esophagus but the
 tip is not identified on the current examination.  There is worsening moderate
 pulmonary edema.  Bilateral layering effusions, left greater than right.
 Retrocardiac consolidation likely reflects partial lower lobe compressive
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax.
