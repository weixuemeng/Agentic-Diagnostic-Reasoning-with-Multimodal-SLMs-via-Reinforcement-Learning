                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest  
 
 Heart size and mediastinum appears to be unchanged.  There is also no change
 in the subcutaneous air collection as well as in the bibasal areas of
 atelectasis.  The rib fractures on the right are substantial.  Apical pleural
 fluid is noted.  Minimal amount of pneumothorax is better appreciated on the
 CT obtained the same day later as well as the rest of the findings, although
 overall seen on the current radiograph.
