                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with rib fractures, evaluate fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 AP and lateral chest examination ___ ___.  Patient's inspirational
 effort much more successful before and diaphragms attain normal position.  The
 heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormality is identified. 
 Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta.  Lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation and there is no pneumothorax in
 the apical area. The on previous examination identified rib fractures have now
 assumed a normal position and the pleural and soft tissue thickening around
 the ribs have diminished.  Also, the previously existing local chest wall
 emphysema has disappeared.
 
 Thoracic spine assumes normal position on lateral view.  A minimally displaced
 fracture is again noted in the mid portion of the right clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement of rib deformities identified on previous
 study.  Detail of additional multiple minor rib injuries and scapular fracture
 would require repeat chest CT.
