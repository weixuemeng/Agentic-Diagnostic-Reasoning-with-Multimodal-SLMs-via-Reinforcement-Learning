 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with right-sided pneumothorax, status
 post motorcycle collision, evaluate for changes in right-sided pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views could not be obtained as patient was
 examined in sitting semi-upright position.  AP frontal and left lateral views
 were obtained.  Comparison is made with the frontal view of the trauma
 examination dated ___.  Multiple fractures in right apical area
 involving first, second and at least third ribs are again identified and
 appear grossly unchanged in their position.  Extensive soft tissue emphysema
 in right shoulder area and lower right neck as before.  There is no conclusive
 evidence for any pneumothorax.  Bilateral atelectatic linear densities are
 seen that appear similar as they were before.
 
 A chest CT examination performed during the examination interval demonstrated
 additional skeletal injury in scapula and clavicle.  The on CT identified tiny
 apical pneumothorax cannot be seen on this portable single view chest
 examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest in a patient with acute trauma including several rib
 fractures in right apical area and shoulder area.
