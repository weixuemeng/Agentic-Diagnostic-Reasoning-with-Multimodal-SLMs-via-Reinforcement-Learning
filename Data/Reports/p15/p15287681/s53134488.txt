                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with substernal epigastric pain.  Evaluate for
 evidence of pneumonia or any other cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___, and subsequent CT abdomen and
 pelvis performed during this admission.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are poorly expanded, accounting for some vascular
 crowding.  A triangular opacity in the right costophrenic angle is likely a
 combination of vascular crwoding and transient atelectasis as a subsequent CT
 did not show abnormality in this region.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
