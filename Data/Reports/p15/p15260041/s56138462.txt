 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Frontal chest x-ray from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  There is an approximate 1.2 cm nodule
 identified at the left lung base not clearly seen on the prior.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear without consolidation, effusion or pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Note
 is made of a probable hiatal hernia.  Degenerative changes are noted in the
 spine.  There is also a wedge deformity in the upper lumbar spine, age
 indeterminate.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2. Left lung base pulmonary nodule for which a nonurgent followup CT chest can
 be performed.
 
 3.  Compression deformity in the upper lumbar spine, age indeterminate.
