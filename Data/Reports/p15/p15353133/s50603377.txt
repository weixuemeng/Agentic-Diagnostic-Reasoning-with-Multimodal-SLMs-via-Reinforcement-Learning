                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with renal transplant.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Aside from minimal
 atelectasis in the left lower lobe, the lungs are clear.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions are small.  There is no evidence of pneumonia, CHF, or pneumothorax.
 Increase in the AP diameter of the chest suggests COPD.
