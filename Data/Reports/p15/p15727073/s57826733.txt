                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman getting treatment for breast cancer with a
 persistent cough.  Rule out infection.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Lungs well expanded with only a single focus of mild peribronchial
 infiltration, seen only on the lateral view projecting over the posterior
 aspect of the left ventricle.  This could be a very small focus of pneumonia. 
 Lungs are otherwise clear of detectable abnormality.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.  Dr. ___ ___ I
 discussed these findings by telephone at the time of dictation.
