                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sickle cell disease, here with pain crisis and
 abdominal as well as chest pain.  Please assess for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no comparison studies available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Left PICC line ends at the cavoatrial junction.  Cardiac silhouette is
 moderately widened by cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.  Pulmonary
 vascular congestion is attributable to a combination of left heart dysfunction
 and overcirculation due to chronic anemia, but there is no pleural effusion or
 azygos distension to indicate total body volume overload.  Lungs are clear.
 Only one of the thoracic vertebral bodies show early H shaped configuration
 due to sickle cell disease and the spleen is not autoinfarcted; is this
 patient homozygos for sickle cell disease?
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly and possible pericardial effusion (not
 hemodynamically significant).  No focal consolidation.
