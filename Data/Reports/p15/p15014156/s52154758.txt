                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sickle cell disease and fever.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, 2 VWS
 
 Compared with ___, no definite change is detected.  Some increased
 markings are noted on the lateral view in the lower lobe posteriorly -- 
 ? prominent vascular markings versus early pneumonic infiltrate.  No other
 focal opacities and no frank consolidation is detected.  No pleural effusion. 
 Again seen is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and upper zone re-distribution
 with mild vascular plethora, but no other evidence of CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly and vascular plethora, unchanged compared with ___.
 
 2.  Equivocal focal opacity in the lower lobe posteriorly, seen on the lateral
 view. It appears slightly more prominent on today's exam than on the ___
 study. While this could be an artifact due to prominent lower lobe  vessels,
 the possibility of a focal pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.
