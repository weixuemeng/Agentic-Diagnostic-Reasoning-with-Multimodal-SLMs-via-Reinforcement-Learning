                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post left-sided adrenalectomy,
 adherent to diaphragm, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  There is now a mild hazy density on the left base, possibly
 representing some pleural effusion, but the diaphragmatic contour is still
 well preserved.  No pneumothorax can be identified.  In comparison with the
 next preceding chest examination from an outside hospital dated ___,
 chest findings are grossly unaltered, but on the left base, the present small
 densities are probably some postoperative small atelectasis.  Again no
 pneumothorax is seen.
