                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with past medical history of cardiac compression
 with persistent chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Prominent interstitial
 markings in the lower lungs, accompanying mild cardiomegaly and small pleural
 effusions reflect mild pulmonary edema.
 Patchy opacification obscuring the right heart border could be confluent edema
 or lung contusion after recent chest compressions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild congestive heart failure.  Possible right lung contusion.
  Although no fracture is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not
 sensitive for detection of chest cage trauma. Regions where there are focal
 findings of possible trauma should be clearly marked and imaged with bone
 detail views.
