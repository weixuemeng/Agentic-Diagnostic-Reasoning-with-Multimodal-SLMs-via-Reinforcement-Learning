                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with acute onset dizziness, past pointing to left
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Patchy opacities are
 demonstrated in the lung bases most likely reflective of atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Moderate
 multilevel degenerative changes are re- demonstrated throughout the thoracic
 spine with anterior bridging osteophytes compatible with diffuse idiopathic
 skeletal hyperostosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.
