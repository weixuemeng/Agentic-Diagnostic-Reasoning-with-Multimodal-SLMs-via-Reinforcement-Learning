                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is normal.  The lungs
 are underinflated. A vaugue right middle lobe opacity likely reflects
 brnchovascular crowding or atelectasis. The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite consolidations. Poor inspiratory effort.  If there is
 suspicion for infection, a repeat radiograph can be obtained to better assess
 the right middle lobe and lung bases.
