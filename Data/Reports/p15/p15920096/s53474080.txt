 well localized on the lateral view.  Heart size is normal.  Aorta is tortuous.
 Lungs are clear except for relatively symmetrical biapical scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No radiographic evidence of acute, displaced rib fracture or pneumothorax.

 external to the patient, although a discrete pulmonary nodule is not excluded.

 of external leads.
