                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lymphadenopathy c/f malignancy now s/p
 bronch w/RIGHT stent placed in bronchus intermedius  // ptx, stent baseline
 
 COMPARISON:  Targeted review of CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  The known sub carinal mass may account for
 effacement of the aortopulmonary window.  A right mainstem bronchus stent is
 seen.  There are increased vascular and interstitial markings,
 right-greater-than-left, with more focal patchy and confluent opacity at the
 right lung base.  Small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  The left
 costophrenic sulcus is clear.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right mainstem bronchus stent present.  No pneumothorax detected.
 2. Increased interstitial markings.  More focal opacities at the right lung
 base could represent a postobstructive pneumonia and followup imaging to
 confirm resolution is recommended.
 3. Stellate right right upper lobe lesion seen on the recent CT scan is not
 definitely appreciated radiographically.  As per the recent chest CT, if
 clinically indicated, PET-CT could help for further assessment.
