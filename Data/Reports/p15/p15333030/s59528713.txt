 radiodensity best seen on lateral view at costovertebral junction in the lower
 thoracic spine corresponds to a known expansile lytic rib lesion in left ___

 right humerus and spine are better seen on prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. No evidence of pneumonia.  
 2. Known left 7th rib expansile lytic metastatic lesion.  
 3. Additional right humeral and vertebral bony metastases are better depicted
