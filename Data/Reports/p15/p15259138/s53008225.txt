                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of breast
 cancer after surgery and chemotherapy, currently with progressive dyspnea.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are essentially clear
 within the limitations of the study technique.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Surgical clips are projecting over the left hemithorax
 related to recent breast surgery.  The right breast clips are seen as well,
 findings most likely consistent with breast reconstruction.
