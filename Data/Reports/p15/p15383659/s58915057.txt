                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of atrial fibrillation, chest pain
 for 1 hr and vomiting. Evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___ as
 well as a CT chest with contrast from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded and clear. Splaying of the carina, double cardiac
 silhouette in the left, and a transverse dimension of the right atrium of 11.2
 cm are compatible with right atrial enlargement which appears stable compared
 with the previous exam allowing for difference in technique. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable moderate cardiomegaly with primary right atrial contribution.  No
 evidence of pneumonia.
