                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing for
 low lung volumes.  New patchy and linear opacities in the left lower lobe are
 probably due to atelectasis in the setting of recent abdominal surgery.  There
 is no substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy and linear left lower lobe opacities favor atelectasis
 over infectious pneumonia.
