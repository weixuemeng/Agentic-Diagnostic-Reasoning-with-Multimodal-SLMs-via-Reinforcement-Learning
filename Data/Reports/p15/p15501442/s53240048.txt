  Cardiac silhouette mildly enlarged and indistinct. Mediastinal contour normal.
  Increased bilateral opacities, most pronounced at the lung bases with blunting
  of bilateral costophrenic angles right greater than left, compatible with
  pleural effusions. Overall findings are consistent with moderate pulmonary
  edema.
