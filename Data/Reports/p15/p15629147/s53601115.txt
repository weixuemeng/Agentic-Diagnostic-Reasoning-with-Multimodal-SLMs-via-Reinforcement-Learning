                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with altered mental status.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged, predominantly the left ventricle.  Mediastinum
 is stable.  Lungs are essentially clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 The lateral view demonstrates suspicious opacity anteriorly that most likely
 represents fat pad, but assessment with chest CT is recommended to exclude the
 possibility of anterior mediastinal lesion.
