                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with productive cough.  On exam has diffuse mild
 expiratory rhonchi and some faint bibasilar rales concerning for possible
 atypical pneumonia, less likely lobar.  // rule out pneumonia    rule out
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___. 
 Impression:
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and essentially clear, aside from a triangular
 opacity projecting over the lateral aspect of the right midlung and at the
 level of the anterior sixth rib that is probably fissural pleural thickening. 
 I would recommend shallow oblique views to exclude a lung nodule. Lungs are
 otherwise unremarkable and there is no pleural effusion or focal pleural
 abnormality elsewhere.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
