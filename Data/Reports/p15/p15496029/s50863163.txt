                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Right pleuritic chest pain.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  Transvenous pacemaker leads are in the standard
 position, in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions are small.  The lungs are hyperinflated suggesting the presence of
 emphysema.  There are bibasilar atelectases.  There is kyphosis and
 wedge-shaped compression fractures of mid thoracic vertebral bodies.
