                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Lungs are low in volume resulting in bronchovascular crowding. 
 Within this limitation, mild pulmonary vascular congestion is suspected. 
 Bibasilar left greater than right opacities are most likely atelectasis though
 superimposed infection would be difficult to exclude.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  The heart is top-normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION: Limited study due to low lung volumes with likely bibasilar
 atelectasis and pulmonary vascular congestion.  Infection cannot be excluded
 and repeat images with improved inspiration are recommended if infection
 remains a high clinical concern.
