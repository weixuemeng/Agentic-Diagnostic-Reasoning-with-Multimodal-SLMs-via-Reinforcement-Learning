                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, hypoxia, asthma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CTA chest from ___.  Multiple prior radiographs,
 most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable upright radiograph is provided.  Low lung volumes
 and resultant bronchovascular crowding limits examination in addition to
 patient body habitus.  There is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm which
 may represent left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation or effusion.  Right
 basilar opacity medially is also more conspicuous on the current exam.  There
 is also likley mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Heart size is top normal. 
 There is no right pleural effusion; however, left pleural effusion cannot be
 excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study due to low lung volumes and body habitus.  Opacity
 at the bases may represent atelectasis versus consolidation and/or pleural
 effusion (on the left).  Possible mild pulmonary edema.
