                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 HISTORY:  Abnormal lung base on abdominal CT.
 
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___, read in conjunction with
 imaging of the lower chest on abdomen CT ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and a generally large and very tortuous thoracic aorta
 are unchanged compared to chest radiographs, ___.  I concur with the
 interpretation on the abdominal CT scan that the nodular abnormality in the
 right lung, just inferior to the right inferior pulmonary vein could be
 atelectasis due to the very tortuous thoracic aorta meandering from the left
 to the right of midline.  If, however, there is immediate concern about the
 possibility of a lung mass, then I would repeat the CT scan of the chest using
 intravenous contrast agent scanning the patient in the prone position to
 improve aeration at the posterior lung bases.
