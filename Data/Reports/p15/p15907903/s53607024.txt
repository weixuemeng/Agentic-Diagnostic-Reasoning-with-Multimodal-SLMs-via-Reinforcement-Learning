                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post open AVR, MVR on ___, presenting
 with progressive worsening of DOE, orthopnea, PND.  Evaluate for evidence of

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has slightly increased in the
 interim.  A small left pleural effusion is perhaps slightly smaller compared
 to the prior exam.  Opacity in the lower lungs could be atelectasis of most
 concurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No frank pulmonary edema or focal
 consolidation in the remaining aerated lung.  Heart size is mildly enlarged,
 unchanged.  Mediastinum is not widened.  Median sternotomy wires, replaced
 cardiac valve, dual lead cardiac device are unchanged.  Aortic knob
 calcifications are unchanged. No pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality.
