 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 845  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cirrhosis and effusions, assess for
 change.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 845 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Feeding tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 
 There are stable moderate-to-large bilateral effusions.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.  Bibasilar patchy opacities likely
 reflect compressive atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
