                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small right apical lateral pneumothorax has slightly decreased in
 size.  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is similar to the prior study,
 with persistent adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation in the right middle
 and right lower lobes.  Small left pleural effusion is unchanged, but
 nonspecific left retrocardiac opacity has slightly worsened.
