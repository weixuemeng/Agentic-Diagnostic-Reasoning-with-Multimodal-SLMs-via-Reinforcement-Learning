                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis complicated by ascites and pleural effusions.  Evaluate
 pleural effusion.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  A moderate right pleural
 effusion has increased since ___.  Opacities in the right lower lung
 most likely represent atelectasis; however, superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded.  The previosly seen left lung opaciites have cleared. The left lung
 is now well expanded.  There is no pneumothorax.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  The heart size is normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in a moderate right pleural effusion. adjacent
 right lower and middle lobe opacities most likely represent atelectasis, but
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
