                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Small right pneumothorax is minimally enlarged and this could though due to
 difference in positioning of the patient.  Large right pleural effusion is
 grossly unchanged.  Mild left effusion is more conspicuous than before, also
 could be due to difference in positioning of the patient.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are midline, obscured by parenchymal abnormalities.
