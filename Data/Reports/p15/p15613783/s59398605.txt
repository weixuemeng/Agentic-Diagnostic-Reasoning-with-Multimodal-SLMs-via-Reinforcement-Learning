                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma with shortness of breath
 after stopping diuretics.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  Again there are bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on the
 right, with underlying atelectatic changes.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
