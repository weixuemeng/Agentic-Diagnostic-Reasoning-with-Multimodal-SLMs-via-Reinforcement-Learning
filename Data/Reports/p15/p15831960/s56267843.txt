 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and fever, evaluate for pneumonia.

 increased opacity identified at the right lung base medially, localizing to
 the lower lobe on the lateral exam.  Elsewhere, lungs are clear.  There is no
 effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous
 and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity at the right lung base medially, potentially
 atelectasis or pneumonia; however, clinical correlation is suggested.
