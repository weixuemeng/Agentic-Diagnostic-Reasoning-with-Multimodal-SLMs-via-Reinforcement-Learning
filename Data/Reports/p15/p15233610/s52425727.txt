  No displaced rib fractures detected although the lower-most lateral left ribs
  are excluded from view.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Intact median
  sternotomy wires.  Right pectoral pacemaker with 3 leads in place.  No prior
  studies available for comparison.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and valve replacement.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is present.  Right-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads
 terminating in the region of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Widening
 of the superior mediastinal contour is noted, which could be due to low lung
 volumes and the presence of mediastinal fat.  There is crowding of
 bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion noted. 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no displaced fractures
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with patchy retrocardiac opacity likely
 reflecting atelectasis.  Widening of the superior mediastinal contour may be
 related to low lung volumes; comparison with prior radiographs would be
 helpful, if there is continued concern for acute traumatic injury within the
 chest, a chest CT is recommended.
