 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are relatively hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Medial right lung
 base opacity is similar to prior and may represent atelectasis or epicardial
 fat pad.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is no new
 focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There may be a
 hiatal hernia.
