 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:45 PM
  Findings suggestive of COPD.  Nodular opacity at the right lung base and
  scarring at the left lung apex.  Dedicated nonurgent chest CT is suggested to
  exclude underlying mass lesion.  Alternatively, correlation with older films
  should they become available can be performed.  No evidence of acute
  cardiopulmonary process.

 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with intermittent shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are hyperinflated with increased
 AP diameter and diameter.  Region of increased lucency seen in the right mid
 to upper lung.  Overall findings are compatible with COPD.  Increased density
 projecting at the left lung apex possibly in association with the surgical
 chain sutures as well as a nodular opacity at the right lung base.  There is
 no evidence of focal consolidation nor effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities active.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings suggestive of COPD.  Nodular opacity at the right lung base and
 scarring at the left lung apex.  Dedicated nonurgent chest CT is suggested to
 exclude underlying mass lesion.  Alternatively, correlation with older films
 should they become available can be performed.  No evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
