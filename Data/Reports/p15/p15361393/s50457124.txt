                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left lateral chest wall pain after fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Patchy opacity in the left
 lower lobe most likely reflects atelectasis.  A small left pleural effusion is
 likely present.  The right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 Remote left third anterior rib fracture is identified, but no acutely
 displaced fractures are otherwise seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe patchy opacity, likely atelectasis with small left pleural
 effusion.  No displaced fractures are visualized.  If there is continued
 concern for a rib fracture, consider a dedicated rib series.
