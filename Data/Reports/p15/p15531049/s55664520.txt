                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC line placed two weeks ago.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 A right subclavian PICC line is present.  The tip is not well delineated.  It
 can be traced as far as the proximalmost SVC and may overlie the distal SVC. 
 No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Compared with ___, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Upper zone
 redistribution and atelectasis at the left base is also unchanged.  No CHF,
 frank consolidation or gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right subclavian PICC line tip not optimally demonstrated, likely
 over SVC.
