                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with alcoholic cirrhosis, rectal cancer s/p
 resection and colectomy with secondary peritonitis // please perform ONLY
 oblique imaging. Determine position of PICC line
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Plain chest radiograph dated ___. Correlation also
 made to chest CT dated ___ and CT abdomen/pelvis dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of a right PICC line projects over the mid SVC. The tip of a left
 pectoral power port projects over to the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. An
 irregularly-shaped opacity at the right lung base corresponds to a focal
 consolidation identified on recent CT abdomen/ pelvis, and may be due to
 atelectasis, infection or aspiration. Cardiomegaly with left atrial
 enlargement is unchanged. Two old healed left rib fractures are incidentally
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No appreciable interval change in focal right middle lobe airspace opacity
 which may be due to atelectasis, but infection or aspiration would be
 difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Right PICC line in satisfactory position in the mid SVC.
 
 Stable cardiomegaly with left atrial enlargement.
