                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 22:21.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with alcohol withdrawal, chest discomfort,
 question acute process.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 Portable AP study ___ at 22:21 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The heart appears enlarged given portable technique and may reflect
 cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. 
 Mediastinal contours appear widened, although this may be related to patient
 rotation on the current study.  Followup imaging with a PA and lateral chest
 film would be recommended.  Lung volumes are low with crowding of the
 vasculature.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  No large
 pneumothorax, although sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished
 given supine technique.  No acute bony abnormality appreciated.
