                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Questionable aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from 14:52 today, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed. The lungs are
 better expanded on this exam.  There is no focal consolidation to suggest
 aspiration or pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Prominence of the interstitium and enlargement of the superior vena cava
 likely reflects mild pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Improved lung volumes with mild pulmonary edema and no evidence
 for aspiration.
