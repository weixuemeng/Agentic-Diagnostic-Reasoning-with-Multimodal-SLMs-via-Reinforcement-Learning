                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Swollen right leg.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified. 
 Rightward tracheal deviation at the level of the thoracic inlet may be due to
 underlying left thyroid lobe enlargement.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  Patchy opacities in
 the lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.  There is also mild
 anterior wedging of a low thoracic vertebral body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement with small bilateral pleural effusions and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
