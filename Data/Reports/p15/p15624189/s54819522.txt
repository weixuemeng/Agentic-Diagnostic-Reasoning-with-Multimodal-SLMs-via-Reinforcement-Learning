                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette persists.  Aorta is tortuous and
 calcified.  Right PICC tip terminates in the proximal right atrium, unchanged.
 Widening of the right paratracheal stripe is concerning for lymphadenopathy. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted with
 adjacent compressive atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Mild anterior
 wedging of a lower thoracic vertebral body is re- demonstrated with multilevel
 degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 2. Widened right paratracheal stripe suggestive of underlying lymphadenopathy.
