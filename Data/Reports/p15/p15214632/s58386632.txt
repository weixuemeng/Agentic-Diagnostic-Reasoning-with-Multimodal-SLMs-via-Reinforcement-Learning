                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post ex lap. Rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 3:50 a.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film, lung volumes are similar.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged.  Again seen is upper zone
 re-distribution and mild diffuse vascular plethora.  Also again seen is
 retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  There is patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region as
 well, similar, though possibly slightly more pronounced than on the prior
 film, concerning for focal infiltrate or focus of aspiration.  There is
 minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles, without gross effusion.
