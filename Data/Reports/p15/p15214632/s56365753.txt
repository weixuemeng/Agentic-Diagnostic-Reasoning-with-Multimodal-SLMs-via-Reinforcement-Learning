                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative chest pain, to assess for pulmonary embolism.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung
 volumes that accentuate the prominence of the transverse diameter of the
 heart.  There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Retrocardiac opacification most likely reflects
 some combination of volume loss in the lower lobe and adjacent effusion.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
