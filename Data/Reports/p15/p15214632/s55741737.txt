                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post exploratory laparotomy.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged.  Left lower lobe
 opacities are increasing consistent with increasing atelectasis.  A small left
 effusion is probably unchanged.  There is mild vascular congestion. Right
 perihilar faint opacities are likely atelectasis.  Attention in followup
 studies is recommended to exclude a left developing infection.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
