                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with 2 weeks dyspnea on exertion, tachycardia,
 history of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Previously noted nodular opacities
 primarily in an upper lobe distribution seen on CT are not clearly present on
 the current radiograph.  Linear opacity in the left lower lobe is new, and may
 reflect chronic eosinophilic pneumonia.    No new focal consolidation is
 otherwise present.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Linear opacity in the left lower lobe is new and may reflect an area of
 chronic eosinophilic pneumonia.  Previously noted upper lobe predominant
 nodular opacities on CT are not clearly present on the current radiograph.
