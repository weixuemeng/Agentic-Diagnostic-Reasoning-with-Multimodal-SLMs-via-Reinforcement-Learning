                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  The aortic
 arch is heavily calcified.  There is a convex contour to the right upper
 mediastinum, fairly typical for mediastinal contour frequently seen with
 tortuosity of the great vessels, but are not specific.  Other etiologies
 including lymphadenopathy or a large thyroid nodule could be considered.  A
 band-like opacity in the lingula suggests minor atelectasis or scarring. 
 There is also streaky posterior left basilar opacity which suggests minor
 atelectasis or scarring.  There is more generally a mild interstitial
 abnormality suggesting slight vascular congestion, including peribronchial
 cuffing, although possibly airway inflammation could yield a similar
 appearance.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones appear
 demineralized.  Mild degenerative changes are noted along the mid thoracic
 spine, which also demonstrates mild rightward convex curvature centered along
 the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Mild interstitial abnormality which could be seen with mild vascular
 congestion, although other etiologies such as airway inflammation could be
 considered.  
 
 2.  Abnormal right upper mediastinal contour; although this appearance is
 frequently seen with benign tortuosity of the great vessels, investigation
 with chest CT is recommended when clinically appropriate, unless more remote
 prior radiographs are available to show long-term stability of this
 appearance.  This finding and recommendation for chest CT was documented in
 the clinical ER discharge summary.
