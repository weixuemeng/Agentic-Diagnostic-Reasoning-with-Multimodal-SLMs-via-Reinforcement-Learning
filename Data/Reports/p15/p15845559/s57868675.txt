                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Somewhat linear left basilar opacity is again seen
 suggestive of atelectasis.  Elsewhere the lungs are clear of consolidation or
 effusion.  Again seen is prominent mediastinal contour superiorly on the
 right, potentially due to tortuous vessels however as previously suggested
 nonurgent CT suggested to further characterize.  Degenerative changes seen at
 shoulders bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Upper mediastinal
 contour on the right as on prior potentially due to tortuous vessels however
 CT scan suggested on a nonurgent basis unless already performed or if older
 films become available to document significant stability.
