                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Palpitations.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The aorta is tortuous and
 diffusely calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits
 otherwise.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Left basilar linear and
 streaky opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures with multilevel
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild left basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
