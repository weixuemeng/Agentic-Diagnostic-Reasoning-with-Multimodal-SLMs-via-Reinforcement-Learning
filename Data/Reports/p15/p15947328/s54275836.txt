                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Rib fracture in pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The aortic arch is calcified.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is moderately elevated. The colon appears interposed beneath the
 right hemidiaphragm which probably explains lucency beneath the diaphragm.  On
 the left side, there is a small pneumothorax.  The distance between the
 superior pleural edge and the chest wall is about 14 mm.  The lungs appear
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion.  There is a very mildly displaced
 posterior lateral left eighth rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small pneumothorax on the left.  Minimally displaced left eighth rib fracture.
 Moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm; lucency beneath the
 right hemidiaphragm is probably due to colonic interposition.
