                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORTABLE PICC LINE PLACEMENT
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new PICC, new DHT  // ?PICC placement after
 removal of central line, ?DHT placement      ?PICC placement after removal of
 central line, ?DHT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the new left subclavian
 PICC line extends to about the level of the cavoatrial junction.  There is
 also a Dobhoff tube with the tip in the lower stomach.  Opacification in the
 retrocardiac region with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm raises the
 possibility of volume loss in left lower lobe with possible small effusion. 
 Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure, though in part it could merely be a manifestation of low lung
 volumes.
