                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 8:34 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 Dobbhoff catheter.  The catheter is malpositioned and coiled in the esophagus.
 The tube needs to be repositioned.  This reposition has been confirmed on a
 later chest radiograph.
 
 Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged, including the signs of
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
