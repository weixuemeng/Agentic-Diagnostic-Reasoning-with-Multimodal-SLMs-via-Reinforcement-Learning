 INDICATION:  Status post intubation.  Evaluate tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph obtained at an outside hospital from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is slightly high, approximately 7.4 cm from

 stomach.  The sideport is at the gastroesophageal junction.  There is mild
 pulmonary vasculature congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  There is no
 focal opacity, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours
 are normal.  The heart size is mildly enlarged, which may be related to
 positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slightly high endotracheal tube approximately 7.4 cm from the carina. 
 Recommend repositioning.
 2.  Enteric tube with the sideport at the gastroesophageal junction, suggest
 advancement so that it is well within the stomach.
 3.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and possible mild cardiomegaly.
