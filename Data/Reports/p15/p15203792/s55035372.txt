 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated for question aspiration, assess
 for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 5 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left subclavian central line, nasogastric tube, endotracheal tube are
 unchanged in position.  There is interval improvement in the vascular
 congestion.  A streaky linear opacity at the right base likely reflects
 subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  A subtle radiopaque oval opacity in the left lateral mid
 lung field is again noted and may be pleural in etiology.  No pleural
 effusions.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
