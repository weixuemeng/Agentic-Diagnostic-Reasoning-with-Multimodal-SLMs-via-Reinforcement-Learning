 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Stroke, Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The previously malpositioned Dobbhoff catheter has been removed and
 replaced by a new catheter.  The course of the new catheter is unremarkable,
 the tip of the catheter projects over the distal parts of the stomach.  There
 is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.  The pre-existing
 parenchymal opacities in the lung and the left pleural effusion appear to have
 decreased minimally.
