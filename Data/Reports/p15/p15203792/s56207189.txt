                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with stroke, question aspiration pneumonia. 
 Check left-sided lines.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP chest film dated ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval intubation with the tip of the nasogastric tube approximately 6 cm
 above the carina. Left subclavian central line with its tip in the proximal to
 mid SVC. A nasogastric tube remains in place with its tip projecting over the
 stomach.  There is improving, but persistent vascular congestion.  More focal
 patchy opacity at the left base persists and may reflect an area of early
 pneumonia or aspiration, although atelectasis should also be considered. 
 Stably enlarged heart with several more focal radiopaque oval opacities
 projecting over the left lateral lung field which could reflect calcified
 pleural plaques.  These can be better assessed on PA and lateral imaging when
 the patient is clinically stable.  No pneumothorax.
