                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pneumonia, status post treatment with increased
 tremors and lethargy.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart size is
 normal.  Calcification in the aortic arch is noted.  The hila are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Increased
 bilateral interstitial markings, slightly more so throughout the right lung
 field are seen.  Additionally, more focal opacities are appreciated on the
 frontal view in the right mid lung field.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings, especially in the right lung
 field which may be consistent with infection or asymmetric pulmonary edema. 
 Chronic interstitial process is also possible.  More focal opacity in the
 right lateral mid lung zone may be due to infection, no priors are available
 for comparison to assess for interval change/chronicity. Recommend follow-up
 to resolution to exclude an underlying pulmonary lesion.
