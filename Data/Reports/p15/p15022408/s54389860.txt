                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent surgery.  Evaluate for pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower.  There are
 increased bibasilar opacities, which likely represent atelectases.  A
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is no pulmonary edema.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion.  The small apical pneumothorax identified on the
 prior exam is not visualized on today's exam.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  The cardiac size is minimally enlarged, and unchanged from the prior
 exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing bibasilar opacities, likely due to atelectasis.  A pneumonia
 cannot be completely excluded.
 2.  Resolution of the small right apical pneumothorax.
