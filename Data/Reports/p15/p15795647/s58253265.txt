                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST X-RAY
 
 HISTORY:  Empyema.  Cough.  Evaluate NG tube placement.
 
 One semi-erect portable view.  Comparison with the previous study of ___. 
 Patchy increased density in the left lung and overlying pleural thickening or
 fluid is redemonstrated, as is subsegmental atelectasis at the right lung
 base. A partially circumscribed lucency now demonstrated in the lower left
 chest that may represent loculated air.  The cardiomediastinal structures are
 unchanged.  Left chest tubes, a nasogastric tube and PICC line remain in
 place.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No change in placement of tube and line.  Small
 well-circumscribed lucency in the lower left chest may represent loculated air
 in the pleural space.
