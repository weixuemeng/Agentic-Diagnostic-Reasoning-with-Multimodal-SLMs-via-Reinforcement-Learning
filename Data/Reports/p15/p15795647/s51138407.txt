                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are persistent bibasilar opacifications compatible with
 atelectasis, however aspiration or pneumonia is also possible.  These are not
 significantly changed since the prior study.  Interval placement of NG tube is
 seen along the expected course of the esophagus, entering the stomach, distal
 tip is not well seen but is likely within the stomach.  There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax.  Remaining lines and tubes are unchanged in position since
 the prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:  NG tube courses into the stomach and likely terminates in the
 distal stomach.  Remaining lines and tubes are unchanged in position since the
 prior study.
 
 The above findings were entered as a wet read by Dr. ___ on ___
