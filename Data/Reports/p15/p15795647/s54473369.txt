                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative hypotension.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes.
 There is engorgement of pulmonary vessels, consistent with the clinical
 impression of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Opacification at the right
 base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm could reflect merely atelectatic change
 with pleural fluid.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.  Less prominent opacification at the
 left base most likely reflects a combination of atelectasis and effusion.
 
 
 
 PATIENT'S NAME:  ___
 ACCESSION NUMBER:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  Encephalopathy and intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal
 tube remains above the clavicular level, approximately 9 cm above the carina. 
 Dobbhoff tube is essentially unchanged.  There are better lung volumes with
 some residual atelectatic change at the left base.
