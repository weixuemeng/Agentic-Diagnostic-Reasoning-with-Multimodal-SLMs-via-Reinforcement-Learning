 WET READ VERSION #1 
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Multifocal pneumonia and PICC line.  Suspected to be
 in the right atrium.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 As compared to ___ chest CT obtained the same day at 5:35 p.m. the
 multifocal consolidations are grossly unchanged.  Heart size and mediastinum
 are unchanged.  The right PICC line tip on the current radiograph is not
 clearly seen beyond the cavoatrial junction.  On the prior CT chest obtained 2
 hours ago was clearly demonstrated to be in the right atrium.  It was not
 pulled in the meantime interval, thus most likely remains in the right atrium.
 For precise details, please review the CT and the corresponding report.
