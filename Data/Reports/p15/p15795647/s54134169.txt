                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Mental status change and cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is a mild interstitial abnormality suggestive of pulmonary vascular
 congestion, but not nearly as striking as on the prior examination.  Streaky
 left basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis.  There is probably a trace
 pleural effusion, at least on the right side.  The bones appear demineralized.
 Surgical clips project over the central epigastrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
