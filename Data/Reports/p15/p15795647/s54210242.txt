                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 8:58
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recent empyema status post
 decortication, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 14:47.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 8:58 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left basilar pigtail catheter and right PICC line remain unchanged in
 position.  Interval reduction in lung volumes with persistent multifocal
 patchy opacities throughout the left lung.  The right lung demonstrates patchy
 opacity at the base likely reflecting atelectasis.  No large pneumothorax is
 seen.  A left basilar chest tube remains in place as well.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in patient
 positioning and technique.
