                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left empyema, chest tubes.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 16:08 p.m., no significant change is identified. 
 Again seen are two left-sided chest tubes, and an NG tube extending beneath
 the diaphragm, off the film.  PICC line tip at SVC/RA junction.
 
 Again seen is patchy alveolar opacity throughout the mid and lower zones of
 the left lung, consistent with atelectasis and/or consolidation.  The right
 lung is grossly clear, except for minimal patchy atelectasis at the base. Mild
 prominence of upper zone vessels may relate to low-inspiratory volumes.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No significant change compared with ___.
