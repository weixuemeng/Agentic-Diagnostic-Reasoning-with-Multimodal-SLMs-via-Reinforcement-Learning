                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea.  Question pneumonia.  History of
 recently biopsied left lung base mass compatible with metastatic melanoma.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___ and ___.
 
 Left lower lobe lung mass is again noted.  Margins on the current exam are
 less clearly delineated when compared to pre-biopsy exam, however, appear
 similar to prior portable exam from ___.  There is increased opacity
 more posteriorly in the left lower lobe, potentially due to consolidation,
 post-biopsy changes and possible underlying small effusion.  Elsewhere, the
 lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Left shoulder
 arthroplasty again noted.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change since prior.
