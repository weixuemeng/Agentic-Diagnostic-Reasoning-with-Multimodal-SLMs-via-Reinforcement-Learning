                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The right acromioclavicular joint is partially imaged but there may be
 slight elevation of the distal right clavicle in relation to the acromion;
 recommend clinical correlation and consider dedicated imaging of this region
 as warranted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Clear lungs.
 2.  Right acromioclavicular joint partially imaged; however, the distal right
 clavicle may be slightly elevated in relation to the acromion; recommend
 clinical correlation for discomfort at this site and consider dedicated
 imaging of this location as clinically warranted.
