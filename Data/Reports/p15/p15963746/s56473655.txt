                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 4:22.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypoxemic respiratory failure, assess
 for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 4:52.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:22 was submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Spinal hardware is again seen obscuring some of the detail.  A right
 internal jugular central line continues to have its tip unchanged in position
 likely in the distal SVC.  An endotracheal tube is in position with its tip
 approximately 2 cm above the carina.  Once again, the patient is markedly
 rotated left limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. 
 There has been interval improvement in aeration in the left upper and mid lung
 but there is still likely lower lobe collapse.  A superimposed infectious
 process cannot be entirely excluded.  There also possibly is a layering left
 effusion.  The right lung remains grossly clear.  No pneumothorax is seen.
