                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with increased secretions and fevers,
 elevated white count, question aspiration pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film on ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There is spinal hardware in place.  The patient is markedly rotated on the
 current examination, which limits evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal
 contours.  There does appear to be an increasing opacity overlying the left
 hemithorax, which has the appearance more likely of layering pleural fluid. 
 Underlying airspace diseas such as aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded
 on this limited examination.  Clinical correlation is advised to help explain
 the apparent increase in left pleural effusion and left airspace disease.  The
 visualized right lung appears grossly clear.  No pneumothorax is seen.  A
 right internal jugular central line remains in position with its tip in the
 distal SVC.  No pneumothorax.
