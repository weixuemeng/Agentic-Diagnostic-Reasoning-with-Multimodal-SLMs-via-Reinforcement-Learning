                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ at 14:52.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory distress status post
 intubation.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 11:08.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 14:52 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval intubation with placement of an endotracheal tube that lies 2 cm
 above carina.  The right internal jugular central line continues to have its
 tip in the distal SVC.  The patient is markedly rotated to the left and there
 is complete opacification of the left hemithorax which limits evaluation of
 the cardiac and mediastinal contours.  There is an abrupt cutoff of the left
 mainstem bronchus which raises the possibility of a mucus plug.  A large
 pleural effusion or pulmonary hemorrhage with collapse of the left lung could
 also have this imaging appearance.  Results of this study were discussed with
 ___, the patient's nurse, as well as ___, the patient's housestaff on
 ___ by phone at 4:20 p.m.  The right lung is clear with the exception of
 patchy opacity at the base which could reflect an area of atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax.  Spinal hardware is again seen obscuring the midline.
