 pneumonia/acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is
 obscuration of the right heart border raising concern for a opacity within the
 right middle lobe although this could possibly be due to patient positioning. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Note is made of multiple small
 biopsy clips overlying the right breast.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtly increased opacity projecting in the region of the right middle lobe
 which may represent infection in the appropriate clinical setting. Clinical
 correlation is recommended.
