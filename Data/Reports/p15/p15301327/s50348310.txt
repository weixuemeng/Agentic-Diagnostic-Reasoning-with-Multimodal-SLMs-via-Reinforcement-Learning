                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shallow views requested for opacification in right lung
 projecting over the fifth rib, unclear if pulmonary vs. osseous lesion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Shallow oblique views were obtained re-demonstrating punctate
 opacity in the right lower lung, which appears to be within the pulmonary
 parenchyma and likely represents crossing vessels or possibly a partially
 calcified granuloma.  Otherwise, unchanged exam with normal cardiomediastinal
 and hilar borders.  Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
