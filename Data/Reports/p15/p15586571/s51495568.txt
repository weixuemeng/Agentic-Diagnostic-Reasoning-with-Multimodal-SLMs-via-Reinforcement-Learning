                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with presumed PNA now with increased work of
 breathing  // e/o worsening PNA, effusion, other acute process changed from
 prior CXR      e/o worsening PNA, effusion, other acute process changed from
 prior CXR
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette remains at
 the upper limits of normal in size.  Again there is prominence of interstitial
 markings, less striking than on the previous study, most likely reflecting
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, superimposed pneumonia would certainly have to be considered.
 Right subclavian PICC line again extends to the level of the cavoatrial
 junction.
