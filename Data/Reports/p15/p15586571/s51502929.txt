                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M NSCE tachypneic desatting to high 80s on 4L NC with wheezing
 and poor air entry  // eval for acute pulmonary process
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___ at 11:19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are diffuse increased interstitial markings.  Opacities in left mid
 and lower and right infrahilar regions are more confluent on this exam,
 possibly somewhat accentuated by technical differences.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly unchanged.  The aorta is again noted to be densely
 calcified.  The azygos vein is dilated, measuring 18 mm, slightly increased
 compared with the prior study and suggestive of right heart failure.  No gross
 effusions are identified.  No pneumothorax is detected .  Catheter/ tubing
 again noted over the upper abdomen immediately to the left of midline.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse interstitial opacities in both lungs, with more confluent areas in the
 left mid/ lower and right infrahilar regions.  The areas of confluence are
 slightly more pronounced than on the prior study.  The appearance is
 concerning for infectious infiltrates.  The possibility of developing
 pulmonary edema cannot be entirely excluded, but is considered less likely in
 the absence of significant pleural effusion.
