                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with chest pain and shortness of breath, evaluate for
 pneumonia or effusions.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PET-CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Again seen are innumerable bilateral small
 pulmonary nodules consistent with extensive metastatic non-small cell lung
 cancer without significant change.  Heart size is normal and there is no
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There is no obvious, large
 consolidations to suggest pneumonia.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
