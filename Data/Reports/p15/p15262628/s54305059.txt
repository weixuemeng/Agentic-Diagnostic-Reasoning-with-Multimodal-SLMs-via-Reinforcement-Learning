                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AMS  // eval for infection/mass
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, earlier today, at 02:01
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lateral view is suboptimal due to patient's overlying arm and
 underpenetration.  Patchy basilar opacities are seen which could relate to
 pulmonary vascular congestion or infection or aspiration depending on the
 clinical scenario.  No large pleural effusions are seen.  There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy basilar opacities with perihilar prominence could be due to vascular
 congestion or infection or aspiration depending on the clinical scenario. 
 Mild cardiomegaly.  No pleural effusion.
