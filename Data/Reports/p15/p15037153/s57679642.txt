                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male, intubated status post seizure.  Evaluation for
 tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 AP SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The endotracheal tube terminates 4.5 cm
 from the carina.  Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip in
 the stomach.  However, the side port of nasogastric tube is above the
 diaphragm.  Advancement is recommended.  The lungs are clear.  There is no
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is no vascular congestion or
 pleural effusions.  There is apparent mediastinal widening which is more than
 what would be expected despite the supine portable technique.  Findings may
 reflect underlying adenopathy or mediastinal pathology, recommend dedicated PA
 and lateral chest radiograph for further evaluation when clinically stable. 
 The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Standard position of endotracheal tube 4.5 cm from the carina.
 
 2.  Nasogastric tube within the stomach, though side port above the left
 hemidiaphragm, and advancement is recommended.
 
 3.  Mediastinal widening, partly due to the AP technique though is concerning
 for underlying mediastinal pathology.  Recommend dedicated PA and lateral
 chest radiographs or chest CT for further characterization.
