 junction.  Multiple nodular opacities in the right mid lung are consistent
 with the patient's known pulmonary metastases.  There is left basilar opacity
 which may represent a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Left
 basilar scarring is unchanged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 No pneumothorax is present.  No free air is seen below the left hemidiaphragm.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
