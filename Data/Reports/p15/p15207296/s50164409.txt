                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man S/P CARDIAC ARREST.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from the same day, dated ___ at 11:00 AM.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of an ETT, with the tip approximately 4.5 cm from the
 carina. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube, which traverses the
 diaphragm and ends in the stomach with the side hole just distal to the
 gastroesophageal junction.
 
 The lungs are hyper-expanded.  Increased opacity in the left lower lung with
 silhouetting of the lateral border of the descending aorta but preservation of
 air bronchograms, new since the exam earlier on the same day. Right basilar
 atelectasis. No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours as well as hila and pleura are unchanged.
 
 Incidental interposition of the colon between the right hemidiaphragm and
 liver.  No sub-diaphragmatic intra-abdominal free air.  No acute osseous
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New increased opacity with silhouetting of the lateral border of the
 descending aorta, suggestive of a consolidation in the retrocardiac region,
 which in the appropriate setting may represent an acute pneumonia.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with ___ from
 the CCU team on the telephone on ___ at 9:47 AM, 3 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
