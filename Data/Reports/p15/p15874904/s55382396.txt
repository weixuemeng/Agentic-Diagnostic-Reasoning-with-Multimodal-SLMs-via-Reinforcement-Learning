                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Neutropenic fever with elevated bilirubin.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___, bone scan ___, chest
 radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Study is somewhat limited by low lung volumes and lordotic
 positioning.  Indistinct consolidations in the left lower lobe worrisome for
 infection and perhaps a small effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size
 appears normal.  There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath and the tip is in
 appropriate location.  Surgical clips are seen projecting over the right
 axilla.  Diffuse sclerotic lesions are seen throughout the bony structures and
 is compatible with known osseous metastases.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Left lower lobe consolidations with probable effusion worrisome for
 infection.
 2. Diffuse sclerotic bone lesions compatible with known metastases.
