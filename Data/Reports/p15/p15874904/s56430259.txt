                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube has been placed and terminates in the mid
 portion of the trachea.  An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  A
 Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium.  Although the left lung base is
 much better aerated than before, there is, if anything, more extensive diffuse
 but heterogeneous bilateral lung opacification elsewhere, worrisome for a
 rapidly developing infectious process or perhaps pulmonary edema.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bilateral ureteral stents are
 present.  Diffuse bony sclerosis suggests metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.  Increasing multifocal
 bilateral lung opacification, although with better aeration specifically at
 the left lung base.
