                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with multiple myeloma and productive cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 imaging:
 
 Findings are equivocal regarding the possibility of a small basal pneumonia,
 seen on the lateral view projected over the descending aorta.  I would
 recommend oblique views to see if this is a real finding.  Upper lungs are
 clear.  Heart is mildly enlarged, but there is no vascular plethora or edema
 or significant pleural effusion.
