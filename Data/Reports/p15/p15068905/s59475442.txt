                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo Mw/ hx of metastatic adenocarcinoma of unclear source  npw
 s/p T8-L4 decompression and fusion who remains intubated  // assess ETT,
 assess for pulmonary cause of resp failure     assess ETT, assess for
 pulmonary cause of resp failure
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is an placement of an
 endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5.2 cm above the carina. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No change in the
 multiple nodular opacifications throughout both lungs, much better seen on the
 recent CT scan and consistent with nodular metastases.  Opacification at the
 left base most likely represents atelectatic changes and possible small E
 fusion.
