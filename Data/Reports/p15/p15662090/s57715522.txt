                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man w/ urosepsis, recent intubation, ?multifocal
 infiltrates on prior, now s/p antibiotic narrowing for urine organism, fever
 after normal temp x 2 days  // evaluate interval increase in infiltrates   
 evaluate interval increase in infiltrates
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___, there is little overall change in
 the diffuse bilateral areas of opacification consistent with the clinical
 diagnosis of multifocal pneumonia.  The medial aspect of the left
 hemidiaphragm is not seen, suggesting some volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 Some of the generalized opacification could well represent some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure as well as bilateral pleural effusions.
