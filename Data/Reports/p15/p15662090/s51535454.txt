                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe sepsis ___ urinary source intubated
 for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  // ? interval change in bilateral lower
 lobe consolidations.
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive bibasilar consolidation developed between ___ and ___,
 could be bilateral pneumonia or some component of atelectasis, in any case
 pointing to possible interval aspiration.
 
 Since ___ heterogeneous consolidation in the right lung has remained
 relatively stable, but there is much more consolidation in the left midlung
 and no improvement in the lower lobe. Findings suggest widespread pneumonia in
 both lungs.  Heart is normal size but larger and mediastinal veins are
 distended indicating volume overload or biventricular heart failure as well. 
 Mild pulmonary edema would be difficult to appreciate independent of the
 pneumonia.
 
 Left PIC line ends low in the SVC. ET tube standard placement, and a
 nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view
