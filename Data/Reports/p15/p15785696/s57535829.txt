                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-a-Cath terminates in the mid superior vena cava.  The heart
 is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal
 limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky opacities at
 each medial lung base are not necessarily due to pneumonia.  Airway
 inflammation or atelectasis could yield this appearance.  Chronicity is
 uncertain since no prior studies are available to compare; short-term
 follow-up radiographs may be helpful if symptoms were to persist.
