                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with GIST of pylorus s/p distal gastrectomy
 /proximal duodenectomy with gastrojejunostomy, primary repair of duodenectomy 
 // Eval for PNA/Aspiration
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 structures.  Patchy bibasilar opacities are probably due to atelectasis in the
 immediate postoperative setting.  Aspiration is an additional consideration.
