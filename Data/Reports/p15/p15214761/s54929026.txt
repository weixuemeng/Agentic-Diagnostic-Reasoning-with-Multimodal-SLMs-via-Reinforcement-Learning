 Nasogastric tube ends in the distal stomach.  Lung volumes are appreciably
 lower now than on ___, and it is difficult to distinguish vascular
 crowding and atelectasis at the lung bases from aspiration.  Low lung volumes
 exaggerate caliber of the mediastinum, due to tortuous thoracic aorta and
 possibly distended mediastinal veins.  Heart size is normal.  Pleural effusion
 is minimal, if any.  No pneumothorax.
