                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dementia, unwitnessed falls
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Scarring within the lung apices is re- demonstrated along with lung
 hyperinflation.  There are new small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on
 the left, with associated bibasilar patchy atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is
 not identified.  Smooth curvilinear opacity projecting over the left upper
 chest is unchanged, likely reflective of overlying soft tissues.  There are
 mild to moderate degenerative changes again seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left, with bibasilar
 atelectasis.
