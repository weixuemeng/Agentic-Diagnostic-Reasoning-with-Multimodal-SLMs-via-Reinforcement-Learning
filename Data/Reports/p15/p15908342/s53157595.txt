 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Gastrointestinal bleeding.

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appears unchanged.  A smooth
 partly visualized shadow projecting over the left upper chest is unchanged and
 appears to represent a stable contour associated with overlying soft tissues. 
 There is similar mild pleural thickening at each lung apex.  Otherwise, the
 lung fields appear clear.  The chest is hyperinflated.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones appear demineralized.  Similar mild to
 moderate degenerative changes affect the mid through lower thoracic spine.
