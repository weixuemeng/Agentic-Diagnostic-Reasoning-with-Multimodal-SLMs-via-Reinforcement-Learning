                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, lethargy and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Calcification of the aorta is
 again noted.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Minimal linear opacities are noted within the
 lung bases, which could reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles
 posteriorly may suggest the presence of tiny bilateral pleural effusions. 
 There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis and possible minimal bilateral pleural effusions.
