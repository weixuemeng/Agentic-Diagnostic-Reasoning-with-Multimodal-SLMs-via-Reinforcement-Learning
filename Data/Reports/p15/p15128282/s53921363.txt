                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post esophagectomy, now with cough and
 fatigue, here to evaluate for interval change or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show decreased size of
 small left pleural effusion from ___ with persistent atelectasis of the
 left lung base, improved from the preceding radiograph.  There is persistent
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle with improved aeration in the right
 lung base consistent with decreased size of small right pleural effusion.  The
 lungs are otherwise well aerated without focal consolidation or pneumothorax. 
 A large air-fluid level is seen in the neoesophagus along its course in the
 right paramediastinal region in the posterior right hemithorax.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and unchanged from the
 preceding radiograph.  A left pectoral Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position
 with the tip terminating in the cavoatrial junction.  A wedge compression
 fracture deformity of the mid thoracic spine is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Decreased size of small bilateral pleural effusions with improved aeration
 at both lung bases and persistent mild atelectasis.  
 2.  Large air-fluid level in the neoesophagus.
