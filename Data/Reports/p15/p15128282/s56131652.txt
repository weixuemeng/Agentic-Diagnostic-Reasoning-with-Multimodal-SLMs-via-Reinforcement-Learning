 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with esophageal cancer status post
 esophagectomy, now with nasogastric tube placement.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 726.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which is in satisfactory position
 in this patient status post esophagectomy.  Right chest tube remains in place.
 Left subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the distal SVC. 
 There are patchy opacities at both bases and blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle unchanged but possibly reflecting bibasilar atelectasis, although
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours stable.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
