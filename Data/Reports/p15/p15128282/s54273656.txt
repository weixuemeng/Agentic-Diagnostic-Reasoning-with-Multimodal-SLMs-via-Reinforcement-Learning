                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post minimally invasive esophagectomy,
 now with new back pain, here to evaluate for interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___ with
 multiple prior studies during this admission from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left-sided Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position with the tip in
 the proximal right atrium.  The right apical chest tube has been removed since
 the preceding radiograph.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged
 from the prior study.  Residual barium from concurrent esophagram is noted in
 the neoesophagus in the right hemithorax in its paramediastinal course.  A
 dilated collection of barium is seen below the right hemidiaphragm with an
 apparent focal narrowing distally, which is better seen on recent esophagram. 
 No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.
