                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 11:52
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old postop day three from esophagogastrectomy
 for esophageal cancer, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study ___ at 20:56.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 11:52 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube remains unchanged in position.  Right chest tube also
 remains in place, unchanged.  A left subclavian central line has its tip in
 the distal SVC, unchanged.  There continues to be a small left effusion with
 associated air space opacity most likely representing compressive atelectasis.
 Bibasilar opacity is also again seen likely representing a combination of
 postoperative changes and atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
