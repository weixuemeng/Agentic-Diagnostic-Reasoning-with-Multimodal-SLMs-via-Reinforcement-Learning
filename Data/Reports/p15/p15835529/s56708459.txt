                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New-onset AFib, cirrhosis, thyrotoxicosis and question tracheal
 deviation and air-fluid level seen on previous chest x-ray.  Investigate
 air-fluid level seen on prior chest x-ray.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:   The previously questioned air-fluid level adjacent to the trachea
 is not present on this view, and may have been artifactual. Posterior
 indentation of the tracheal air column could be due to thyroid enlargement. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  A right-sided PICC line ends in the upper
 SVC is noted.  The lungs are clear, and there is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The vascular pattern suggests emphysema.  Dystrophic
 calcifications in the left axilla are chronic, probably nodal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Previously seen paratracheal air-fluid collection not seen on this study,
 probably artifactual.  Thyroid enlargement probably indenting the posterior
 trachea.
 
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged.
