                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M hx HCV cirrhosis, sigmoid colectomy   divert ileostomy(___)
 for perforated diverticulitis s/p ileostomy reversal(___) w/ acute
 encephalopathy and Bacteroides/GNR bacteremia, and new onset a-fib (responsive
 to dilt gtt). Currently in respiratory failure likely ___ ARDS, renal failure,
 and septic shock  // Increasing hypercapnea, please evaluate for interval
 changes  Increasing hypercapnea, please evaluate for interval changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Again there is some enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with bilateral pulmonary opacifications most likely
 representing pulmonary edema.  Again, in the appropriate clinical setting, it
 would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the
 absence of a lateral view.
