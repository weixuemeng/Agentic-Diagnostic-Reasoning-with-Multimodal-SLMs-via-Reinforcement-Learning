                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M hx HCV cirrhosis, sigmoid colectomy divert ileostomy(___)
 for perforated diverticulitis s/p ileostomy reversal(___) w/ acute
 encephalopathy and VRE/GNR bacteremia, and resolved a-fib on diltiazem s/p
 bronchoscopy // interval change after bronchoscopy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable, semi upright radiograph view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier on the same day, dated ___ at 05:10.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ETT in standard position.  Left internal jugular venous catheter tip projects
 over the expected region of the right atrium, unchanged.  Enteric tubes
 traverse the midline into the left upper quadrant 0, beyond the scope of this
 image.  Right pigtail catheter projects over the lower right hemithorax and
 appears slightly kinked.
 
 Bilateral airspace opacities, more confluent in the left and also in the right
 lower lobe are overall minimally changed from the prior exam, consistent with
 history of ARDS and concurrent right lower lobe pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is overall unchanged. No effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change other than possible kinked appearance of
 pigtail catheter.
