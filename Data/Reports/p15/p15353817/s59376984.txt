                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with free air in his abdomen, now with dyspnea 
 // cardipulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been progression of the right-sided airspace opacity, this is
 bilateral but asymmetric.  Given a predominately perihilar distribution, this
 is likely due to pulmonary edema.  The heart is not grossly enlarged, within
 the limits of the projection technique.  There is likely a small right-sided
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax seen.  A right-sided internal jugular
 catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  A nasogastric tube is in-situ, the tip is
 not visualized lies below the left hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased bilateral airspace opacities, greater on the right than the left
 likely reflecting asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Infection cannot be excluded.
