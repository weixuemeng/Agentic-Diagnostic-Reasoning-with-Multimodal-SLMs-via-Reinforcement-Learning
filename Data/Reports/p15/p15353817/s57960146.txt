                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new onset shortness of breath  //
 consolidation, edema      consolidation, edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the right subclavian catheter, with its tip in the right atrium
 about 2.5 cm below the cavoatrial junction.  The cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged.  There is increasing pulmonary edema with hazy opacification at the
 right base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with layering pleural
 effusion and compressive basilar atelectasis.
 Areas of more coalescent opacification, especially in the right upper zone,
 would raise the possibility of superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
