                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man w. liver failure s/p sigmoidectomy and loop
 ileostomy  // interval change      interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been
 removed.  Right IJ catheter tip is probably at the cavoatrial junction.
 Again there are low lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of
 the heart.  Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Bibasilar atelectatic changes are
 again seen with blunting of the left costophrenic angle that could represent
 some pleural fluid.
