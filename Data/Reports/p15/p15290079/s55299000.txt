                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with nausea, abdominal RLQ  tenderness to palpation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains unchanged, appearing moderately enlarged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar with atherosclerotic calcifications
 noted at the aortic knob.  Mild pulmonary edema is re- demonstrated.  Moderate
 to large right and moderate left layering bilateral pleural effusions are
 present, not substantially changed a interval, with associated bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Additionally, bronchiectasis with wall thickening is noted in
 the left lung base.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate to large right and moderate left bilateral layering pleural
 effusions, not substantially changed in size from the previous study with
 associated bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. Moderate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema, also similar to prior.
 3. Left basilar bronchiectasis with airway wall thickening suggestive of
 inflammation or infection.
