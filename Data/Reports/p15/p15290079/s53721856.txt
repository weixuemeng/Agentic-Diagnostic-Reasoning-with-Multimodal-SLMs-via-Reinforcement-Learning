  1. Moderate central vascular congestion with mild pulmonary edema and moderate
  bilateral layering pleural effusions, overall similar from prior study.
  2. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
  3. Bibasilar airspace opacities, predominantly in the lower lobes, are most
  consistent with compressive atelectasis.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 3:17 PM
  
  1. Moderate central vascular congestion with mild pulmonary edema and moderate
  bilateral layering pleural effusions, minimally improved from prior study.
  2. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
  3. Bibasilar airspace opacities, predominantly in the lower lobes, are most
  consistent with compressive atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with tachycardia, afib, chest pain  // ?cpd
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with radiograph from ___, moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  There is moderate central vascular congestion with mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema, similar compared to most recent prior. 
 Bilateral moderate layering effusions, right greater than left, are also
 similar.  Bilateral airspace opacities, predominantly in the lower lobes,
 likely reflect atelectasis.  No new focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate central vascular congestion with mild pulmonary edema and moderate
 bilateral layering pleural effusions, overall similar from prior study.
 2. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
 3. Bibasilar airspace opacities, predominantly in the lower lobes, are most
 consistent with compressive atelectasis.
