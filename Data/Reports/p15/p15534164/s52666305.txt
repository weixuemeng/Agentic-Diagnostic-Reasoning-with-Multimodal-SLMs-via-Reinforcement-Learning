 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is further
 engorgement of pulmonary vessels consistent with increasing pulmonary venous
 pressure.  Worsening opacification is seen in the left mid and lower zones,
 consistent with a combination of pleural fluid, atelectasis, and probable
 pneumonia.  The opacification in the right mid zone is decreasing.
