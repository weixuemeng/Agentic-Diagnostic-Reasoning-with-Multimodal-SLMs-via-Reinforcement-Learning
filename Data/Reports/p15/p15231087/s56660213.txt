                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weight gain, dyspnea, rule out CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending to the expected locations of
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  Patient is status post median
 sternotomy.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is again seen.  Relative slightly more
 confluent opacity projecting over the right lower lung most likely relates to
 prominent vascular structures rather than infection.  A trace left pleural
 effusion is difficult to exclude, however, there is no large pleural effusion.
 No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Old right-sided rib fractures with
 pleural thickening are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent cardiomegaly and mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema
 which appears increased as compared to the prior study.  Relative more
 confluent opacity at the right lung base most likely relates to confluence of
 vascular structures; however, an underlying infectious process is not excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
