  Bilateral lower lobe opacities concerning for aspiration pneumonitis versus
  multifocal pneumonia.  Likely small bilateral pleural effusions.  Moderate
  cardiomegaly, as before.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, sputum, respiratory distress.  Evaluate for pneumonia or
 CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  A left
 pacemaker with right atrial and right ventricular leads is again noted,
 unchanged in position.  There are bilateral mid-to-lower lobe hazy opacities,
 most consistent with mild-to-moderate alveolar pulmonary edema.  The upper
 portions of the lungs are clear.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 likely.  Moderate cardiomegaly is not significantly changed.  The mediastinal
 contours are stable.  The patient is status post midline sternotomy and CABG. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Old right posterolateral rib fractures are again
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild-to-moderate alveolar pulmonary edema.  Given that a concomitant
 bibasilar infectious process cannot be excluded, post-diuresis radiographs are
 recommended.
 2.  Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, not significantly changed.
