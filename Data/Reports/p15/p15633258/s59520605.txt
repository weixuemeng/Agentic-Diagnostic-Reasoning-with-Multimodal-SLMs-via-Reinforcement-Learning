                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the right chest tube has been
 removed.  No definite evidence of pneumothorax, though the chin of the patient
 obscures a portion of the right apical region.
 
 All of the other monitoring and support devices have been removed except for
 the left chest tube.  There are somewhat lower lung volumes.
