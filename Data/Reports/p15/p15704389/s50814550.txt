                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.  Metastatic esophageal cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest, ___, chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. 
 There is increased right perihilar density with lobular lucencies which
 correspond to previously identified subpleural consolidation with adjacent
 cavitation in the posterior right lower lobe.  A 2.8 cm nodular opacity in the
 right lower lobe appears increased in size compared to prior CT.  A 7-mm
 nodule in the left mid lung field and another 8-mm nodule in the AP window
 correspond to nodules previously identified on CT.  There is no focal
 consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Irregular area of increased density with adjacent lucency in the right
 perihilar space corresponding to a previously identified cavitary metastatic
 lesion on prior CT.  
 2.  A 2.8 cm right lower lobe nodule appears increased in size compared to
 prior CT.  Left lung nodules are better characterized on recent prior CT
 examination.  
 3.  No new focal consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.
