                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right upper lobectomy, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from earlier the same day, ___ at  6:50 a.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, there has been partial reexpansion of the right
 lung.  A relatively large apical pneumothorax remains present, but it is
 significantly smaller than on the earlier film.  There has been some
 improvement in the right lung atelectasis.  Possible slight increase in
 right-sided subcutaneous emphysema.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval
 change.  Mediastinum remains midline.
