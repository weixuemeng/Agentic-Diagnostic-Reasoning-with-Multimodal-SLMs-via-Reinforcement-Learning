                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right upper lobectomy, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 11:06 a.m., the size of the pneumothorax is
 unchanged.  Two right-sided chest tubes are again seen.  However, on the
 current exam, there is more pronounced opacity in the right lung, medially,
 with more patchy opacity at the right base and coarser appearance of the
 vascular markings.  Is there a reason to suspect re-expansion edema? 
 Differential diagnosis could include changes due to atelectasis --  if so
 these are more pronounced than on the film from ___ at 6:50 when the
 pneumothorax was larger.  Subcutaneous emphysema along the right chest wall
 again noted.
 
 At the left lung base, the patchy retrocardiac opacity appears very slightly
 worse. the small left effusion is probably unchanged.  Doubt left-sided CHF.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right apical pneumothorax, unchanged in size.  Chest tubes similar in
 distribution.
 
 2.  Increased opacity in the right lung.  Is there reason to suspect
 re-expansion edema?  Please see comment above.
