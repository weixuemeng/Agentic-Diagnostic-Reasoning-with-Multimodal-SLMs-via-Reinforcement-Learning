                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right lung cancer status post upper lobectomy, question interval
 change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Most recent prior chest x-rays on PACS is a preoperative film from ___.  
 
 On the current film, there is a large opacity in the right upper zone,
 extending from the right hilum into the right upper zone.  There is a probable
 small pneumothorax.  Chain sutures are noted at the right lung apex.  
 
 wo right-sided chest tubes are present.  A left-sided Port-A-Cath type tube is
 present, with tip over proximal SVC.  Linear wire-like density extending from
 the superior edge of the film along the right neck over the mediastinum may
 represent an epidural catheter -- clinical correlation is requested. 
 Subcutaneous emphysema is noted along the right chest wall and right neck.  
 
 Mediastinum remains midline, with mild cardiomegaly.  Left lung remains
 grossly clear, without CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion.  No right-sided
 effusion is detected.  No CHF or focal infiltrate in mid and lower right lung
 zones.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with prior right upper lobe lobectomy, with
 opacity extending from the right hilum and possible small right pneumothorax. 
 Evidence of right upper lobe volume loss noted, consistent with surgical
 procedure.
