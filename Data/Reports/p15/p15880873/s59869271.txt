                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Non-small cell lung cancer, status post right thoracotomy and
 right upper lobectomy, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right apical
 postoperative pneumothorax is unchanged in dimension.  However, a part of the
 pleural space is now also filled with air, causing a relatively large
 air-fluid level at the right lung apex.  The staple lines are in constant
 position.  Constant appearance of the remaining right postoperative lung and
 constant appearance of the left lung.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. 
 No evidence of left pleural effusion.
