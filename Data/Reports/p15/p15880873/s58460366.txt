                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right thoracotomy and right upper lobe lobectomy,
 evaluate change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 18:38 p.m., the right apical pneumothorax has
 increased in size.  Again seen is opacity extending from the right hilum to
 the upper edge of the right lung.  Some of this is accounted for by
 atelectasis/collapse, but the significance of the more medial density is
 uncertain and clinical correlation is therefore requested.  Surgical sutures
 again noted at the upper lung edge -- some of these have migrated inferiorly
 in the setting of the increased pneumothorax/lung collapse.  Again seen are
 two right-sided chest tubes, left-sided central line with tip over proximal
 SVC, and an apparent epidural catheter.  Minimal atelectasis at the right lung
 base.  Left lung remains grossly clear and the mediastinum is midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Interval increase in size of right pneumothorax, with partial collapse of
 the upper portion of the right lung.  
 
 2) Right hilar density again noted for which clinical correlation is
 requested.
 
 Please see separate report of film obtained at 6:50 am  ___.
