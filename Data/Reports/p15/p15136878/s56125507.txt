 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Bacteremia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ as well ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  Slight increase in the interstitial markings,
 more so at the lung bases could be artifactual, although atypical infection
 cannot be excluded.  No lobar consolidation is seen.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and
 unremarkable.
