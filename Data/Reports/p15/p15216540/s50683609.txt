                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with nsclc now w sob, pls evalf or pna or new tumor
 burden  // History: ___F with nsclc now w sob, pls evalf or pna or new tumor
 burden
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are innumerable pulmonary nodules are again seen throughout both lungs. 
 There is more confluent airspace opacity in the left ___-___ suprahilar
 regions including involving the left upper lung worrisome for pneumonia. 
 Additionally, there is tenting of the bilateral diaphragms left greater than
 right raising concern for atelectasis.  There may also be small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Cardiac silhouette is top-normal.
 
 Partially imaged abdomen demonstrates air distended loops of bowel, correlate
 clinically for possible underlying obstruction need for additional imaging.
