                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lung cancer, bilateral pleural effusions,
 pneumonia  // please evaluate for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since 1 day prior, left upper lung and right lower lung consolidations have
 increased in density.  Innumerable nodular opacities consistent with known
 metastasis appear relatively unchanged.  Lateral left pleural thickening is
 unchanged.  Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions are probably
 unchanged.  Heart size and cardiomediastinal silhouettes are inadequately
 evaluated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multifocal pneumonia superimposed on extensive metastatic disease.
