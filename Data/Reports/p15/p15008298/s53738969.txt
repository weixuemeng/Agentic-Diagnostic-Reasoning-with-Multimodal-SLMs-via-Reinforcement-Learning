                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever for five days, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild cardiomegaly.  A tortuous aorta with calcifications
 is present.  While there is increased opacities particularly at the left lung
 base on the frontal radiograph, no correlate is demonstrated on the lateral
 view therefore this most likely represents atelectasis, although pneumonia
 cannot be ruled out.  No pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is
 present. There are flattened diaphragms consistent with hyperinflation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacities, likely atelectasis, but pneumonia in the
 correct clinical setting should be considered.
