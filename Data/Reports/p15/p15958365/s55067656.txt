                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 11:59 P.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after ileostomy.  Fever.  Evaluate for atelectasis
 or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, pre-operative chest radiograph:
 
 Lung volumes are appreciably smaller, as one would expect after abdominal
 surgery, but the extent of opacification at the lung bases, particularly the
 right raises concern for aspiration pneumonia, rather than simply atelectasis.
 Close followup advised.  Pleural effusions are small if any.  No pneumothorax.
 Low lung volumes do exaggerate mild cardiomegaly.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.
