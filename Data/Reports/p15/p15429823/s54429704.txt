                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  COPD with hypoxemia, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and increased AP diameter,
 consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is a small right
 pleural effusion.  Additionally, patchy bibasilar opacities are seen, which
 could be due to pneumonia.  An additional a small patchy opacity is seen in
 the left mid lung zone which may also be post-infection; however, recommend
 followup chest radiograph or CT after antibiotic treatment to assess for
 resolution and exclude underlying pulmonary nodule, particularly in this
 patient with COPD.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar opacities and additional patchy left mid lung opacity raise
 concern for multifocal pneumonia.  Possible additional right mid lung opacity.
 Recommend followup chest radiograph or CT after appropriate antibiotic
 treatment to exclude underlying pulmonary nodule(s), particularly in this
 patient with COPD.
 2.  Small right pleural effusion.
