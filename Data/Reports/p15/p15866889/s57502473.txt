                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cardiac shock.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube ends approximately 3.8 cm from the carina.  A
 right internal jugular central line ends in the distal internal jugular vein. 
 A Swan-Ganz catheter from the femoral position ends in the proximal portion of
 right pulmonary artery.  An aortic balloon pump sits approximately 1.6 cm from
 the roof of the aortic arch and could be withdrawn slightly.  Sternal wires
 are intact.  Small new bilateral pleural effusions are present.  Moderate
 pulmonary edema is unchanged, and is more prominent on the right than the
 left, which is likely due to the patient's papillary muscle dysfunction. 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Balloon pump ends about 1.6 cm from the roof of the aortic arch and could
 be withdrawn slightly.
 2.  New small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Stable moderate pulmonary edema, worse on the right than the left.
