                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of endotracheal tube in standard position. 
 Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm but tip is not included on the
 radiograph.  Lung volumes are increased compared to the prior radiograph. 
 Heart size is normal.  Interval development of bilateral juxtahilar and
 basilar airspace opacities, which could be due to multifocal aspiration,
 likely coexisting with pulmonary edema, particularly given the presence of
 peripheral septal lines in the lower lobes.  Small-to-moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions are also present, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
