                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath after port placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 REPORT:
 
 A right-sided port is in good position.  Its tip lies in approximately mid
 SVC.  No good evidence of pneumothorax.  There is blunting of both
 costophrenic sulci.
 
 An unusual appearance of the right hilum is noted but this is likely vascular.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are suggested.
