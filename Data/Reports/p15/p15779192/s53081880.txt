                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable AP view the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes limits assessment as does multiple overlying wires. Patient
 is status post endotracheal tube placement which appears 5 cm above the level
 of the carina. An enteric tube traverses the thorax in an uncomplicated
 course.  The heart appears top-normal in size. Mediastinal contour appears
 normal. Mild hilar prominence with perihilar opacity could reflect
 bronchovascular crowding, possibly aspiration or atelectasis. There is no
 large pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.  Bony structures are grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET and enteric tube positioned appropriately. Perihilar opacities may reflect
 bronchovascular crowding versus aspiration versus atelectasis.
