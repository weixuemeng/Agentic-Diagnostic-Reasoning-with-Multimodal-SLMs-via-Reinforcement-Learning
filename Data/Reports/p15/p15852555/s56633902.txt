                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with R IJ placed at bedside confirmation of
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference chest radiograph ___ at 02:50
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. 
 Right-sided AICD device lead terminates in the right ventricle, unchanged. 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size remains
 moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is minimally improved.  There are persistent
 small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right.  More focal patchy
 opacities in lung bases may reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
 No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid
 SVC.  No pneumothorax.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, slightly improved.  Persistent small
 bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right.
 3. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, potentially atelectasis, but infection
 is not excluded.
