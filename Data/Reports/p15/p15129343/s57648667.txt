                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with bilateral pleural effusions and
 chronic cough. Examined to date with normal echo, LFT, kidney function,
 concern for underlying lung disease, assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is
 within normal limits.  No configurational abnormality is seen.  Mild widening
 and elongation of the thoracic aorta is noted, but no local contour
 abnormalities or wall calcifications are identified.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal
 infiltrates are present, and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are
 free.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.  The lateral view discloses a
 mildly accentuated kyphotic curvature in the thoracic spine, not excessive for
 patient's age and there is no evidence of vertebral body compression
 fractures.  In comparison with the next preceding chest examination of
 ___, the at that time described mild blunting of the lateral pleural
 sinuses is not present anymore.  An interesting observation is that on both
 lateral views, there was never any fluid accumulation in the posterior
 dependent pleural sinuses, thus free pleural effusion cannot be identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild widening and elongation of thoracic aorta possibly related
 to systemic hypertension but no evidence of CHF, pulmonary congestion, acute
 infiltrates or pleural effusion.
