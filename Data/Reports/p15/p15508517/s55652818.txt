                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p PPM  // r/o pneumo and lead placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 18:10, left base atelectasis is probably
 increased.  Poor delineation of the left costophrenic angle is new and could
 relate to atelectasis or small amount of pleural fluid.  Left ventricular
 silhouette is also slightly larger.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 The left-sided pacemaker is unchanged , with lead tips over right atrium and
 right ventricle.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
