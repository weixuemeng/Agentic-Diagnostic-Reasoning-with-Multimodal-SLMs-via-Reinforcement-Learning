                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with mucus plug status post intense pulmonary PT.
 Assess for re-expansion of the lung.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ as well as multiple priors.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph was provided.  A right PICC
 terminates in upper SVC.  Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into
 the stomach.  Again seen is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with
 minimal ipsilateral shift of the mediastinum.  This likely represents a
 combination of pleural effusion and volume loss.   This is unchanged in
 appearance to the prior study.  Right lung appears well aerated, however with
 moderate pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess.  The
 bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change in complete opacification of the left
 hemithorax, likely a combination of pleural effusion and volume loss. 
 Moderate pulmonary edema.
