                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the initial of two radiographs, a feeding tube is present with
 tip terminating at the expected location of the gastroesophageal junction.  On
 the second radiograph of the series, the tip is in a similar location, but
 there is now coiling of the tube more proximally overlying the upper cervical
 and oropharynx region.  Subsequent to this chest x-ray, a subsequent
 radiograph was performed with a persistent malpositioning, resulting in
 communication by telephone with Dr. ___ at 7:45 a.m. on ___ at
 time of discovery.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for partial collapse of the
 left lung with only a small amount of residual aerated lung in the left upper
 lobe, as well as an enlarging left pleural effusion, at least moderate in
 size.
