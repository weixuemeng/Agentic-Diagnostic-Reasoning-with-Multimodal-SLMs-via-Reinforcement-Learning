                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation cardiac arrest is tube position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 4.8 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube
 courses into the stomach.  A lucency over the left hemithorax suggests
 pneumothorax and correlation with soon-to-be obtained chest CT is recommended.
 Opacification of the right lung could reflect a combination of atelectasis
 and/or aspiration given the patient's history.  Extensive thoracic spine
 scoliosis with rod fixation is noted but incompletely assessed.  Cardiac size
 and cardiomediastinal contours are grossly normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Satisfactory tube position with left-sided pneumothorax and right-sided
 aspiration and/or extensive atelectasis.  
 
 Dr. ___ was paged by Dr. ___ at ___ on ___ 3 minutes after
 discovery and the finding was relayed upon return call at ___.
