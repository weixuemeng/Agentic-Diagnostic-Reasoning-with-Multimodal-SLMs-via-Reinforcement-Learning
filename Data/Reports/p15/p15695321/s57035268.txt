                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax post chest tube assess change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ from 2 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube, nasogastric and endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are
 in unchanged position.  Left apically directed right chest tube has been
 placed in the interval.  Persistent slight asymmetric lucency to the left
 chest wall is less apparent than on the previous study suggesting some
 improvement in pneumothorax.  A lenticular opacity projects over the left
 lateral chest wall.  This could reflect external skin, other external artifact
 or soft tissue; however pleural collection at the site of , although felt much
 less likely.  Retrocardiac and right lung opacities are similar in appearance
 to the previous examination.  Severe scoliosis and postsurgical changes are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Status post chest tube placement with likely decrease in
 pneumothorax though the exact extent is difficult to assess on this supine
 film.  Lenticular opacity over the left upper chest may be artifact from
 external structure/soft tissue, or other device vs unlikely possible pleural
 or chest wall hematoma at the site of chest tube insertion.
