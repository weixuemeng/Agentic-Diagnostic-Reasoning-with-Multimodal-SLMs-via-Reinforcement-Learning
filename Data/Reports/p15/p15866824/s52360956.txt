                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  Targeted review of a chest CT from
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is rotated positioning.  Allowing
 for this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged compared with
 ___.  Upper zone redistribution likely relates to low inspiratory
 volumes.  There is minimal atelectasis, somewhat patchy at the left base.  No
 definite infiltrate.  There is atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region,
 also without definite infiltrate.  Minimal blunting of both costophrenic
 angles, without gross effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis, with elevated right hemidiaphragm.  No
 definite infiltrate.  No gross effusion.
