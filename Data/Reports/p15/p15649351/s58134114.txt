                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear.  No effusion or pneumothorax is present.  A
 1-cm density adjacent to the right anterior first rib is most likely
 costochondral calcification but the presence of a pulmonary nodule in this
 region cannot be excluded.  Heart and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Equivocal right upper lung nodule most likely represents
 costochondral calcification.  A repeat radiograph in lordotic positioning may
 be helpful to better characterize.
