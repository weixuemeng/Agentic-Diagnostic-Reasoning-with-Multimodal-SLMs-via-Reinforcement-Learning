                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___ with AMS  // PNA? Effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Linear opacities in the left mid lung are not confirmed on the lateral and may
 be due to atelectasis. Elsewhere the lungs are essentially clear noting
 blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles, potentially due to small
 effusions. Cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. Atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the aortic arch. Flowing osteophytes seen in the
 vertebral bodies. No displaced fractures identified.
