                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with asthma, ?hypersensitivity eosinophilic
 cellulitis  // evaluate for acute cardiac process, infiltrate, vasculitis     
 evaluate for acute cardiac process, infiltrate, vasculitis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is
 no definite vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.
 In the right apical region, there is the vague suggestion of an elliptical
 opacification, which could merely represent overlapping shadows of pulmonary
 markings, fourth posterior rib, and lower portion of the medial clavicle.  An
 apical lordotic view is recommended to exclude the possibility of a true
 parenchymal lesion.
 There appear to be bilateral cervical ribs, more prominent on the right.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Apical lordotic view to exclude a right parenchymal
 process.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___, the intern taking care of the patient.
