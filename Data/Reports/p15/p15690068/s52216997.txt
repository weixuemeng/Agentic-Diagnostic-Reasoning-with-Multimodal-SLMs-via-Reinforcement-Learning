 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are stable.  There has been
 interval improvement of diffuse bilateral opacities, greater in the right
 upper lobe.  This could be due to improvement of pulmonary edema and
 hemorrhage.  There is no pneumothorax or large effusions.  Pacer leads are in
 standard position.  NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
