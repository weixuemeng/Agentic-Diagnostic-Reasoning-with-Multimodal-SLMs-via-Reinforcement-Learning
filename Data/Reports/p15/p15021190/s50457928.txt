                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Continued O2 requirement on postop day 2.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate bibasilar
 atelectasis with decreased lung volumes compared to the prior study. Small
 right pleural effusion is likely.  This accentuates the cardiac contour and
 pulmonary vasculature.  No acute consolidation is seen.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Of note, mild undulation in the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged since
 ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute infection.  Bibasilar atelectasis with
 decreased lung volumes and possible small right pleural effusion.
