                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia  // eval for PNA, CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are noted.  Right basilar opacity is likely secondary to
 atelectasis. Elsewhere, the lungs are clear. There is no large effusion or
 vascular congestion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 A linear radiopaque density with tip overlying the cervical spinal canal may
 be a spinal stimulator electrode.  No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable right basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise no evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
