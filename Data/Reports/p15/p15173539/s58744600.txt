                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  MVC at 30 miles per hour with pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine AP portable views of the chest were obtained.  Linear left
 basilar opacity likely represents atelectasis.  No definite focal
 consolidation is seen.  Rounded calcified opacity at the lateral right lung
 base is stable and may represent a calcified granuloma.  A radiopaque rounded
 structure projects over the right upper-to-mid hemithorax and may be external
 to the patient.  No large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is
 seen.  Left greater than right biapical pleural thickening is again seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No acute fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
