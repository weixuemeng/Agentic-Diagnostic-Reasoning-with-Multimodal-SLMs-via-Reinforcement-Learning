 of right pneumonia      resolution of right pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 better inspiration.  Features consistent with chronic pulmonary disease are
 again seen with prominence of interstitial markings and right upper lobe
 changes.  In the right cardiophrenic angle, the opacification could well be
 due to crowding of vessels and interstitial disease, rather than an acute
 focal consolidation.
