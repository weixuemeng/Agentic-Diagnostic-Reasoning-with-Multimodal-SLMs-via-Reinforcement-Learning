                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous exam. This accentuates the
 size of the cardiac silhouette which is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures. Patchy opacities within the lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes, but infection is not
 completely excluded. Consider repeat PA and lateral views when the patient is
 able to take a deeper inspiration to better assess the lung bases.
