                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with persistant cough and fatigue with cough >
 4 weeks.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes have decreased compared to prior.  Bibasilar patchy and linear
 opacities are likely due to atelectasis.  Heart size is within normal
 limits.Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no evidence
 for pulmonary edema, pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities, likely due to atelectasis.  If clinical suspicion for
 pneumonia persists, repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory level may be
 helpful for more complete assessment of the lung bases.
