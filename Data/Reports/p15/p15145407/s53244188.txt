 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again noted is moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis

 pulmonary vasculature suggestive of mild increase in central pulmonary venous
 pressure.  Otherwise, the lungs are without focal a consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  No acute fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little change in comparison to multiple prior recent studies with
 moderate cardiomegaly, retrocardiac atelectasis, mild pulmonary edema, and a
 small left pleural effusion.
