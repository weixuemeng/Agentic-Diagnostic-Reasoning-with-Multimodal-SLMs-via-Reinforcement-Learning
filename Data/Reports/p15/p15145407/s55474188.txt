 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged severe
 cardiomegaly, with a small left pleural effusion and a retrocardiac
 atelectasis.  On the right, there is no evidence of parenchymal pathologies,
 notably no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema, a minimal decrease in
 translucency of the right lung base as compared to the previous image is
 likely caused by patient rotation and overlying soft tissues.
