                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with dyspnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia or
 CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes
 are slightly low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  There is a small
 amount of left basilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is identified.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and
 hilar contours are normal allowing for lung volumes.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal left basilar atelectasis. Otherwise, no acute
 intrathoracic process.
