                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___ and ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  New onset left leg swelling, to assess for volume overload
 or cause of hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with upper lobe lucency and splaying of bronchovasculature which
 is compatible with underlying severe emphysema.  Increased diffuse
 mid-to-lower lung opacities could represent pulmonary edema or an atypical
 infection.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are also seen.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  Bony structures appear intact.  A
 compression deformity in the mid thoracic vertebra appears stable from the
 prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severe emphysema with diffuse irregular mid-to-lower lung
 opacities which could represent pulmonary edema versus infection.  Mild
 cardiomegaly and small bilateral effusions also noted.
