 The tip of the ET tube terminates in the mid trachea 5.2 cm above the carina. 
 A left IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  Asymmetric
 pulmonary edema is stable and more pronounced on the right.  Atelectasis is
 noted at the lung bases.  The cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions are presumed but not large and no bigger than previous
 studies.  There is no pneumothorax.  Visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 Surgical clips project over the thoracolumbar spine.
