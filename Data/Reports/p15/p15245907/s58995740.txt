 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 12:30 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There continues to be a layering left effusion with associated airspace
 opacity which likely reflects atelectasis. There is likely a smaller right
 effusion with linear and patchy opacities at the base also suggestive of
 atelectasis. Possible minimal to mild interstitial edema. Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely stable although difficult to assess due to the
 patient rotation on the current study.  No pneumothorax.
