 As compared to ___, endotracheal tube now terminates 7 cm above
 the carinal and could be advanced approximately 2 cm for standard positioning.

 opacities, most likely due to pulmonary edema although coexisting infection is
 possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Interval decrease in bilateral
 pleural effusions with residual small effusions remaining. No other relevant
 changes.
