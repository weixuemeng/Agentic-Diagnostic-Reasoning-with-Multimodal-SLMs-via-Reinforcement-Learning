                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to prior exam from
 ___ and CT torso from ___.  Again seen is eventration
 of the left hemidiaphragm.  Minimal residual right basilar opacity is
 identified which has improved since previous exam.  There are persistent
 increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs, right worse than left,
 without new consolidations.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 Surgical clips are seen in the left upper quadrant.  Osseous structures are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small residual right basilar region of consolidation potentially
 due to atelectasis, though infection is not completely excluded.  Persistently
 increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs, potentially related to
 chronic underlying lung disease, unchanged from prior.
