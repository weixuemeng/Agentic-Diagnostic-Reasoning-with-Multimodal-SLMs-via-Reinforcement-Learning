                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Confusion 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  Heart size is normal.  Some elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is
 seen, unchanged.  Tip projected over the gastroesophageal region.  The
 visualized osseous structures appear grossly normal.  No definitive acute
 cardiopulmonary finding is seen.  There appears to be gastrostomy tube noted
 anteriorly but this appears to be slightly altered in position from prior
 study.  I note from PACS that the patient has had an interval G-tube
 replacement.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary finding.  Little interval change from
 prior study.
