                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumonia. Evaluate evolving pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___, and ___.  PA lateral chest x-ray from ___.  CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph, there are new loculations of the moderate left
 pleural effusion, overlying the left upper lobe. The right upper lobe
 consolidation has slightly improved, although pneumonia can cavitate and
 produce a similar appearance.  A moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged.
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged, with persistent pulmonary edema.
 
 Unchanged tracheostomy tube in standard position and left PICC line in the
 upper right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Right upper lobe consolidation has slightly improved, although a cavitating
 pneumonia can produce a similar appearance. If clinical suspicion is high, CT
 of the chest is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 2. Bilateral pleural effusions, with new left upper lobe collections of
 loculated fluid.
