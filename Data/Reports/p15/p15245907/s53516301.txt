 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 543 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Assessment of cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult due to marked
 patient rotation on the current exam. The endotracheal tube is unchanged in
 position. Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC.
 There continue to be layering bilateral effusions with bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflecting compressive lower lobe atelectasis. In addition,
 there is more pronounced hazy opacity throughout both lungs which likely
 reflects worsening moderate pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
