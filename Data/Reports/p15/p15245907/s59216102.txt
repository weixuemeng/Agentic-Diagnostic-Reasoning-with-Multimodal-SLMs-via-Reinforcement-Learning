 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:07 PM
  Since the prior study, the patient has been intubated, with the endotracheal
  tube terminating 4.9 cm above the carina. There are persistent signs of mild
  decompensated congestive heart failure but atelectasis at the left lung base
  has improved with mechanical ventilation. The size of the effusion is likely
  unchanged and appears more diffuse due to supine positioning.
