                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP SUPINE CHEST FILM ___ AT 12:20 P.M.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post MVC with hypotension and bilateral chest
 tubes.  Assess for pneumothorax and interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to a portable trauma chest film from ___ at 2:18 a.m.
 
 A single portable supine chest film dated ___, 12:20 p.m. is submitted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian central line has its tip in the mid SVC.  Endotracheal
 tube has its tip 3.5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Left basilar chest tube
 unchanged in position.  A right basilar chest tube continues to have its side
 port within the chest wall outside of the pleural space.  Lung volumes remain
 low but no focal airspace consolidation is seen.  No large pneumothorax is
 seen on the supine film.  However, note that the sensitivity of detecting
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.
