                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:56 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man.  NG tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP view of the torso centered at the diaphragm shows a
 nasogastric tube ending in the upper stomach.  Top normal heart size is
 attributable to supine positioning and low volume inspiration, which suggested
 new opacification at the left lung base, probably atelectasis.  Tip of the
 endotracheal tube is seen at the upper margin of this study, which excludes
 the lung apices, in standard position.
