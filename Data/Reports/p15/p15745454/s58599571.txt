                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis with persistent fevers
 despite antibiotic therapy.  Evaluate for evidence of intrathoracic infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A 4-mm subpleural nodular opacity at the right lung apex could be
 focal scarring versus a tiny pulmonary nodule.  The lungs are otherwise clear.
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.  
 
 2.  4-mm nodular opacity at the right lung apex, non-specific in nature. 
 Recommended correlation to PPD skin test.
