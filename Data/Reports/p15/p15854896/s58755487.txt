                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with recurrent pneumonia, bilateral pleural
 effusions, history of radiation for lymphoma.  Evaluate possible pneumonia and
 volume of effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___, ___:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion unchanged since ___.  Pleural effusion
 had increased between ___ and ___.  Subsequent torso CT scan,
 covering the chest showed moderate non-hemorrhagic largely layering right
 pleural effusion and similar but smaller left pleural effusion.  Opacification
 in the right lower lobe is probably entirely atelectasis.  Perihilar radiation
 fibrosis is also present.  The regions of ground-glass opacity in the
 suprahilar upper lobe seen on that torso CT scan have subsequently nearly
 resolved, and previous small left pleural effusion is also nearly clear.
 
 Differential diagnosis includes atypical edema, or pulmonary drug reaction,
 less likely viral infection or pulmonary hemorrhage.
