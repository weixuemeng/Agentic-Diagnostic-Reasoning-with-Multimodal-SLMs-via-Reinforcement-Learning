                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:01 P.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath.  Assess pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is stable, small left pleural effusion has
 decreased since ___.  Irregular left perihilar opacification, new
 since ___, is stable over three days.  Similar appearance at the
 upper pole of the right hilus is due in part to vascular engorgement medial to
 a region of chronic scarring, probably containing some bronchiectasis. 
 Depending on clinical history, the suprahilar findings could be due to
 previous radiation in a patient who has a history of follicular lymphoma, and
 as recently as ___ had extensive central and axillary
 adenopathy.
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has increased since ___, consistent with cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.
 
 Considering the complexity of patient's clinical history and radiographic
 findings, I would not hesitate to evaluate the chest with CT scanning, and if
 there is any clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolus, CTA.  Dr. ___ was
 paged at 9:50 a.m and we discussed the findings by telephone at 9:55am.
