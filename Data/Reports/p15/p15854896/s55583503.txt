                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Lymphoma, postop care, now presenting with shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval development in small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions
 with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. 
 Additionally, there is area of opacity in the right upper lung which could be
 due to infection, aspiration, or even an underlying pulmonary lesion.  Slight
 prominence of the hila may be due to underlying minimal pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  The cardiac silhouette appears mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  Additional opacity in the right
 upper lung could be due to consolidation due to infection, aspiration. 
 However, underlying pulmonary mass is not excluded, most recent priors from
 ___.  Recommend followup to resolution after appropriate treatment.
