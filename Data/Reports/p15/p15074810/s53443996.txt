 pleural thickening. On the lateral projection the outline of a blood is noted
 projecting over the heart likely residing in the left lung base. No focal
 consolidation, large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact. No free air
 is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute findings.
