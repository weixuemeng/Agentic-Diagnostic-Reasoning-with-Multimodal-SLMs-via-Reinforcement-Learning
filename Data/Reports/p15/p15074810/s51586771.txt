                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Three days of COPD with three days history of
 increasing difficulty breathing, dry cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 slight blunting of the posterior costophrenic angle, similar compared to the
 prior study, which may be due to pleural thickening, less likely trace pleural
 effusions.  There are areas of bilateral scarring/atelectasis.  Slight
 prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature may be due to mild vascular
 engorgement.  No definite focal consolidation.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
