 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed in comparison with prior
 chest radiographs through ___ with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral lung volumes are low.  Lungs are now better aerated as
 compared to the prior radiograph from ___.  Pulmonary edema has
 resolved.  Bilateral increased lower lung opacities likely from lobar collapse
 and probable right middle lobe collapse is persisting.  Associated bilateral
 mild-to-moderate pleural effusions are similar.  Mild- to moderate-sized
 hiatal hernia is present.  Aorta is remarkable for moderate atherosclerotic
 calcification and mild tortuosity.  Heart size is normal.
