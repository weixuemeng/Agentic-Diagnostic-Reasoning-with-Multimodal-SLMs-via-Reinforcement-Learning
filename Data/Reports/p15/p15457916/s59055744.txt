                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate PICC placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  None.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a right
 PICC, which courses superiorly into the right internal jugular vein.  Lung
 volumes are low, resulting in increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette
 and bronchovascular crowding.  Allowing for this, heart size is likely normal.
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a right approach PICC, which courses superiorly and
 terminates in the right internal jugular vein.  Per the notes in the ED
 dashboard, the team is aware of the malpositioned PICC.
