                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bile leak and fluid overload after diuresis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from one day prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are again low in volume.  Right small-to-moderate pleural
 effusion is unchanged with slight interval decrease in degree of left pleural
 effusion.  Tip of right PICC is not well seen but appears to be in the distal
 SVC.  The cardiac silhouette is not well evaluated but appears mildly
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis with small-to-moderate right greater than
 left pleural effusions.  The left is minimally improved.
