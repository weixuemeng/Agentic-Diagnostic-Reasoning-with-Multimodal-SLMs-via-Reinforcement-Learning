                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness ckd  // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild to moderate cardiomegaly, slightly more pronounced than in
 ___.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, and diffuse vascular blurring, with
 possible faint Kerley B lines at the lung bases, consistent with CHF and
 interstitial edema.  There is bibasilar atelectasis and blunting of both
 costophrenic angles.
 
 The focal opacity in the left mid zone seen on ___ has probably
 resolved, though the presence of background interstitial edema could obscure a
 subtle residual infiltrate.
 
 Probable small (4.2 mm) calcified granuloma in the right mid lung, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly, slightly poor pronounced than in ___
 2. Upper zone redistribution with diffuse vascular plethora and vascular
 blurring.  The appearance is suggestive of CHF with interstitial edema, new
 compared with the prior study.
 3. Previously seen the left mid-zone opacity appears to have resolved.
