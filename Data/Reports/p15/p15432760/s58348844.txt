                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with reported left lower lobe pneumonia on
 ___, presenting with worsening symptoms.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  When compared to prior
 been no significant interval change.  Again seen is consolidation in the left
 lower lobe silhouetting the hemidiaphragm.  There is a similar degree of
 volume loss, with leftward shift of the mediastinum.  The right lung remains
 clear.  Atherosclerotic calcification is seen at the aortic arch. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess given silhouetting on the
 left.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Consolidation in the left lower lobe with at least some component
 of volume loss again suggestive of probable infection and component of
 atelectasis.  Repeat after treatment to document resolution and return to
 normal volume.  As previously suggested, CT scan is suggested to exclude an
 obstructing lesion if persistent atelectasis.
