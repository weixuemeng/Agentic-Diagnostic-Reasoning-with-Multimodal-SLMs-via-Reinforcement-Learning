                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after right VATS
 bullectomy.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right lung appears to be improved in aeration as compared to the prior
 study with resolution of post-surgical hematoma in the right upper lobe.  Left
 lung is hyperexpanded, including the known upper lung bulla.  Shift of the
 mediastinum to the right is unchanged.  No interval development of pleural
 effusion is present.
