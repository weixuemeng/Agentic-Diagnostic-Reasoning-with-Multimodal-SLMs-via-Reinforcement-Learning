                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:42 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with right thoracotomy.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to preoperative chest radiograph, ___,
 
 Atelectasis and chain suture in the right apex denote the site of today's
 bullectomy.  There is quite likely a small-to-moderate right pneumothorax,
 apical and medial.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion, two right
 pleural tubes in place, one oriented superiorly, the other inferiorly from
 lower lateral insertions.  Atelectasis at the left base, attributable in part
 to large left upper lobe bullae, has worsened appreciably.  Heart size normal.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 2:10 p.m. when the findings are recognized.
