                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 10:59
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post left lung surgery with history
 of PEs, now with erythema in the left upper quadrant.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 10:59, is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Overall, when compared to the prior study, there is no interval change in
 appearance of the lungs with persistent low lung volumes and parenchymal
 distortion with scarring and post-surgical changes noted in the right upper
 lung.  Focal airspace opacity seen at the left base may reflect a combination
 of pleural fluid and known fibrotic changes.  Bullous change at the right apex
 is stable.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the parenchymal
 abnormalities. No pneumothorax.
