                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest Radiograph p.a. - lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p left VATS bullectomy for bullous emphysema
 ___  // Interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing large left
 parenchymal opacity has completely cleared.  The left lung base continues to
 show elevation of the left hemidiaphragm as well as a minimal pleural scarring
 limited to the location of the left costophrenic sinus.  The postoperative
 right apical changes are constant in appearance.  The lung volumes have
 increased, presumingly as a consequence of improved ventilation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Complete resolution of a pre-existing left lower lobe pneumonia.  Reduction in
 extent of a pre-existing left pleural effusion.
