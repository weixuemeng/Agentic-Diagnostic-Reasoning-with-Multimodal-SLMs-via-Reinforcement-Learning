                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and fever. Non-small cell lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ from ___
 ___.  CT torso ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Since the prior chest radiograph,
 there has been interval worsening of the left upper lobe/perihilar mass, which
 appears increased in size when compared to the prior study.  Heart size is
 difficult to assess given the presence of the perihilar mass.  A moderate
 left-sided pleural effusion is new when compared to the prior chest
 radiograph, with evidence of mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Left basilar
 consolidative opacity likely reflects atelectasis. No pneumothorax is
 identified.  Mild emphysematous changes are seen within the lung apices. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased size of left upper lobe/perihilar mass compatible with
 known malignancy.  Moderate-sized left pleural effusion with left basilar
 opacity likely reflecting atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
