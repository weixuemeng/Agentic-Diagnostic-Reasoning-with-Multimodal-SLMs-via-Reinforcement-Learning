                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hemoptysis and known underlying tracheal
 malignancy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Rising infection
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to the prior examination, there has been minimal interval change.
 Redemonstrated is right-sided volume loss with streaky linear opacities in the
 right upper lobe which may represent scarring or atelectasis. Similarly,
 bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflect atelectasis. Pleural thickening is
 seen at the right lung apex, and pleural calcification is seen adjacent to the
 right lower lobe. There is no overt pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema. The aorta is tortuous. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 otherwise stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent right upper lobe linear opacities, largely unchanged from the
 prior several examinations. Findings may reflect bronchiectasis, scarring, due
 to prior tuberculosis or remote necrotizing pneumonia.
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left.
 3.  Trachea is not fully imaged on this study. Left lower. Tracheal wall does
 appear irregular
