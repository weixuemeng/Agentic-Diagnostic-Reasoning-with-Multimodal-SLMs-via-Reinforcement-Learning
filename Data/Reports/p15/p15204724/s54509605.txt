  Scarring and bronchiectasis in the right upper lobe with right sided volume
  loss.  Superimposed acute process or underlying mass lesion would be difficult
  to exclude in the absence of priors documenting stability.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with hemoptysis  // evidence of infection or fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided volume loss is noted. Linear opacities in the right upper lobe may
 represent scarring and or bronchiectasis. Linear opacities at the right lung
 base may represent atelectasis or scar. There is pleural thickening along the
 right lung apex and lower lung which could be calcified as well as prominent
 extrapleural fat. There is no pneumothorax. The aorta is tortuous. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Scarring and bronchiectasis in the right upper lobe with right sided volume
 loss.  Superimposed acute process or underlying mass lesion would be difficult
 to exclude in the absence of priors documenting stability.
