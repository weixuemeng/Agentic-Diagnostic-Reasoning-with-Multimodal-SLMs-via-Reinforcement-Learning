                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p fall  // multiple rib fx, chest tube,
 ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 8.7 cm above the carina with the
 patient's head up, previously 7.5 cm, and should be advanced by 3-4 cm for
 optimal placement.  Enteric tube is in the stomach.  Left chest tube directed
 towards the apex is unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  The
 left lung is better aerated; however, diffuse heterogeneous opacities in the
 left lung are relatively unchanged.  The right lung is clear. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Multiple fractures are better demonstrated
 on a subsequent CT from the same day.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Improved aeration of the left lung with persistent heterogeneous opacities,
 possibly representing contusion in the setting of trauma.
 
 2.  Endotracheal tube is too high and should be advanced by no more than 4 cm.
