                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left chest tube to water seal s/p
 hemo/pneumo  // water seal CXR. eval for pneumo/hemo
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tracheostomy tube is in appropriate position. Compared to the prior study
 performed 11 hours prior, there is increase in consolidation in the right
 lower lobe and possibly more septic emboli throughout the right lung. There is
 increased left basilar atelectasis and the left pleural effusion has
 increased. There is a minimal amount of leftward shift of the mediastinum. No
 pneumothorax is identified. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Consolidation in the right lower lobe has increased compared to the prior
 radiograph performed 11 hours prior which raises the possibility of increasing
 septic emboli. Left basilar atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion have
 also increased.
