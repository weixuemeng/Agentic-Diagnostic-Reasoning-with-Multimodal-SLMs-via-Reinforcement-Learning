                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: Left chest wall pain after assault.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No rib
 fractures are identified. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable chest radiographic examination. Although no rib
 fractures are identified, this study has suboptimal sensitivity for detection
 of rib fractures. If there is further clinical concern dedicated rib views
 should be obtained.
