                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p cardiac arrest, hypoxemia  // eval for
 hypoxemia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.  CT chest from earlier
 same day ___ 16:29.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 5.2 cm above the carina.  Right IJ
 central venous catheter is seen with its tip in the mid SVC.  Esophageal
 enteric catheter is seen with its tip in the region of the gastric body. 
 Ovoid density projecting in the region of the gastric body likely represents
 enteric contrast from prior CT.
 
 There are low lung volumes bilaterally.  There are bilateral pleural
 effusions, with obscuration of the hemidiaphragms bilaterally, likely
 reflecting bibasilar atelectasis/pneumonitis.  No apical pneumothoraces are
 seen on this supine view.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is largely obscured by the low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis/pneumonitis.
 Lines and tubes as above.
 
  This preliminary report was reviewed with Dr. ___, ___
 radiologist.
