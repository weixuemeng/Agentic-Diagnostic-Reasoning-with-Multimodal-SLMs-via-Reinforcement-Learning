                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, hypotension  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is moderate to markedly enlarged.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic angles suggests small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is mild
 to moderate pulmonary edema.  No definite focal consolidation is seen although
 one would be difficult to exclude at the left lung base.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly, small pleural effusions, and pulmonary edema suggest CHF.
