                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke, to assess for pulmonary lesion.
 
 FINDINGS:  As on the study of ___, there is substantial enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with left ventricular prominence.  Tortuosity of the aorta
 is again seen in this patient with intact midline sternal wires after CABG
 procedure.  
 
 The left pleural effusion has cleared.  No pulmonary vascular congestion or
 acute pneumonia.
 
 The discordancy between cardiac size and pulmonary vascularity raises the
 possibility of cardiomyopathy.
