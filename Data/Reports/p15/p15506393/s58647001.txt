                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of left-sided pneumothorax, tube clamped, progression
 recurrence.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray at 22:47 p.m.
 
 Again seen is a left-sided chest tube.  Minimal lucency along the left heart
 border could reflect a tiny pneumothorax.  No left apical pneumothorax or
 other evidence of pneumothorax is detected. ? slight pleural fluid or
 thickening at the left lung apex, new compared with the prior study. Suspect
 slight leftward shift of the mediastinum, unchanged.  Again seen is increased
 retrocardiac density with air bronchograms, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, similar to prior.  No gross left effusion.  The
 right lung is grossly clear, without focal infiltrate or effusion.  Minimal
 atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region again noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Minimal lucency along the left heart border could represent a very subtle
 pneumothorax. Otherwise, no pneumothorax is detected,after clamping of left
 chest tube. Minimal pleural fluid or thickening at the left lung apex is new.
 
 2.  Continued evidence for a left-sided volume loss and left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.
