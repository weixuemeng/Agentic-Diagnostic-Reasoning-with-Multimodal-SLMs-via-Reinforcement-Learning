                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-op day 2 L2 corpectomy, now pneumothorax, PE, chest tube. 
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 18:03 p.m.
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, no significant interval
 change is detected.  
 
 A left-sided chest tube is present.  No supine film evidence of pneumothorax
 is detected.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with stable prominence of the
 superior mediastinum.    Increased retrocardiac density is consistent with
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Minimal blunting of left
 costophrenic angle is noted and could reflect a small left effusion.  Allowing
 for supine technique, no CHF.  The right lung shows no consolidation or
 effusion.  
 
 At the periphery of these films, note is made of surgical instrumentation in
 the L2 vertebral body space and residual oral contrast in the splenic flexure
 of the colon.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.
