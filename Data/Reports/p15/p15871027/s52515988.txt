                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with stab wounds to chest, status post
 exploratory thoracotomy, chest examination at 13:00 on ___ requested. 
 Evaluate for pneumothorax and hemothorax.  Status post chest tube on water
 seal.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding supine
 chest examination obtained five hours earlier.  The patient is now status post
 sternotomy with typical circular metallic wires in midline.  The patient
 remains extubated similar as on the preceding study.  The right internal
 jugular sheath in unchanged position, but again noted kinking in the outside
 portion of the sheath.  Right-sided mediastinal drainage tube advanced from
 below remains in place, terminating in paramediastinal position at the level
 just 1 cm below the clavicle.  The position is unchanged in comparison with
 the previous study, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax or any new
 pleural effusions that can be identified in this portable single view chest
 examination.  An additional right-sided chest tube advanced from the lower
 lateral chest wall is seen to terminate overlying the right-sided
 cardiomediastinal junction.  The right lateral pleural sinus is free from any
 fluid accumulation.  Heart shadow moderately enlarged as before, but no
 significant interval change.  There exists a small drainage tube seen to
 terminate in the central portion of the heart shadow and possibly representing
 a pericardial drainage.  This line existed already on the previous examination
 five hours ago.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no development of pneumothorax. 
 Significant increase of heart shadow.
