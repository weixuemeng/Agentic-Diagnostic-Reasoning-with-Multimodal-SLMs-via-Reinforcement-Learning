 HISTORY:  Bilateral leg swelling.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild to moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is relatively unchanged
 compared to the prior study.  The aorta remains unfolded.  Lung volumes are
 low with crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Additionally, there is
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures is noted.  Mild loss of height of at least 2 low thoracic vertebral
 bodies appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.
