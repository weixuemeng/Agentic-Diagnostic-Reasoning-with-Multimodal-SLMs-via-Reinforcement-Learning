                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures, which may be due to low lung volumes. 
 Additionally assessment of the lung bases is somewhat limited due to low lung
 volumes, with probable atelectatic changes noted.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Mild loss of height of a vertebral body at the
 thoracolumbar junction at appears chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable mild bibasilar atelectasis.
