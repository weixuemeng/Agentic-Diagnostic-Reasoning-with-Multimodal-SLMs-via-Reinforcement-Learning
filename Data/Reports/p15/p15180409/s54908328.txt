                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single semi-erect AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Seizure, altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 There are low lung volumes.  Cardiac silhouette remains top normal to mildly
 enlarged.  There is a subtle right upper lobe opacity projecting where the
 medial upper right scapula and the posterior right fourth rib overlap. 
 Recommend AP lordotic views or oblique views to assess for underlying
 pulmonary nodule.  No additional evidence of consolidation is seen.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe opacity where the medial upper right scapula and
 the posterior right fourth rib overlap, could be artifactual, however, not
 well seen on the prior study.  Recommend further evaluation with AP lordotic
 views and/or oblique views to assess for underlying pulmonary nodule.  If
 finding persists on the followup radiographs, chest CT would be indicated.
