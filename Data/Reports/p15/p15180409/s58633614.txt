 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Increased seizure activity.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is probably at the upper limits of normal size,
 considering the technique used.  The lung volumes are low.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is perihilar fullness with a mild
 interstitial abnormality suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones are probably demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with mild vascular congestion.
