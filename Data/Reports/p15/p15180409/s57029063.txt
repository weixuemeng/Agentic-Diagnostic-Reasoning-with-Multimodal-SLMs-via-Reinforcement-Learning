                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with epilepsy from chronic
 right hemispheric lesion with unexpected breakthrough seizures.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 several prior studies dating back to ___.
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged unchanged.  Mediastinum is stable.  Lungs are
 essentially clear.  The opacity suspected on the prior radiograph in the right
 upper lung is not clearly seen on the current study, thus most likely
 reflecting summation of shadows.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
