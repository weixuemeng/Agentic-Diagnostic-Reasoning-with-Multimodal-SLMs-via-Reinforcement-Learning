                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Seizures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Tortuous mild heavily calcified thoracic
 aorta.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are without focal airspace
 consolidation.  Several 3-4 mm nodular opacities in the periphery of the right
 lower lung are seen.  Comparison to remote studies would be helpful to assess
 for stability.  .  Pleural surfaces are unremarkable without effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia or aspiration.  Prominent
 atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta.  Several 3-4 mm nodular
 opacities in the periphery of the right lower lung for which comparison to
 remote studies would be recommended.  If remote studies are not available,
 further imaging evaluation with CT may be indicated.
