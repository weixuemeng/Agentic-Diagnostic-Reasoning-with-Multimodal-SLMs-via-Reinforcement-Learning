                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including mild cardiomegaly.  There is a patchy left mid lung opacity,
 although elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  Lung volumes are again low. 
 There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative
 changes involve the each acromioclavicular joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague left mid lung opacity.  Pneumonia is not excluded but
 evaluation of the chest with these films is limited.  Short-term followup
 radiographs may be helpful to reassess.  In addition to the possibility of
 infection, patchy atelectasis could be considered and resolving vascular
 congestion.
