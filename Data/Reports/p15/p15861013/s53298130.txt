                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Low-grade fever after amputation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Hazy opacification of the right hemithorax relative to the left is probably a
 positional artifact, since there are no findings to suggest the alternative
 explanation, posteriorly collected right pleural effusion.  Lungs are grossly
 clear.  The heart is mildly enlarged.
