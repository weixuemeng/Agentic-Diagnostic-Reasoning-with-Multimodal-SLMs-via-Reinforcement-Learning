                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post intubation, evaluate for tube
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP supine chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior same-day chest radiograph ___ at 03:51.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.3 cm above the carina, in 
 appropriate location.  The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable. The
 bilateral hila are obscured.  Diffuse opacification of the bilateral lungs is
 consistent with bilateral layering pleural effusions, better assessed on prior
 same-day CT chest.  Diffuse interstitial prominence with a central prominence
 is compatible with at least mild pulmonary edema.  No focal lung consolidation
 is appreciated.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminating 4.3 cm above the carina.
 2. Bilateral layering pleural effusions.
 3. Mild pulmonary edema.
