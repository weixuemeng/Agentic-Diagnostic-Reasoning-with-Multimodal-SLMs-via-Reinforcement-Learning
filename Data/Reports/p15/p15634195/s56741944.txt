                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with shortness of breath  // r/o mass
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are stable from prior exam. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Displaced fracture of the right sixth rib shows callus formation.
 There is a likely cortical interruption of the left ribs 7 and 8 at the
 lateral aspect.  Mild left pleural effusion. No focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Severe degenerative changes in the right shoulder.
 Borderline dilated large bowel at 6.2 cm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No suspicious lung masses.
 2. Left seventh and eighth ribs are likely fractured at the lateral aspect. If
 further evaluation is needed, a dedicated rib series would be the appropriate
 examination.
 3. Mild left pleural effusion might indeed be a sequela of the left rib
 fractures.
 4. Previously seen right sixth rib fracture shows evidence of healing.
