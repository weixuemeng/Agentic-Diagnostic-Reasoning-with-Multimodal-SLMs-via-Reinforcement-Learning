 pleural effusions are noted, left greater than right.  Associated with the
 left pleural effusion is likely compressive lower lobe atelectasis, though
 difficult to exclude a pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  The aorta
 is calcified and unfolded.  Bony structures are unchanged with a chronic right
 seventh rib deformity.
