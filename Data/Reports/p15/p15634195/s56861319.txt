                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chf, aspiration  // r/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are slightly increased compared to prior.  Increased
 interstitial opacities represent new mild pulmonary edema.  A right lower lung
 opacification may represent pulmonary edema and a pneumonia is less likely
 considering similar appearance on prior exams.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 stable.  The mediastinal contours are stable.  Stable calcifications of the
 aortic arch.  Interval decrease in moderate left pleural effusion and small
 right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New mild pulmonary edema.  Slight interval decrease of bilateral pleural
 effusions.
