                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Right lower quadrant pain and guaiac-positive stool.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior chest radiographs are available from ___.  A
 more recent chest CT is also available from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 There is mild-to-moderate unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The arch is partly
 calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There are
 streaky left basilar opacities suggesting minor atelectasis.  A small
 eventration is noted along the anterior right hemidiaphragm.  There is an
 air-fluid level in the stomach.  Air-fluid levels are seen in the epigastric
 region.  There is no evidence for free air.  Cholecystectomy clips project
 over the right upper quadrant.  Moderate degenerative changes are similar
 along the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Streaky left basilar opacities
 suggestive of minor atelectasis.  Air-fluid levels in the epigastrium; no
 evidence of free air.
