                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Hypotension, tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is within normal limits.  The aorta remains unfolded. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  A small to moderate size partially
 loculated right pleural effusion appears increased in size compared to the
 prior exam.  Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis, but
 infection is not excluded.  Small left pleural effusion may be present, though
 assessment of the left costophrenic angle is obscured due to overlying wires. 
 No pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval increase in size of small to moderate size right pleural effusion, a
 component of which is loculated laterally.  Possible small left pleural
 effusion, though the left costophrenic angle is not well assessed.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
