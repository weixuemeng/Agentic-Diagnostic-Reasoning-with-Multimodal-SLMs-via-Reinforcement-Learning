                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cirrhosis with confusion, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided.  As seen
 previously, there are bilateral pleural effusions slightly increased on the
 left and stable on the right.  The subjacent opacities in the lower lungs
 could represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.  The upper lungs are well
 aerated.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are
 intact. TIPS partially imaged in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, subjacent consolidations, may
 represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.
