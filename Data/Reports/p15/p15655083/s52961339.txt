                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a right central venous line; evaluate line
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, portable dated ___, earlier on the
 same day at 12:56.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT is in standard position.  Enteric tube tip and side port projected
 with expected region of the stomach in the left upper quadrant.  The newly
 placed right IJ catheter tip projects over the expected region of the SVC -RA
 junction.
 
 Overall, no significant interval change in the radiographic appearance of the
 heart and lungs.  Persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle most
 likely reflects a small pleural effusion.  There is probably mild edema.  The
 heart is top-normal in size.  The descending thoracic aorta is slightly
 tortuous.  Aortic knob calcifications are minute old.  No pneumothorax, focal
 consolidation, or significant right pleural effusion.  Bibasilar streaky
 opacities are likely atelectasis. Mild dextroconvex curvature of the thoracic
 spine is unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Newly placed right IJ tip projects over the expected region of the SVC-RA
 junction.
 
 2.  Otherwise, no overall significant interval change in the radiographic
 appearance of the heart and lungs with probable mild edema, top-normal heart
 size, and a persistent small left pleural effusion.
