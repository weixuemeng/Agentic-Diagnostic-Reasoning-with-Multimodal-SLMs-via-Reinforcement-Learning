                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and clubbing, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac
 silhouette has minimally increased.  There are no pleural effusions.  No hilar
 or mediastinal adenopathy.  The appearance of the lung parenchyma is
 unremarkable.  There is no evidence of fibrotic changes and no evidence of
 infection.  A triangular density projecting over the medial part of the left
 scapula, with a diameter of approximately 5 mm, likely represents a bone
 island (this structure is not visible on the lateral radiograph).
 
 Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
