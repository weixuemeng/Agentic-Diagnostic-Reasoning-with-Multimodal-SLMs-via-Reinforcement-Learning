                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post liver tx with multiple pulmonary
 nodules seen on chest x-ray and CT.  Assess for size stability.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Calcified
 granulomas are again noted in the right lung consistent with prior
 granulomatous disease.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Previously
 identified nodule in the left lower lobe is not appreciated on today's
 examination. Pulmonary nodules identified on prior chest CT from ___
 are difficult to visualize on plain films.  However, these do not appear
 appreciably enlarged.  For a complete and more thorough evaluation, follow up
 with chest CT examination is recommended.
