                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p L hip hemi arthroplasty  // r/u PNA, acute
 process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, there is new subsegmental atelectasis at the
 right lung base, with possible small bilateral effusions.  Minimal linear
 atelectasis left base is also new.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF, similar to the prior
 film.  No frank consolidation is identified.  No free air seen beneath the
 diaphragms.  Old healed left clavicular fracture again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New right greater the left base atelectasis, probably with new small bowel
 pleural effusions.  If there is specific clinical concern for a pneumonic
 infiltrate, then a lateral view may help for further assessment.
 2. Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF, similar to the prior film.
