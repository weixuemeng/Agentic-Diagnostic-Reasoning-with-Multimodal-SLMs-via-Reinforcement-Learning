                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  The lungs appear clear.  Posterior basilar
 opacity not apparent on the frontal view appears very similar to the prior
 examinations, so there is no evidence for an acute process.  A remodeled left
 clavicle fracture appears old.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
