                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and aspiration, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated.  Nasogastric tube has been removed, and right internal jugular vein
 catheter is also removed.  There is a bilateral peripheral symmetrical
 increase in interstitial structures, suggesting a fibrotic process.  This
 process is unchanged since the previous image.  The lung volumes are rather
 low.  Moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pleural
 effusions.  No acute changes in the lung parenchyma.
