  Minimal retrocardiac opacification is likely atelectasis in the setting of low
  lung volumes.  Consider conventional PA/lateral views for further
  characterization.  No pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
  Stable appearance of intersitial lung disease.  Moderate cardiomegaly, which
  appears slightly increased from the prior exam, although may be due to lower
  lung volumes accentuating the heart size.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  COPD, on home oxygen with elevated white blood cell
 count and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Minimal
 retrocardiac opacity is most likely due to atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volume.  Underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not
 excluded.  Consider dedicated PA and lateral views if patient able for further
 evaluation.  Increased interstitial markings consistent with patient's known
 interstitial lung disease are grossly stable.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 Cardiac silhouette appears slightly more prominent compared to the prior
 study, although this can be due to differences in inspiration and position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle patchy left base retrocardiac opacity could be due to
 atelectasis; however, consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  If patient able, consider PA and lateral views for further
 evaluation.
