                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ ___ and ___ as well as prior
 chest CT ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable enlarged cardiac silhouette, which corresponds to both
 cardiomegaly and small pericardial effusion on recent chest CT.  Bilateral
 chronic interstitial lung disease appears similar to recent studies, with
 distribution favoring UIP.  No superimposed acute areas of consolidation or
 atelectasis are evident, and there is no evidence of either pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax. Proximal right humeral fracture is incompletely evaluated on
 this CXR.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Chronic interstitial lung disease with distribution favoring UIP.  No
 superimposed acute process to explain the patient's symptoms.  If pulmonary
 embolism is suspected clinically, a dedicated CT angiography study would be
 suggested.
 
 2.  Incompletely imaged proximal right humeral fracture, which has been more
 fully evaluated by a dedicated right shoulder radiograph ___ ___.
