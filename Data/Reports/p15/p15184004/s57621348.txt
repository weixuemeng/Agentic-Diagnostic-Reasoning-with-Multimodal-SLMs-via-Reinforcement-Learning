                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia,?  Pneumonia 
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiograph from earlier today and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate well expanded
 lungs. Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal contours are
 otherwise unremarkable. Diffusely increased reticular interstitial markings
 are consistent with known interstitial lung disease (ILD). No consolidations,
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax is appreciated. Right humeral head fracture
 with increased subacromial space is better assessed on dedicated radiograph of
 the right shoulder from the outside hospital. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Emphysema/ILD without superimposed pneumonia.
 2. Known right humeral head fracture.
