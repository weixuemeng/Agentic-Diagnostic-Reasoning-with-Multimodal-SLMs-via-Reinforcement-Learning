                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, diarrhea and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large hiatal hernia with an air-fluid level, as seen
 previously.  The chest is hyperinflated.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable including calcification along the aortic arch.  There
 is a suspected unchanged calcified right hilar lymph node.  Pulmonary edema
 has cleared.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  A very small
 hyperdense focus projecting over the right upper lung is consistent with an
 unchanged granuloma.  The bones appear demineralized.  A mild-to-moderate
 lower thoracic compression deformity appears unchanged.  Suspected upper
 lumbar compression fractures appear mild, but were not imaged previously.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Hyperinflation. 
 Large hiatal hernia.
