 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There are diffuse bilateral
 interstitial opacities, more predominant in the lung bases, with ___ B
 lines and associated small bilateral pleural effusions.  Cardiac size is
 slightly enlarged allowing for limitations of this AP view.  Significant
 atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch are present.  There is no
 pneumothorax. Evidence of a large hiatal hernia is again seen. Left axillary
 soft tissue calcifications are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Acute pulmonary edema with associated bilateral pleural
 effusions.
