                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears stable.  The lungs are clear aside from a small nodular
 hyperdense focus in the right mid lung which likely represents a calcified
 granuloma and is stable from prior.  No effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Bony structures appear intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
