                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PMHx of treated syphilis who is transferred
 from___ for management of post-viral CAP c/b loculated pleural
 effusions. Now s/p chest tube placement, which is no longer draining.  //
 interval change in pleural effusion? positioning of catheter?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 04:40.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a right pigtail catheter overlying the right lung base. There is
 a large right effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Allowing
 for differences in positioning, this is essentially unchanged compared with 1
 day earlier. No pneumothorax is detected, though faint lucency overlying the
 right lung base could reflect the locules of air identified on the interval CT
 scan.
 
 Again seen is atelectasis at the left lung base. There is upper zone
 redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged seen and the remains midline.
 
 Mild right convex curvature in the upper thoracic spine is likely present.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation and
 right pigtail type catheter. Findings are essentially unchanged compared with
 1 day earlier.
