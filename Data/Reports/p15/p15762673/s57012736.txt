                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall and subdural hemorrhage with left chest wall pain
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest radiograph from needle from earlier
 today.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are somewhat low in
 volume but clear with perhaps trace bilateral pleural effusions or pleural
 thickening given blunting of the posterior costophrenic sulci.  The heart and
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable aside from mild unfolding of the aorta. 
 Irregularity of the lateral ___ and ___ left ribs could reflect fracture or
 artifact due to overlapping structures.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Possible nondisplaced fractures of the lateral/anterolateral left
 ___ and 7th ribs without pneumothorax or significant pleural effusion. 
 Consider rib series if clinically relevant.
