                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chest pain/dyspnea. Recent major crush
 injury with C7/T1 fracture  // eval for PNA/effusion/rib fx
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, lung volumes are slightly low,
 accentuating the cardiac silhouette and resulting in crowding of
 bronchovascular structures at the lung bases.  There are no areas of
 consolidation within the lungs to suggest the presence of pneumonia.  No
 pneumothorax or acute, displaced rib fracture is identified on this portable
 chest exam.
