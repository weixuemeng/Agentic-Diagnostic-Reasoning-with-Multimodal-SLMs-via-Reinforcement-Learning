 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is top-normal but stable. Prominence of the main pulmonary artery
 as well as potentially present bilateral enlargement of the pulmonary arteries
 is demonstrated concerning for pulmonary hypertension. Also there are
 bilateral interstitial changes, minimal but new since the prior study. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No focal consolidations are present.
 Giving the provided findings, further assessment with chest CT would be
 recommended.
