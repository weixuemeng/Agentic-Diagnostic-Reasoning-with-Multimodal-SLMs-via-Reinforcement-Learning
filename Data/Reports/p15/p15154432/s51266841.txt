 Endotracheal tube, left internal jugular central line, and nasogastric tube
 are unchanged in position.  There is improving aeration in both lungs
 consistent with resolving but residual pulmonary edema.  There is persistent
 retrocardiac consolidation with associated layering effusion consistent with
 partial left lower lobe atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen, although the
 sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi erect positioning.
 Stable cardiac enlargement.
