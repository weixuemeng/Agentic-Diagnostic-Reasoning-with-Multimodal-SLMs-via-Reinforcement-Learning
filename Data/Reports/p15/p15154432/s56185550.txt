                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever  // effusion, consolidation change,
 edema      effusion, consolidation change, edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged.  Continued low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter
 of the heart.  Opacification at the left base is again seen.  This could
 represent merely volume loss in the left lower lobe and small pleural
 effusion.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered, especially in the left
 perihilar region.
