                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  Although perhaps exaggerated by AP portable technique, the heart is
 relatively prominent in size for age with a globular appearance.  The lungs
 appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mildly prominent heart size for age although potentially
 exaggerated by technique; follow-up standard PA and lateral radiographs may be
 useful to reassess when feasible.  No evidence of acute disease.
