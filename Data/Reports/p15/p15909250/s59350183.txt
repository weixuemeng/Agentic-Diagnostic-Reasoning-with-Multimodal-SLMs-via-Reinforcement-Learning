                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman intubated with OGT  // Please evaluate
 placement of OGT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A newly placed OG tube terminates in the stomach. An endotracheal tube
 terminates in the mid to lower trachea.  A right pigtail catheter remains in
 place.  A geographic right lung perihilar airspace opacity is unchanged. A
 left basilar retrocardiac airspace opacity has slightly improved. There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is stable moderate S-shape scoliosis of the thoracic
 lumbar spine.  Small sternotomy wires are intact and aligned.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change in the right perihilar consolidation, which may
 be due to a combination of pulmonary contusion and right upper lobe
 atelectasis. A left basilar retrocardiac opacity has slightly improved,
 possibly due to resolving contusion, aspiration, or atelectasis.
