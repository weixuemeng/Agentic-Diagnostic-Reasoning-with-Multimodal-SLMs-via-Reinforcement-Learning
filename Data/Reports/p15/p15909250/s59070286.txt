 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 06:11
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi supine chest film ___ at 12:08 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a right basilar pigtail catheter with improved aeration
 in the right hemithorax consistent with resolving pleural effusion. There is
 persistent airspace opacity in the right lung likely reflecting persistent
 atelectasis, although pulmonary contusion or superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded.  Patchy peripheral left upper lobe opacity and left retrocardiac
 opacity also likely reflect areas of pulmonary contusion, aspiration or
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax. Overall left-sided cardiac and mediastinal
 contours appear stable. Stable thoracic scoliosis. No acute bony abnormality
 appreciated.
