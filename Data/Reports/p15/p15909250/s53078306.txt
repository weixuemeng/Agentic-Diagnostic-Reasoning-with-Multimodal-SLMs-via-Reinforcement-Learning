  Now near complete opacification the right hemi thorax, possibly with a large

  visualization of pulmonary contusions which often take many hours to
  visualize, but the more concerning feature would be a hemothorax especially
  given the patient's clinical hematocrit dropped.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lung contusions s/p motrocycle accident
 pls eval any inteval hange or atelec vs hemothorax vs effusion  // ___ year old
 woman with lung contusions s/p motrocycle accident pls eval any inteval hange
 or atelec vs hemothorax vs effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ CT and radiograph
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In the interval since the prior study, there is now near-complete
 opacification of the right hemi thorax possibly due to a combination of
 pleural fluid and lung opacification.  While part of the parenchymal
 abnormalities may be contusions, which can often develop hours post initial
 insult, the more worrisome possibilities include hemothorax especially given
 the patient's hematocrit has decreased. A chest CT could be reasonable at this
 juncture for further evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by ___ with Dr ___ on
 the phone on ___ at 07:22
