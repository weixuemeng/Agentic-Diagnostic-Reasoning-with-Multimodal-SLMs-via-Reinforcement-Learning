                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 15:12
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia, H/O metastatic prostate
 cancerassess for interval change.
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest ___ at 15:12 are submitted
 compared to the prior study of ___ and ___. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The patient's mandible obscures the apices.  There continues to be bilateral
 diffuse interstitial abnormality which more likely is a chronic finding given
 the interval improvement in the appearance of the chest suggesting resolved
 pulmonary and interstitial edema.  However, an acute atypical pneumonia cannot
 be entirely excluded.  Comparison to more remote chest images would be helpful
 to assess for the chronicity of the interstitial process.  There is no focal
 airspace consolidation on the current examination to suggest bacterial
 pneumonia.  Previously described opacity in the right upper lung has resolved.
 No pleural effusions.  Lungs are hyperinflated consistent with underlying
 emphysema.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions.
