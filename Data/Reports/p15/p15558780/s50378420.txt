                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 9:19
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypoxia, assess for interval change.
 
 Compared to ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 9:19 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No significant interval change in the bilateral parenchymal reticular and
 nodular opacities.  No new airspace consolidation is seen to suggest
 pneumonia.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given
 differences in patient rotation.  No pneumothorax.  The bones overall appear
 increased in density which would be consistent with metastatic disease in this
 patient with known prostate carcinoma.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax.
