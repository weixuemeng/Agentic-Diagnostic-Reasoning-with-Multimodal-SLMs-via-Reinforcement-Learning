                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  A rounded mediastinal mass is present in the region of the
 thoracoabdominal junction measuring about 6.6 cm in diameter and apparently
 containing peripheral calcifications on the lateral view.  It is difficult to
 separate from the descending thoracic aortic interface on the PA view,
 suggestive of a calcified aortic aneurysm.  A mass arising in the lower
 esophagus is less likely.  Heart size and pulmonary vascularity are normal. 
 Lungs are clear except for linear atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  6.6 cm diameter lower mediastinal mass with apparent peripheral
 rim of calcification. This is incompletely characterized but is concerning for
 a localized aneurysm of the thoracoabdominal aorta.  A mass arising from the
 lower esophagus is less likely.  CT is recommended for further evaluation as
 communicated to Dr. ___ on ___ at 7:45 a.m. at the time of
 discovery.
