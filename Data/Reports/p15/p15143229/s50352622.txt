                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Assess NG tube repositioning.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest with the patient in a
 semi-erect position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___ at 9:35
 a.m..
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval adjustment of the patient's NG tube, which is now seen
 terminating in a post pyloric location.  As compared to prior examination from
 2 hr earlier, the remainder of the exam is essentially unchanged.  The right
 upper lobe opacification is stable, consistent with post radiation changes and
 atelectasis.  There is no evidence of new focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.
