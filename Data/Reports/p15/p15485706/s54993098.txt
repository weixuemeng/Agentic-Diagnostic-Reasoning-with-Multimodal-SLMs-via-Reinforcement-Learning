                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is clear decrease in
 extent in severity of the pre-existing right lung pneumonia.  However, right
 lung opacities are still seen in the upper and middle lobe, and should be
 radiographically followed in eight to ten weeks so that complete resolution
 can be documented.
 
 No other changes.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No evidence of
 reactive lymphadenopathy.  No pleural effusions.
