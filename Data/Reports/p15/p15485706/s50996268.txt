                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and fever.  Tachycardia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  When compared to prior, there has been continued
 interval resolution of parenchymal opacities in the right lung which still
 vaguely persist.  There is, however, more conspicuous left perihilar opacity
 projecting on the frontal view.  There is no effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight residual right-sided parenchymal nodular opacities
 compatible with resolving infection.  Left perihilar opacity, better seen on
 the frontal view, which could represent developing infiltrate versus
 atelectasis.  Clinical correlation recommended.
