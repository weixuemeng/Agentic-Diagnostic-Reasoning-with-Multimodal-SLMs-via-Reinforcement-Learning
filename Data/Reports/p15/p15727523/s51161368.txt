                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Lupus nephritis status post kidney transplant, on
 immunosuppression, with fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are low which limits
 evaluation.  There is no large opacity, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable accounting
 for differences in technique.  There is no free air beneath the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No overt signs signs of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
