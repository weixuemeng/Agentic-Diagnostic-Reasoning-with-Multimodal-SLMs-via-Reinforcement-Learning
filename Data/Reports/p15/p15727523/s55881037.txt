 As compared to the most recent examination, there has been no significant
 interval change.  The lung volumes are again noted to be low, resulting in
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2.  Chronic moderate cardiomegaly.
