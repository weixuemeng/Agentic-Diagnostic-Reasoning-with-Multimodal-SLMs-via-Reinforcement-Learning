 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Mild prominence of central
 pulmonary vasculature persists, suggesting central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the bilateral
 posterior costophrenic angles, new since the prior study, consistent with
 trace pleural effusions.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Trace bilateral pleural effusions, new since prior.  Central pulmonary
 vascular engorgement without pulmonary edema.
