                                 FINAL REPORT
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine radiograph of chest was reviewed in
 comparison with prior chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral mid and lower lung pulmonary opacities which progressed between ___ and ___ have remained unchanged since then.  Since prior
 imaging history shows a very slow progression of these pulmonary opacities
 between ___ and ___ in this patient with known bronchioloalveolar
 carcinoma, short interval progression as mentioned above is more likely due to
 aspiration/infection or hemorrhage.  Interval worsening from lung malignancy
 is less likely.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
