                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea, low O2 saturation, question worsening lung cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is interval
 increase in ground-glass opacities involving the bilateral lower lungs which
 is concerning for interval progression of bronchoalveolar carcinoma though the
 possibility of a superimposed pneumonia is impossible to exclude.  No large
 effusions or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony
 structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening mid to lower lung ground-glass opacities which may
 reflect worsening bronchoalveolar carcinoma versus superimposed pneumonia. 
 Recommend followup post-treatment films.
