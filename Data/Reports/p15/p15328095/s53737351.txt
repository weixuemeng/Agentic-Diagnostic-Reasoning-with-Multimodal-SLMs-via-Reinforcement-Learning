                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of cancer now with multiple falls and confusion.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  
 
 Technique:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A dual lead left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged in position with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.  The inspiratory lung
 volumes are appropriate.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Reticulonodular opacities and prominent interstitial markings most pronounced
 in the right lung base may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema although
 superimposed infection is not excluded.  Decreased trace pleural effusions are
 noted. No pneumothorax seen.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable with mild tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  Several clips are noted within the upper abdomen. Marked
 degenerative changes of the right shoulder are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Patchy opacity in the right lung base may represent asymmetric pulmonary
 edema although superimposed infection is not excluded.  
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and decreased bilateral trace pleural
 effusion. 
 
 3.  Stable cardiomegaly.
