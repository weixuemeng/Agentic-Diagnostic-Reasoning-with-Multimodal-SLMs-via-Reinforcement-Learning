                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pedal edema.  Evaluate for fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest upright AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest ___; chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  Low lung volumes.  There is crowding of the pulmonary
 vasculature, likely secondary to low lung volumes.  Lungs are clear except for
 linear bibasilar atelectasis or scarring.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  There are degenerative
 changes of the visualized spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature secondary to low lung volumes. 
 No frank edema.
