 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Extremely low lung volumes are noted with secondary crowding of the
 bronchovascular markings.  There is no definite focal consolidation or
 effusion.  Calcific density projects over the posterior right fourth rib which
 could be a calcified granuloma or bone island.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.  Calcific
 density in the right upper quadrant suggest cholelithiasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process noting low lung volumes.
