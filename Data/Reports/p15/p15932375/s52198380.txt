                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia and dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single upright portable view of the chest demonstrates hazy
 alveolar opacities in the right perihilar region and right lung base.  The
 heart is moderately enlarged, and calcifications are noted in the aortic arch.
 Otherwise, the mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The left lung is grossly clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right sided parencymal opacities compatible with infection vs
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Repeat after treatment suggested to ensure
 resolution.  Cardiomegaly.
