                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CAD, Afib, and valvular heart disease p/w
 SOB. // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest is limited secondary to
 overlying cardiac monitoring device.  Lung volumes are low, resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding. Persistent hazy alveolar opacities in the right
 perihilar region and right lung base, with interval peripheral clearing are
 consistent with infection.  The left lung is relatively clear. The heart and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided parenchymal opacities compatible with infection.
