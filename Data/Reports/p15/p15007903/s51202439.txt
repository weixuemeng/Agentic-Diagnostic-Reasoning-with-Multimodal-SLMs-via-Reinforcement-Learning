                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man p/w pneumoperitoneum, lung nodules on outside
 imaging, ? pneumoperitoneum, now with 2L to 8 L NC O2 requirement, r/o pulm
 edema vs other acute process  // r/o pulm edema vs other acute process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___ chest radiograph, pneumoperitoneum appears less
 pronounced, but the patient is not fully upright on the current study, a
 factor that may contribute to this apparent change.  Right mediastinal and
 right hilar contours are markedly widened, consistent with lymphadenopathy. 
 Heterogeneous opacities in the right lung are again demonstrated including a
 dominant poorly defined right upper lobe nodule which has been more fully
 characterize by CT of 1 day earlier.  .
