 pulmonary opacity in the left lower lobe is now more apparent.  No new
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The cardiac contours are unchanged.  An
 enteric catheter side hole is seen projecting over the stomach.

 hemidiaphragm and may represent lower lobe atelectasis and/or pneumonia. 
 Increasing pulmonary opacities at the left base and the right base could
 represent developing consolidation.
