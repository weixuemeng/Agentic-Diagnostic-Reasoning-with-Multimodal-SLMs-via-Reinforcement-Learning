                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxia, left lower pneumonia,  //
 Radiology CT requesting CXR to correlate with CT scan from today.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:
 CT performed 6 hours earlier and chest x-ray ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to study performed a day earlier bilateral opacities have improved. 
 On concurrent CT these correspond to predominantly peripheral ground-glass and
 peribronchial nodular opacities in the right upper, right middle  and right
 lower lobes.  Left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms mainly
 representing collapse.  There are bilateral pleural effusions.  Opacities in
 the left upper lobe are similar to the right upper lobe but in less amount. 
 Cardiomegaly,  coronary calcifications, hiatal hernia and calcification of the
 mitral annulus are better seen in concurrent CT
 Left PICC tip is in the cavoatrial junction
