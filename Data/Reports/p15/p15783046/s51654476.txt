                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with intoxication, providing intubation, assess
 ETT placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable chest radiograph was obtained.  Endotracheal tube
 is in satisfactory position in the mid trachea.  Nasogastric tube courses into
 the stomach and out of view.  Lungs are low in volumes with resultant
 bronchovascular crowding; however, more increased opacification in the left
 base could reflect aspiration.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactory position of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.
 2.  Possible aspiration in the left lower lobe
