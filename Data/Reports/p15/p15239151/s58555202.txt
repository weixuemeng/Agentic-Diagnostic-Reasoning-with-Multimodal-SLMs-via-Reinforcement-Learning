                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and hypotension and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There is probably a trace pleural effusion on the left.  A
 patchy opacity projecting over the right upper lobe suggests pneumonia. 
 Likewise, pneumonia may involve the left lower lung, but less striking.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with pneumonia.  Short-term followup
 radiographs are suggested as well as correlation with clinical presentation.
