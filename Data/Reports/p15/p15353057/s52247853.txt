  Low lung volumes without focal consolidation.  Subtle irregularity at the
  lateral left third rib is felt to be due to overlap of structures.  Correlate
  with focal tenderness at this site for possible nondisplaced fracture.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain and cough. Also with right leg pain
 after fall from standing.  // eval for pneumonia, fracture/dislocation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  No definite focal consolidation is
 seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac silhouette size is
 top-normal, likely exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  No pulmonary edema is seen.  Subtle irregularity at the lateral
 left third rib is felt to be due to overlap of structures.  Correlate with
 focal tenderness at this site for possible nondisplaced fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
