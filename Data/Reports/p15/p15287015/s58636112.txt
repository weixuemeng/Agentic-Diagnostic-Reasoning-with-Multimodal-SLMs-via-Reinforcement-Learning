                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with low grade fever - with hypoxia  //
 infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP, upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes have decreased in the interim with associated bronchovascular
 crowding.  Slight interval increase in retrocardiac opacity with air
 bronchograms likely reflects atelectasis and/or vascular crowding in the
 setting of lower lung volumes.  No pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly persists. 
 Trace fluid in the center fissure is noted.  Rounded opacity projecting just
 to the left of midline over the heart may be projectional.  Nonspecific
 gaseous distension of bowel loops in the upper abdomen is noted.  Mild
 dextroconvex scoliosis, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval slight increase in retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis
 and lower lung volumes.
