                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoglycemia  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature.
 However, the vasculature is somewhat indistinct suggesting a component of mild
 interstitial edema. Patchy opacities at both bases may reflect atelectasis,
 although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is essentially stable allowing
 for differences in lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes
 although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Probable superimposed mild interstitial
 edema.
