                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post dual-chamber PPM.  Evaluate lead
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker is in adequate position with
 leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, expected locations.
 The heart remains enlarged and is essentially unchanged since ___. 
 There is a small left pleural effusion which appears increased in size when
 compared to prior examination.  Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no
 pneumothorax. Rightward deviation of the trachea with an adjacent area of
 increased opacity is suggestive of a thyroid mass.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided pacemaker with leads in adequate position. 
 
 2.  Increased small left pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Rightward deviation of the trachea may be suggestive of a thyroid mass.
 Clinical correlation is recommended.
