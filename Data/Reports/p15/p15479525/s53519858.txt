 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Amiodarone toxicity.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lateral radiograph shows minimal flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms, potentially suggesting mild overinflation.  Otherwise, the
 lung parenchyma is unremarkable, in particular there is no evidence for
 pulmonary edema and no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The hilar and
 mediastinal structures are unremarkable.
