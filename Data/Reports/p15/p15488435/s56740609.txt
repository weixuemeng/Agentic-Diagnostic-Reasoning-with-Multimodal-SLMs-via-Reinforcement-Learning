                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of multiple cancers.  Presenting with evidence of fluid
 overload.  Assess for CHF or cardiomegaly.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CTA of the chest from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  A focal opacity in the right lower lung
 zone may represent atelectasis, though pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is
 mild vascular congestion, though no frank pulmonary edema.  A nodule in the
 right upper lung zone appears grossly similar to the prior radiograph, and is
 better characterized on the CT.  There is a moderate-sized right pleural
 effusion and a small left pleural effusion.  Both have increased from the
 prior exam.  There is no pneumothorax.  The aorta is tortuous.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise normal.  Degenerative changes are
 noted in the spine with mild loss of height in multiple vertebral bodies,
 similar to the prior exams.  The known severe compression fracture in L1 is
 not well visualized due to the overlying soft tissues.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate right and small left pleural effusions, both increased in size
 from ___.
 2.  Right lower lobe opacity may be compressive atelectasis from the adjacent
 effusion, though pneumonia is difficult to exclude.
 3.  Vascular congestion, without frank pulmonary edema.
 4.  Unchanged right upper lobe pulmonary nodule, better characterized on the
 prior CT.
