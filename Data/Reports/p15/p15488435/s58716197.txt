                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath upon exertion
 with wheezing, question pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  A dextroscoliosis of the T-spine is noted.
 The heart is stable in size.  There is a nodular opacity in the right
 perihilar region which may represent superimposed bony structures though a
 true pulmonary nodule is difficult to exclude.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No
 overt pulmonary edema.  Bony structures appear intact.  Right AC joint
 arthropathy is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Possible right pulmonary
 nodule for which non-emergent chest CT is recommended to further assess.
