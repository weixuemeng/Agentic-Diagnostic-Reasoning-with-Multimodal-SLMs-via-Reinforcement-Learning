                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Faint interstitial opacities are visualized at the lung bases
 suggestive of a chronic interstitial process. The lungs are however without a
 focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is mildly enlarged but stable.  No acute fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. Possible chronic basilar
 interstitial process, which can be further evaluated by separately dictated CT
 of same date.
