                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:18 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Pyloric channel ulcer, after pyloroplasty.  Hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest viewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Lung volumes are quite low with marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm,
 attributable to distention of both the stomach and the transverse and splenic
 flexure of the colon.  Heart is enlarged but partially obscured by the
 elevated hemidiaphragm and the bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed.  Left upper lung is clear. 
 Right lung base laterally is reticulated suggesting pulmonary fibrosis.
