                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is
 a large right pleural effusion with consolidation involving the right upper
 lobe.  The left lung appears clear.  The right heart border cannot be
 assessed.  The mediastinal contour is also suboptimally assessed given the
 opacification/effacement of the right margin.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity within the right upper lobe with consolidation/effusion
 obscuring the mid-to-lower lung.  Findings may be compatible with pneumonia
 and recommend followup to resolution.
