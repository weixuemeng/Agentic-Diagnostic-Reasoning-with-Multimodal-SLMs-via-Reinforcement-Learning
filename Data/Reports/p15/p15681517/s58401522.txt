                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with IV drug abuse, passed out after injecting
 heroin and woke up with left/right rib pain and headache.  Evaluate for rib
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Heart is normal
 size and cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Lungs are well expanded
 and clear.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fracture is identified. Age-indeterminate
 compression deformities are present in the lower thoracic spine. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
 2.  Age-indeterminate compression deformities in the lower thoracic spine. 
 3.  No displaced rib fractures; however, conventional chest radiography is not
 sensitive for detection of rib fractures.
