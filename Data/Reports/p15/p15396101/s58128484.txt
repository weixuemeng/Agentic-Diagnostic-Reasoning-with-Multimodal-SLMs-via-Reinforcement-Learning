                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever bilateral crackles s/p gastric revision
 two weeks  // CXR eval for pnaCT- eval for anatomosis leak abscess
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is top-normal in size.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Lung volumes are slightly low which accentuates
 bronchovascular markings.  Given that, there are increasing patchy bibasilar
 opacities, left greater than right, which could reflect atelectasis; however,
 infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis, although infection
 should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
