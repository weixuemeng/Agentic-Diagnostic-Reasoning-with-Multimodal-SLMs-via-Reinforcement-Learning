                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with 20-pound weight loss.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 prominence of the right hilum.  Overall, interstitial markings are increased
 with patchy opacity at the right lower lobe with possible subtle air
 bronchograms.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Prominent right hilum which further evaluation with non-emergent chest CT
 is recommended.
 
 2.  Areas of patchy right base opacity, nonspecific, but could be due to
 underlying consolidation from infection or aspiration.
 
 3.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
