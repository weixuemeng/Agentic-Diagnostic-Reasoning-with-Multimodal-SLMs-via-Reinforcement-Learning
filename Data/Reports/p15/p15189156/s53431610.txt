                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Due to start cycle 3 of chemotherapy today for Waldenstroms.  Fevers
 and rigors for 2 days.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of the chest dated ___.  CT of the chest with
 contrast dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.  Again seen is a well rounded opacity
 at the left lung base which corresponds to an area of rounded atelectasis on
 the previous CT scan.  Additionally, there is an area of opacity adjacent to
 this, at the left lung base.  In the lateral view, this opacity appears to
 project near an area of pleural thickening and it may represent a pleural
 fluid collection or acute consolidation.  A port is seen in the right chest
 wall with the catheter terminating in the superior to mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe opacity with pleural thickening which may represent pleural
 fluid collection or acute consolidation.  Recommend oblique views for further
 visualization.
