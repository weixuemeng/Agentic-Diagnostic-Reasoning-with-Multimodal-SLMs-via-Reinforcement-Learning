                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with klebsiella bacteremia and ?rounded
 atelectasis on CXR  // ? pneumonia      ? pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left costal pleural thickening, predominantly posterior and, best seen on the
 lateral view, rounded atelectasis at the base of the left lung are unchanged
 since at least ___, confirmed at the time with a chest CT.
 
 There is no consolidation to suggest active pneumonia, but there is the
 suggestion of a new one cm wide right basal pleural nodule, seen on the
 frontal view projecting over the seventh anterior interspace, probably
 unrelated to bacteremia.  I would suggest a repeat PA and lateral chest
 radiograph in 2 weeks, supplemented by shallow oblique views, to see if there
 really is a new lung nodule which would warrant chest CT scanning.
 
 Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes.
 
 Right subclavian infusion catheter ends in the low SVC.  .
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  PA and lateral chest radiograph in 2 weeks, supplemented
 by shallow oblique views, to see if there really is a new right basal lung
 nodule which would warrant chest CT scanning.
