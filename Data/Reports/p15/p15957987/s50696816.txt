                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with neutropenic fever.  Question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate stable position
 of a left pectoral Port-A-Cath with tip in the lower SVC.  A fusiform area of
 lucency projecting over the right heart border is consistent with a
 pull-through neoesophagus in this patient status post esophagectomy.  The
 heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax, vascular congestion, or
 pleural effusion.  Small region of consolidation overlying the heart on the
 lateral view is new and could be early pneumonia.  Cholecystectomy clips are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible small pneumonia.  
 
 Findings reported to Dr. ___ ___ phone at 9am on ___.
