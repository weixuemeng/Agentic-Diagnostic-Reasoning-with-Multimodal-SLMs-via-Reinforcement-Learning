                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Left pleural effusion, status post catheter placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new left-sided chest tube.  There is a small left apical
 pneumothorax that is increased compared to prior.  There is volume loss in the
 left lower lobe and left pleural effusion.  The right-sided catheter is
 similar compared to prior, with associated right effusion and right lower lobe
 volume loss.  The vasculature on the right is ill-defined and there is a right
 mid lung alveolar infiltrate and areas of volume loss.  An underlying
 infectious infiltrate, particularly on the right, cannot be excluded.
