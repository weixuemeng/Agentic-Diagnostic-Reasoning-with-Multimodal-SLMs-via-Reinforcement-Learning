                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral chest tubes.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the tip of the left chest tube
 projects over the inferior margin of the clavicle.  There is a small residual
 pneumothorax, quite similar to the appearance on the prior study.
 
 On the right, the pigtail catheter tip is essentially unchanged.  The degree
 of opacification at the right base is similar to the previous study and
 consistent with a combination of effusion and volume loss in the right lower
 lobe.  Small left effusion with atelectasis is again seen.
 
 The pulmonary vascularity appears to be essentially within normal limits.
