                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusions, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, pleural drain on the left
 is in unchanged position.  The extent of the minimal effusion on the left is
 constant.  Also constant is the extent of the retrocardiac atelectasis.
 
 On the right, the effusion has minimally decreased in extent, allowing for a
 better right basal ventilation.
 
 Esophageal stent and left CVA line are in constant position.  No pneumothorax.
