 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the pleural effusion is
 unchanged in extent.  However, the right lung has increased in volume and
 decreased in density, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  The left lung
 is unchanged.  Unchanged esophageal stent and pectoral Port-A-Cath.  No newly
 occurred parenchymal opacities.
