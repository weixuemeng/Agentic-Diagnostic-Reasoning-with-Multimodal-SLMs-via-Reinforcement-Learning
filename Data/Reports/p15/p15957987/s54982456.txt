                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male patient with right-sided pneumonia, shock.  Study
 requested for evaluation of infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and chest CTA from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac size is unchanged. The mediastinum is widened and appears unchanged
 from prior. There are large pleural effusions bilaterally with atelectasis at
 the lung bases. There is a consolidation in the left perihilar region which
 has markedly worsened when compared to prior examination and is likely due to
 worsening pneumonia. Opacities in the right upper lobe are grossly unchanged.
 A questionable small pneumothorax is seen in the left apex. Esophageal stent
 and port A catheter are unchanged in position.  Tubular structure projecting
 within the cardiac region is consistent with a pericardial drain. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Large pleural effusions with worsening left perihilar
 consolidation, likely due to worsening pneumonia.  Questionable small
 pneumothorax at the left apex.
 
 These findings were discussed with ___ by Dr. ___ via
 telephone on ___ at 11:45, time of discovery.
