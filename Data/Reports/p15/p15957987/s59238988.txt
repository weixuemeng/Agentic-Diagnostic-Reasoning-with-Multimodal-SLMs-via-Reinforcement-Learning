                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal image of the chest demonstrates right-sided
 moderate-to-large pleural effusion and left-sided moderate pleural effusion,
 which are essentially unchanged from prior imaging.  Again seen are left
 perihilar, right lower lobe, and left lower lobe opacities which are unchanged
 from prior imaging.  The appearance of these opacities on this exam and on
 prior CTs likely represents aspiration.  The opacity at the left lung base
 likely represents atelectasis adjacent to the left pleural effusion.  There is
 no pneumothorax seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged from
 prior imaging, but is incompletely assessed due to bilateral pleural
 effusions.  An esophageal stent is seen consistent with patient's history of
 esophageal cancer.  A left-sided chest tube has been repositioned in the
 interval.  A subclavian line is in place with the tip in the upper SVC.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essentially unchanged chest radiograph with bilateral pleural
 effusions, right greater than left, and opacities in the left perihilar, right
 lower lobe, and left lower lobe regions.
