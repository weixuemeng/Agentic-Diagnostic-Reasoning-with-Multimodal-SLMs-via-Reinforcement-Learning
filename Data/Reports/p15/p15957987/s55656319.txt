 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Esophageal adenocarcinoma, bilateral empyema, accidental pull of
 the right chest tube, evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right chest view was
 accidentally pulled.  On the current image, there is no convincing evidence
 for a right pneumothorax.  The left chest tube as well as the Port-A-Cath and
 the esophageal stent are in unchanged position.  There is unchanged evidence
 of bilateral, right more than left parenchymal opacities at the lung bases. 
 Moderate retrocardiac atelectasis and moderate cardiomegaly.  No newly
 appeared parenchymal opacities.
