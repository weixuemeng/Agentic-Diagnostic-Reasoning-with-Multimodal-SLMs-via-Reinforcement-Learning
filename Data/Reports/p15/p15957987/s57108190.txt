                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Resected esophageal cancer with stent and bilateral chest tubes.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the esophageal stent is again
 seen.  Bilateral pigtail catheters are in place.  There probably is persistent
 small left apical pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacification persists, consistent
 with pleural fluid and underlying compressive atelectasis.  Retrocardiac
 opacification is consistent with substantial decrease in volume of the left
 lower lobe.
