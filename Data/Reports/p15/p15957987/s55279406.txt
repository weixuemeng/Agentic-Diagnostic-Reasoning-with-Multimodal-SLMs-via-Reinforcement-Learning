                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Interval evaluation of bilateral effusions.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An esophageal stent is present, unchanged.  Compared with ___ at 6:13
 a.m., the right effusion has decreased in size.  Right base pigtail catheter
 is again noted.  Hazy opacity in the right mid zone likely represents fluid
 extending along the minor fissure.  There is some residual collapse and/or
 consolidation at the right lung base.  No significant upper zone
 redistribution.  Small left effusion again noted.  Collapse/consolidation at
 the left medial base is similar, perhaps slightly worse.  The left base
 pigtail catheter is again noted.  No pneumothorax is detected on either side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in right-sided effusion and underlying right
 base collapse/consolidation.  Changes at the left base are similar, possibly
 slightly worse.
