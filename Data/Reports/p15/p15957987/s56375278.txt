                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post-intubation, assess endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed 30 minutes
 prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of endotracheal tube terminating 6.5 cm above
 the carina.  Port-A-Cath is now accessed.  There is now more readily apparent
 small left pleural effusion in addition to previously reported partially
 loculated right pleural effusion.  Stable background pulmonary edema with
 multifocal opacifications like representing infection versus asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: ETT terminates 6.5 cm above carina. Small left pleural effusion
 now evident. Otherwise, unchanged.
