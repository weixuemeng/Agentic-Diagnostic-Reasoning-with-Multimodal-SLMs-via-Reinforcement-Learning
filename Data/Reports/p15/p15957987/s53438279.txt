                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MOnitoring PleurX catheter.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Again seen is a small left apical pneumothorax, very slightly smaller than on
 the film obtained on ___ at 18:12 p.m.  The catheter is again noted. 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
