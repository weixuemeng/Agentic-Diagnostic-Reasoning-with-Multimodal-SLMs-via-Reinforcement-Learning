                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with altered mental status.  Assess for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  Moderate left pleural effusion is
 present with associated parenchymal opacities; these are partly nodular.  A
 convex contour along the left lower medial hemithorax suggests a substantial
 hiatal hernia.  A 3 mm round opacity projects over left upper hemithorax,
 unchanged.  There is no right pleural effusion.  The hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unchanged.  Aortic arch calcifications are again noted. 
 Multiple surgical clips project over left hilar silhouette.  Overlying sternal
 wires appear intact.  Heart is mildly enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Mitral valve prosthesis is noted.  There is new destruction of the right
 posterior eighth rib with a possibly soft tissue mass.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent opacity in the left lung
 base, which may represent atelectasis or infection in the appropriate clinical
 setting; since the opacities are partly nodular, nodules in the left lower
 lung should also be considered.
 
 2.  New right eighth rib destruction.
 
 3.  Findings suggesting a moderate hiatal hernia although not entirely
 specific.
 
 Findings are worrisome for malignancy as demonstrated by a CT performed on the
 same day at the time of finalization of this report.
