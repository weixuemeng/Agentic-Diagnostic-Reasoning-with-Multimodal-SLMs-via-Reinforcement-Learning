                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic ovarian CA with recurrent
 pleural effusion s/p right pleuroscopy and tunneled pleural catheter and left
 chest tube placement  // please eval for interval change in pleural effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 15 58
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An apparent new epidural catheter is present.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged allowing for differences in
 positioning.  No CHF.
 
 The opacity previously seen at the right base has essentially resolved.  There
 is new platelike atelectasis in the right infrahilar region.  No right
 effusion.
 
 Again seen is opacity at the left base, with retrocardiac opacity.  Small left
 effusion is new.  A left pigtail catheter remains in place.
 
 No pneumothorax is detected on either side.  On the right, there is a catheter
 or other tubing overlying the right upper quadrant of the abdomen versus right
 lung base.
 
 Trace subcutaneous air is now seen between the right hemidiaphragm, new
 compared with the prior film.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There is trace subdiaphragmatic air on the right, near the new right tunneled
 pleural catheter.  By report, the patient had abdominal surgery 1 day previous
 and this would be compatible with a small amount of expected intraperitoneal
 air following abdominal surgery.   At this time, I do not see an op note on
 OMR for surgery of 1 day previous.
 
 Small left pleural effusion is new or increased compared with ___.  Patchy
 opacity at the left base is slightly different in configuration but overall
 similar.

 discovery at 5:54 pm ___.  Findings discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ at 18:01 on ___ by telephone, who indicated that the patient
 had recently undergone abdominal surgery.
