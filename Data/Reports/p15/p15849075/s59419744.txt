 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right central venous
 catheter has been removed.  The lung volumes remain unchanged.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The lateral radiograph reveals the presence of mild
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No evidence of major atelectasis, no pneumonia. 
 No pulmonary edema.  The alignment of the sternal wires and the clips after
 CABG is constant.
