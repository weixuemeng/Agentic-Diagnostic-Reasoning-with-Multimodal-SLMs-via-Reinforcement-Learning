                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Cervical fixation
 hardware is partially visualized in the lower cervical spine.  Subtle hazy
 opacity is noted in the lower lungs, increased from prior exam, which could
 represent a very early pneumonia in the right clinical setting.  Aside from
 this, the lungs are clear without large effusion, pneumothorax or convincing
 signs of edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures
 are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the lower lungs which could represent pneumonia
 in the correct clinical setting.  Please correlate clinically.
