                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with weakness  // acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs on ___.  Torso CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Nodular
 opacity projecting over the spine on the lateral view is compatible with
 prominent left-sided osteophyte at the costovertebral body junction on prior
 chest CT.  There is very subtly increased density involving the right lower
 lobe, which may reflect areas of subsegmental atelectasis.  There is moderate
 dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly increased density in the right lower lobe may reflect some
 subsegmental atelectasis however could represent a small focus of infection in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
