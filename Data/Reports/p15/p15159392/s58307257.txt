                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain, coarse breath sounds.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the SVC, unchanged.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with the heart size within normal
 limits.  Aortic knob calcifications are again demonstrated.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Linear bibasilar opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis.  Linear scarring within the medial right lung apex is unchanged. 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Vertebra
 plana of the T4 vertebral body and compression deformity of the T11 vertebral
 body are unchanged.  Expansile lesions within several right-sided ribs are
 compatible with the patient's diagnosis of myeloma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.
