                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with severe abdominal pain.  Evaluate for
 evidence of free air or any other acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes.  The right lung is clear.  A dense
 retrocardiac opacity suggests left lower lobe atelectasis. Linear opacities
 across the left lung field represent discoid atelectasis, but no new confluent
 consolidations are noted in the left lung. The heart size is top normal,
 although assessment is limited in this AP radiograph.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Again seen is a Port-A-Cath catheter with the tip ending at the level of the
 lower SVC.  There is no evidence of abdominal free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe atelectasis.  No evidence of abdominal free air.
