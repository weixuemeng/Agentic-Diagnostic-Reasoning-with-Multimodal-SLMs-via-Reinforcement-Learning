                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of cancer with three-day history sharp left chest pain
 and productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  Left-sided
 Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the SVC.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with aortic knob calcifications
 present.  Linear opacity within the left lung base most likely reflects
 atelectasis.  However, more focal consolidative opacity in the retrocardiac
 region is nonspecific and could represent atelectasis or infection.  Small
 left pleural effusion appears new compared to the prior exam.  Right lung base
 also demonstrates mild atelectatic changes.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated. 
 Expansile lesion within the anterior right fifth rib is unchanged.  Previously
 noted subacute fractures of the right inferior ribs are not clearly
 demonstrated on the current exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar atelectasis with more focal consolidative opacity in the
 retrocardiac region, findings which could represent infection or atelectasis.
 2.  New trace left pleural effusion.
