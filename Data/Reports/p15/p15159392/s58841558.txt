                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough in a patient with multiple myeloma.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior studies.  A left Port-A-Cath ends in the mid SVC. Linear opacities in
 the right lung base represent atelectasis; otherwise, the lungs are clear. 
 There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size
 is normal and a clacified tortuous aortic contour is unchanged. Expansion and
 sclerosis of a few right lower ribs is consistent with the diagnosis of
 myeloma.  In the thoracic spine severe vertebral body compression fractures of
 the T4 and T11 vertebral bodies are unchanged since ___, but are
 slightly worse compared to the radiograph of ___.      
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
 
 2.  Severe T4 and T11 vertebral body compression fractures are unchanged since
 ___; however, slightly worse since ___.
