                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma with cough and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath device is noted with the tip terminating in the SVC. 
 Heart size is normal.  Aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.  Linear bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 clearly noted.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Known lytic
 lucencies involving the thoracic osseous structures is better delineated on
 the previous CT including vertebra plana of the T4 vertebral body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar linear atelectasis.  Known osseous lesions are better assessed on
 the recent CT including T4 vertebra plana.
