                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma, splinting from pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Left-sided Port-A-Cath device is noted
 with tip terminating in the mid SVC.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable except for aortic knob
 calcifications.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Linear opacities within
 both lung bases, more pronounced on the left, are compatible with subsegmental
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Expansile
 lesion of the fifth anterior rib on the right may be related to underlying
 myeloma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Linear opacities at both lung bases, likely reflective of subsegmental
 atelectasis.
 
 2.  Expansile heterogeneous lytic lesion in the right anterior fifth rib is
 likely related to known history of myeloma.
