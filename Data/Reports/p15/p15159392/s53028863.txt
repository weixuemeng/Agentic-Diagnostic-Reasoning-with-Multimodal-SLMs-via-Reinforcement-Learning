                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with multiple myeloma with pneumonia/left
 lower lobe collapse.  Evaluate for re-expansion.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest of ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left-sided subclavian Port-A-Cath with its tip in the mid SVC, unchanged. 
 There is some interval improvement in aeration at the left base, but there is
 still residual retrocardiac opacity which could represent partial lower lobe
 atelectasis or pneumonia.  The left hemidiaphragm remains slightly elevated. 
 Right lung is grossly clear with the exception of a linear opacity medially
 which likely represents subsegmental atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or
 pulmonary edema is seen.  Overall cardiac mediastinal contours are stable with
 calcification of the aortic knob.  The previously described right fifth
 anterior rib expansile lesion is less well appreciated on today's examination.
