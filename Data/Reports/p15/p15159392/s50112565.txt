                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 new nasogastric tube.  The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the
 tube projects over the proximal parts of the stomach, the tube should be
 slightly advanced.  Despite the very proximal position of the tube, the
 overinflation of the stomach, present on the previous exam, is improved.
 
 Unchanged bilateral parenchymal opacities and small left pleural effusion with
 subsequent atelectasis.  Left pectoral Port-A-Cath in situ.  Unchanged
 moderate cardiomegaly.
