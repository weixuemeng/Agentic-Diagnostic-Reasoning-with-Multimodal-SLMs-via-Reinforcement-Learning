                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with multiple myeloma with increased work of
 breathing.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior exams, most recently CT torso of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions have enlarged since ___.  Worsening heterogeneous and linear
 bibasilar opacities are likely atelectasis but other etiologies such as
 aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded.  The heart size and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  The catheter of a left chest wall
 port, which has been accessed, terminates in the lower SVC.  Multiple
 vertebral body deformities are similar to prior, including vertebra plana of
 the upper thoracic vertebral body.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Worsening patchy and linear bibasilar opacities are most likely due to
 atelectasis, but aspiration and infectious pneumonia are also possible. 
 
 2.  Small enlarging bilateral pleural effusions.
