                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Bibasilar atelectasis is
 present and the left lung base is not well visualized, possibly due to
 atelectasis and portable technique, however an underlying infectious process
 cannot be completely excluded.  There is no evidence of overt pulmonary edema.
 No pneumothorax is present.  Multilevel spinal fusion surgical hardware is
 identified in the thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis, more prominent on the left. 
 Although opacification of the left lung base may be due to atelectasis,
 underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.
