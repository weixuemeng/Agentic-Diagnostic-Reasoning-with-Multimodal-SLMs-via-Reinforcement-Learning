                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea and cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
 cardiac silhouette has slightly increased in size.  There is increased
 bilateral opacification with perihilar predominance and peribronchial cuffing,
 consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac opacification may be
 related to edema; however, underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are present.  No pneumothorax.  Displaced and
 angulated fracture of the left mid clavicle is chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, mild pulmonary edema and
 increased small bilateral pleural effusions is consistent with cardiac
 decompensation.
 
 2.  Dense retrocardiac opacification could be related to edema; however,
 pneumonia is not excluded and repeat radiographs are recommended once the
 edema improves.
