                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope and associated head trauma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is again a convex contour of the right upper mediastinal margin as well
 as moderate unfolding and calcification along the aorta.  The heart is again
 at the upper limits of normal size.  There is mild hyperinflation.  Mild
 spinal degenerative changes appear stable.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is new vague hyperdense focus projecting along the
 anterior margin of the right fifth rib along the expected site of the
 costochondral junction.  This may be due to intercurrent, but not necessarily
 acute, injury involving the rib; it is also difficult to exclude a lung
 nodule.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.
 
 2.  New vague density projecting along the costochondral cartilage of the
 right anterior fifth rib, although the density also projects over the right
 lung and a lung nodule cannot be excluded.  Either dedicated right rib
 radiographs or consideration of chest CT is suggested to evaluate further when
 clinically appropriate.
 
 Findings and recommendations discussed with Dr. ___ at 2:50 pm on ___, by telephone.
