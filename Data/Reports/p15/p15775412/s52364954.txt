  1. Left IJ CVL tip within the left brachiocephalic vein.
  2. Persistent small to moderate left pleural effusion with retrocardiac
  opacity likely combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion however cannot
  exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cvl placement. Assess left IJ central venous line.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an enteric
 feeding tube coursing mid line with tip out of field of view. An endotracheal
 tube is in appropriate position with tip 3.5 cm above the level of the carina.
 Interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous catheter with tip
 at the left brachiocephalic vein just proximal to the confluence.
 
 Persistently hypoinflated lungs with vascular crowding and right lower lobe
 atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Persistent small to moderate left pleural
 effusion with retrocardiac opacity. Aortic arch calcifications noted.
 Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Left IJ CVL tip within the left brachiocephalic vein.
 2.  Persistent small to moderate left pleural effusion with retrocardiac
 opacity likely combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion however cannot
