  1. Interval increase in small to moderate left pleural effusion with
  retrocardiac opacity likely representing a combination of atelectasis and
  pleural effusion however cannot exclude superimposed pneumonia in the
  appropriate clinical setting.
  2. Heterogeneous opacity projecting over the left mid hemi thorax is most
  likely a combination of atelectasis and vascular crowding.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with altered mental status and hypotension. Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates
 persistently hypoinflated lungs with vascular crowding and right lower lobe
 atelectasis. No pneumothorax. No right pleural effusion. Interval increase in
 small to moderate left pleural effusion with retrocardiac opacity. New
 heterogeneous opacity projecting over the left mid hemi thorax. Persistent
 mild cardiomegaly which is partially obscured by left pleural effusion. Aortic
 arch calcifications noted. Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise
 unremarkable.
 
 Chronic deformity of the left clavicle again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval increase in small to moderate left pleural effusion with
 retrocardiac opacity likely representing a combination of atelectasis and
 pleural effusion however cannot exclude superimposed pneumonia in the
