  As compared to the prior studies from ___, there is persistent
  retrocardiac opacity which is likely a combination of pleural effusion and
  atelectasis. However, consolidation secondary to pneumonia cannot be excluded.
  The endotracheal tube has been pulled back and is a peripherally position.
  Left IJ CVL and OG tube unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with CAD, sCHF, moderate-severe MR, and PAH, recently
 discharged from ___ for CAP PNA, who p/w AMS in setting of fall, and is
 found to have lactate 8.6.  // Any interval change after ET tube replaced?    
 Any interval change after ET tube replaced?
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again increasing an
 cardiac size with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Retrocardiac
 opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe associated
 with pleural effusion. Nevertheless, in the appropriate clinical setting, a
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
 The endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 4 cm above the carina.
 Nasogastric tube coils in the upper stomach.
