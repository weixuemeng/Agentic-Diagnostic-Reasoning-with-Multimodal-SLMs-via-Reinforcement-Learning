                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Increasing confusion and falls.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Moderate unfolding and calcification
 along the aorta appear unchanged.  The chest appears hyperinflated.  There is
 a consolidation in the right lower lobe, most consistent with pneumonia.  A
 patchy anterior opacity is difficult to place on the frontal view, but is
 probably in the right middle lobe.  Elsewhere, however, the lungs appear
 clear.  The bones appear demineralized with similar moderate degenerative
 changes throughout the visualized thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with pneumonia, including a  consolidation in
 the right lower lobe.  Follow-up radiographs are recommended to show
 resolution within eight weeks.
