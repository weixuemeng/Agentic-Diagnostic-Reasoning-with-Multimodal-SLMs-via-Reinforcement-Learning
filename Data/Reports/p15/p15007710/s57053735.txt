                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with decreased bs right base, cough  // r/o
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable with moderate cardiomegaly, elongated
 tortuous aorta upper normal size and pulmonary arteries also upper normal
 size.  Opacity in the right lower lobe in the periphery is more conspicuous
 than before likely a rounded atelectasis are seen in the prior CT. Opacity
 adjacent to the descending aorta could be atelectasis but attention in
 followup studies is recommended. There is no pneumothorax.  There is probably
 small left effusion.  The left hemidiaphragm is elevated.  S-shaped scoliosis
 is again noted.
