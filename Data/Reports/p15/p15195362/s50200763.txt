                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ study.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is located within a tracheal stent, terminating
 above the thoracic inlet, with tip of the tube approximately 6 cm above the
 carina.  Widening of cardiomediastinal contours is stable in appearance
 allowing for marked patient rotation and low lung volumes.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion and perihilar edema are unchanged, as well as bilateral moderate
 pleural effusions and adjacent lower lobe opacities, which probably represent
 atelectasis based upon review of imaged portion of the chest from a CT of the
 neck, one day earlier.
