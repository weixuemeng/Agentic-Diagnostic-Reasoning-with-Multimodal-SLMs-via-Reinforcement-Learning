                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mediastinal mass and respiratory distress.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is a layering pleural effusion on the right, continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and probably some elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in
 the left lower lobe.
 
 Endotracheal tube remains in position and the large right mediastinal mass is
 again appreciated.
