                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumothorax in a patient with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an unchanged
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  There is again extensive bilateral pleural
 disease, with thickening and fibrosis at the lung apices.  Volume loss on the
 left is unchanged.  There is increased thickening in walls of chronic right
 apical cystic scarring and bronchiectasis.  There is likely a small left
 pleural effusion superimposed on chronic pleural thickening.  Increased
 opacity in the right lower lung is new, and is concerning for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased opacity in the right lower lung concerning for pneumonia versus
 atypical edema.
 2. Likely small left pleural effusion.
 3. Change in chronic cystic scarring and bronchiectasis, right upper lobe
 could either be due to colonization versus reactivation tuberculosis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephoneon ___ at 8:04 AM, 15 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
