                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 8:40 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath.  Assess for
 pulmonary pathology.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 12:44.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 8:40 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lung volumes are diminished.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle which likely reflects a small effusion.  Streaky opacities at both bases
 are suggestive of atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged, with the aorta being somewhat
 unfolded and tortuous.  Hardware overlies the mid-to-lower cervical spine.
