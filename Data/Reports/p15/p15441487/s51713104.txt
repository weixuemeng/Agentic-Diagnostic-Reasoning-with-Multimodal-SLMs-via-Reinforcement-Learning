 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is top normal.  There

 mild dextroscoliosis throughout the thoracic spine, which is stable.  The
 hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The aorta is
 moderately tortuous.  There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or
 pleural effusion.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
