                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs show obscuration of the right
 heart border, which more likely represents atelectasis.  However, there are
 very subtle opacities overlying the heart on the lateral view.  There is no
 definite focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacities described above may simply be atelectasis, but
 can be better charachterized with oblique views.
