                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with weakness, cough.  Evaluate for acute
 process, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Shoulder radiographs ___; chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low limiting assessment.  There is mild bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Bronchovascular crowding also noted in the perihilar region in
 the setting of low lung volumes.  No convincing signs of pneumonia, edema,
 large effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged
 allowing for differences in technique.  Again seen is a comminuted fracture of
 the surgical neck of the left humerus.  Again seen is chronic deformity of the
 distal right clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
