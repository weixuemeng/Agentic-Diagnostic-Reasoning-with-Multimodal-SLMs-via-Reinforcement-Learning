                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lung volumes are low.  No confluent
 consolidation is identified.  There are subtle interstitial opacities which
 may reflect early heart failure.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Apparent enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is likely secondary to the AP technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial prominence suggestive of early heart failure in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
