 lobectomy. There is interval development of right lower lobe aunts left
 perihilar and lower lobe opacities that might potentially reflect gradual
 development of pulmonary edema. Infectious process is another possibility.
 There is most likely present small amount of pleural effusion. A right apical
 pneumothorax is present, small.
