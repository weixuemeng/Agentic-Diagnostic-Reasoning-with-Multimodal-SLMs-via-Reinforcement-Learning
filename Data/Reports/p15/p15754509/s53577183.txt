                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:12 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Gastric resection.  Multiple intestinal perforations.  Right
 thoracentesis.  Question mucous plug.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion slightly smaller.  Small-to-moderate left
 pleural effusion and mild interstitial edema both unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
 The right pigtail catheter is folded several times at mid level in the right
 hemithorax and could be partially occluded.  Right lower lobe is partially
 obscured by the heart because of patient rotation.  There is some volume loss,
 but none appreciably changed since ___  Left lung is fully expanded and
 right upper and middle lobes are not atelectatic.
