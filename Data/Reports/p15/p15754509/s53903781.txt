                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Desaturation to mid 70s, on oxygen, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 There is markedly rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, no pneumothorax is
 detected.  Probable prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, similar to
 ___.  There is upper zone re-distribution, mild diffuse vascular blurring,
 small bilateral effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation,
 consistent with CHF.  The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting background COPD.
 
 
 Surgical clips overlie the lower chest and upper abdomen in the midline. 
 Surgical ___ are also present over the upper abdomen in the midline.  An
 NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film.  The sideport
 appears to lie in the region of GE junction.  A left subclavian central line
 is present, tip over mid/distal SVC. 
 
 Irregular lucency overlying the right shoulder may represent  subcutaneous
 emphysema -- this was better seen on the ___ radiograph.  Deformity of the
 left proximal humerus again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly and probable background COPD.  
 2.  CHF with bilateral effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 3.  No pneumothorax detected.
