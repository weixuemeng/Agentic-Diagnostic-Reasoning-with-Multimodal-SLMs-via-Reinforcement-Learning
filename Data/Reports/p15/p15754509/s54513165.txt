                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with perforated jejunum and diaphragm, status post repair,
 evaluate interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the
 patient in semi-upright position.
 
 Support and monitoring devices are in their appropriate positions and
 unchanged.  A left chest tube is in place with the tip projecting over the
 left apex.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are increased bibasilar opacities
 with small bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  There is again extensive subcutaneous emphysema involving the neck
 and the entire chest.  Pneumoperitoneum is less well seen.  There is an old
 left humeral head fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left chest tube in place without pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Increased bibasilar opacities with small bilateral pleural effusion,
 likely secondary to overhydration.
 
 3.  Stable extensive subcutaneous emphysema with improvement in
 pneumoperitoneum.
