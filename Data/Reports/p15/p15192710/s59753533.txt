                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pneumothorax, resolved
 after chest tube placement.  Follow up.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the
 same day earlier as well as one day before.
 
 There is no interval reoccurrence of pneumothorax.  Subcutaneous air is
 unchanged.  The left lower lobe opacity is slightly smaller, consistent with
 decreasing hematoma most likely.
