                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of acute myelocytic
 leukemia status post SCT (stem cell transplant?) with persistent leukocytosis.
 Questionable infectious disease, seeking for underlying pulmonary infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The chest findings are completely stable,
 and there is no evidence of new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates that could
 represent a pneumonia.  Heart size is also unchanged, and no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion or pleural effusion exists.  No pneumothorax in
 the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no evidence of new acute pulmonary
 infectious process that could account for unexplained leukocytosis.
