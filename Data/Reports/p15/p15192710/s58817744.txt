                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Recent pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___.
 
 Left apical pneumothorax is tiny if any.  The benefit of the lateral view.  We
 can see that although the large region of opacification in the left lower lung
 is improving.  There are actually two responsible abnormalities, a region of
 consolidation or atelectasis in the lingula, and a pleural collection in the
 left lower hemithorax adjacent to region of consolidation.  One or both of
 these lesions is presumably a hematoma from recent transbronchial biopsy.  PA
 and lateral views therefore are recommended for subsequent followup.  Right
 lung is clear.  The heart is normal size.
