                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with bronchiectasis and suspected pulmonary
 graft-versus-host disease.  Status post transbronchial biopsy.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 EXAMINATION:  Single frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Increased focal opacification demonstrated within the left lower lobe in
 setting of known transbronchial biopsy is likely related to focal hemorrhage
 superimposed on known area of focal opacification/though is out of proportion
 to expected.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Bronchiectasis of
 the left lower lobe is unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable demonstrating mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Heart size is
 within normal limits.  Incidentally noted is a benign bone island demonstrated
 within the left humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in opacification in the left lower lobe that in
 the setting of known transbronchial biopsy is likely related to hemorrhage
 superimposed on the known previously noted focal opacification, though
 aspiration and interval progression of the disease process are also
 possibilities.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
