                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with chest tube discontinued.
 
 AP chest radiograph is reviewed.
 
 As compared to the prior studies obtained the day earlier there is no interval
 development of substantial pneumothorax, although minimal amount of air cannot
 be excluded in the apex.  Left lower lobe opacity might represent organizing
 hematoma.  Subcutaneous air is unchanged.
