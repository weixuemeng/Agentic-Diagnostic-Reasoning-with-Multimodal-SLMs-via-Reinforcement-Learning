                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single portable erect AP view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of pneumothorax status
 post chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 20:22.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP erect portable view of the chest was obtained.  There has
 been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube which appears to terminate
 approximately at the level of the medial left diaphragm and may extend to the
 mediastinum.  There has been re-expansion of the left lung with opacity in the
 left mid-to-lower lung which could be due to pulmonary hemorrhage/contusion,
 partial collapse, or less likely infection.  Subcutaneous emphysema is seen
 along the left chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of left chest tube with reexpansion of the
 left lung, with opacity/consolidation in the left mid-to-lower lung fields
 with shift of the mediastinum to the left may be due to partial lung collapse,
 although underlying pulmonary contusion/hemorrhage is may be present.  The
 left chest tube appears to extend to the level of the medial left diaphragm
 and may encroach upon the mediastinum.  Left chest wall subcutaneous
 emphysema.
