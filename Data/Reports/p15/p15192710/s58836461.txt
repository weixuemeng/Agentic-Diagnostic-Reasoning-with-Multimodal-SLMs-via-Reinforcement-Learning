                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recent left pneumothorax, now with new
 pleuritic chest pain.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Subtle linear
 horizontally oriented opacities in the left costophrenic angle appear improved
 compared to prior exams and likely reflect the sequelae of resolving
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  A small left pleural effusion is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left pleural effusion and improving atelectasis, but no
 pneumothorax.
