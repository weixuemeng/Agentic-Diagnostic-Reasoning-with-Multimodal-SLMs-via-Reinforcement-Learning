 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, which is into the bronchovascular markings.  Given
 this, there may be minimal central pulmonary vascular engorgement without
 overt pulmonary edema.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings with possible minimal
 central pulmonary vascular engorgement.
