                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is a dual-lead pacemaker and a right IJ line with tip at
 the cavoatrial junction.  There are bilateral pleural effusions and volume
 loss in both lower lungs.  There are some patchy areas of alveolar infiltrate
 that are slightly increased compared to the prior study.  The overall
 impression is that of worsened fluid status.
