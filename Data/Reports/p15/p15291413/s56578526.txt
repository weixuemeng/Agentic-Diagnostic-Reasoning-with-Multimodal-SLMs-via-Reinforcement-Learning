                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with Stage 4 breast cancer here with new worsening
 right sided pain, known liver mets, now vomiting and on clinical trail
 protocol at ___  // New mass or hepatitis vs renal stone
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with overlying atelectasis. The
 elevated right hemidiaphragm is new since the prior study. Right-sided
 Port-A-Cath is seen terminating in the proximal right atrium. Incidental note
 is again made of an azygos lobe. There is slight blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle on the frontal view, not substantiated on the lateral view,
 and may relate to atelectasis. No focal consolidation is seen. No evidence of
 pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is new since the prior study.  Overlying
 right basilar atelectasis.  Please note that chest CT is more sensitive in
 detecting small pulmonary lesions and in evaluating previously noted
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
