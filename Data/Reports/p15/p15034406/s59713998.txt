                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea and wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is linear opacity in
 the left mid lung, which appears dense and likely calcified.  There are also
 associated likely calcified left hilar lymph nodes.  This is suggestive of
 previous granulomatous disease.  Linear opacity at the right lung base is also
 identified.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the aortic arch.
 No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of previous granulomatous disease in the left
 lung.  Streaky right basilar opacity most likely atelectasis although
 infection is also possible.
