                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with bilateral pleural effusions,
 status post right-sided thoracocentesis with 1.3 L drained, now with tachypnea
 and cough.  Obtain an expiratory film to assess for re-expansion of pleural
 edema versus pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study obtained approximately four hours earlier during the same day.  An AP
 single view chest examination has been performed and is similar in position in
 comparison with the next preceding film.  The right-sided pleural density has
 re-accumulated to a degree which is not significantly different from what
 existed prior to the thoracocentesis as demonstrated on the chest examination
 of ___.  
 
 The findings on the present portable single view examination cannot identify
 the degree of inspiration.  It is unclear to what extent and expiratory image
 could help to differentiate between re- expansion pleural edema versus
 pneumothorax.  On the portable chest examinations, there was no evidence of
 pneumothorax but the now recurring pleural effusion that took place during the
 last preceding four hours is quite obvious.  Left-sided appearance of pleural
 effusion is unchanged.
