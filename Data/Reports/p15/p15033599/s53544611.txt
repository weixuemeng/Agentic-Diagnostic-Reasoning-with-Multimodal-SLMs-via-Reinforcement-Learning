                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with recent pulmonary stent, presents with
 productive cough, question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___, CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are again noted to be hyperinflated, with flattening of
 the hemidiaphragms.  Bilateral pleural effusions are similar to perhaps
 slightly increased compared with prior.  There is new silhouetting of the
 right heart border likely reflecting right middle lobar atelectasis.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal in appearance.  There is mild interstitial
 thickening consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is
 normal in size, there is bilateral paratracheal lymphadenopathy, and there is
 calcification of the aortic knob.  A right chest pacemaker is in place, with
 atrial and ventricular leads in stable and appropriate position. Asymmetry of
 the breasts is consistent with prior surgery.
 
 Poor definition of the lumens of lower trachea and main bronchi suggests
 airway compromise requiring CT for imaging evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right middle lobe collapse. CT would be required to evaluate airway
 patency.
 
 2.  Mild CHF, with interstitial fluid and slight increase in bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 
 3.  Stable bilateral paratracheal lymphadenopathy.
