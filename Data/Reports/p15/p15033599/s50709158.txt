                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with B-cell lymphoma status post
 DA-EPOCH, critical aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease.  Status post DES,
 PICC-associated thrombus/superior vena cava syndrome who presented with
 failure to thrive.  Hospital course complicated by leukocytosis and ATN.  Now
 status post right-sided thoracocentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Moderate cardiac enlargement and position of
 previously described dual electrode system is unchanged.  The previously
 existing right-sided pleural effusion that blunted the right lateral pleural
 sinus has clearly improved, apparently related to the successful
 thoracocentesis.  Aeration of the right lower lobe is markedly improved. 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary congestion or pulmonary edema pattern.  On
 the left side, the amount of pleural effusion is stable in comparison with the
 preceding examination of ___.  No new parenchymal abnormalities have
 developed.  No pneumothorax is present on either side.
