 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Thoracocentesis, assessment for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone a
 right thoracocentesis.  Accordingly, right pleural effusion has decreased in
 extent and is barely visible on today's image.  The signs of interstitial
 fluid overload have also decreased.  There is no evidence of right
 pneumothorax.  However, effusion that pre-existed on the left has slightly
 increased in extent.  As a consequence, there is more retrocardiac atelectasis
 than previously seen.  Otherwise, no changes.
