                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with multiple comorbidities and right
 thoracentesis earlier the same day, now with worsening shortness of breath and
 crackles on exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___,
 ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate increased right basilar
 opacification suggestive of reexpansion pulmonary edema, given the patient's
 thoracentesis today.  The previously visualized pneumothorax is less
 conspicuous on this exam.  Large left pleural effusion is unchanged from prior
 imaging.  The right-sided PICC line and pacer wires appear in the expected
 positions, unchanged from prior imaging.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 cannot be evaluated due to obscuration by pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in right lung base opacity, suggestive of
 reexpansion pulmonary edema status post thoracentesis.  Previously visualized
 pneumothorax not as conspicuous on this exam.  Stable large left pleural
 effusion.
