                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with B-cell lymphoma status post right and
 left thoracentesis.  Evaluate for re-expansion pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently chest radiograph
 of the same day at 14:11 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single upright view of the chest was obtained.  Small biapical
 pneumothoraces are newly visualized since the prior exam.  There is no
 evidence for tension.  Bilateral pleural tubes are in similar position to
 prior.  Comparison of the size of bilateral pleural effusions is difficult due
 to positional differences, however the left effusion appears slightly
 increased, now moderate in size, and the right effusion appears slightly
 decreased.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to the study 1.5 hours
 prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Newly visualized small biapical pneumothoraces.
 
 2.  Change in pleural effusion size is difficult to assess due to positional
 differences.  The left pleural effusion appears slightly increased, now
 moderate, and the right pleural effusion appears slightly decreased, still
 moderate.
 
 Findings were communicated via phone call by ___ to Dr. ___
 at 16:56 on ___, five minutes after discovery of the findings
 at 16:51 p.m.
