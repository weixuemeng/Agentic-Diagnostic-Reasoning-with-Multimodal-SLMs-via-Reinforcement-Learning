                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with CHF and B-cell lymphoma, now with new
 PICC line.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate a right-sided PICC line
 with the tip at least in the superior SVC, although the course of the catheter
 cannot be followed beyond that point due to overlying pacemaker leads.  The
 tip is not within the right atrium.  If a precise location of the catheter tip
 is desired, oblique views could be considered, although these still may not
 provide the answer given that the PICC line and the pacemaker leads are within
 the same vessel.  Again seen are large bilateral pleural effusions and
 bibasilar atelectatic changes.  There is some improved lung volume over
 previous exam, but there is persistent elevated pulmonary vascular pressure. 
 There is no pneumothorax or other complication seen.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right-sided PICC line with tip at least in the superior SVC, but
 the tip cannot be localized on this view due to overlying pacer leads.
 
 These findings were communicated to the IV nursing team at 11:30 a.m. by
 phone.
