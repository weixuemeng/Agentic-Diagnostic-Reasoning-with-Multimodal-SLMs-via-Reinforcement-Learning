                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with AS, CAD, and B-cell lymphoma status post
 right thoracentesis yesterday, now requiring assessment for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate interval redevelopment
 of a right-sided pleural effusion.  The effusion forms an air-fluid level,
 suggesting persistent pneumothorax, even though pneumothroax was less
 conspicuous on previous exam than on the post-procedure exam.  There is
 interval worsening of the right lung base opacity, consistent with the
 reaccumulating right pleural effusion.  The large left pleural effusion
 remains unchanged from prior imaging.  The right-sided PICC line and pacer
 wires are again noted in the expected course, unchanged from previous imaging.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette can again not be characterized given obscuration
 by bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent pneumothorax with newly reaccumulating right pleural
 effusion with associated air-fluid level (hydropneumothorax).  Large left
 pleural effusion unchanged.
