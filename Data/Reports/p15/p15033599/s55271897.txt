                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with large cell lymphoma, PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Because of right-sided pacemaker leads, it is impossible to see the end of
 right-sided PICC line : it is followed up until mid to distal subclavian vein.
 The rest of the exam is unchanged with bilateral moderate pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 The end of right-sided PICC line cannot be assessed in this exam secondary to
 superposition with pacemaker leads.
