 INDICATION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, status post left thoracocentesis,
 rule out pneumothorax.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 left pleural drain.  The extent of the pre-existing left pleural effusion has
 slightly decreased.  There is no evidence of left pneumothorax.  On the right,
 the appearance of the hemithorax is unchanged.
