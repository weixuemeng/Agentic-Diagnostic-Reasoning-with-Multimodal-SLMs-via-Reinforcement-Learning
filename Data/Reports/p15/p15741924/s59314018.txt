 As compared to prior chest radiograph, small bilateral pleural effusions have
 improved.  Bibasilar atelectasis still remains. There is some engorgement of
 the hila, which could represent mild pulmonary congestion. There is no new
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits. No definite fracture identified.
