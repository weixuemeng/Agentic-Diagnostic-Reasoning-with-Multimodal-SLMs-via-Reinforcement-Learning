                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Also prior radiographs the chest dated ___ through ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views the chest demonstrate low lung volumes with
 resulting bronchovascular crowding.  Linear opacities within both lungs likely
 represent atelectasis or scarring.  There is mild enlargement of the hila and
 cephalization of pulmonary vasculature, consistent with mild interstitial
 edema.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  A right-sided
 pacemaker device is noted at the leads terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions are present.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is mild
 calcification of the aortic knob.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No focal consolidation.  
 
 2.  Mild interstitial edema with trace bilateral pleural effusions.  
 
 3.  Linear opacities within both lungs likely represent atelectasis or
 scarring.
