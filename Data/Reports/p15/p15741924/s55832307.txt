                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Heart size remains at least moderately enlarged,
 although the inferior aspect of the heart is not completely imaged on the
 frontal view.  The aortic knob remains calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are relatively unchanged with calcified lymph nodes again likely
 reflective of prior granulomatous disease.  Lung volumes are low.  There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures, with probable mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  Linear
 opacities within both lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax
 is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Bibasilar linear opacities likely reflect atelectasis.
