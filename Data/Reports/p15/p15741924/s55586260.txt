                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute onset chest pain and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 A dual-lead pacemaker is in place, with lead tips over right atrium and right
 ventricle.  There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, there does
 appear to be pulmonary vascular plethora and interstitial edema.  Possible
 minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis, with subtle patchy opacity at both bases. Mediastinal contours
 are unchanged compared with ___, with probable mild cardiomegaly and
 slight unfolding of the aorta. 
 
 Subtle tapered appearance of both distal clavicles is noted, without
 aggressive features and unchanged compared with ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Probable CHF, even allowing for low inspiratory volumes.
 
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  The possibility of early pneumonic infiltrate
 would be difficult to exclude in this setting.
