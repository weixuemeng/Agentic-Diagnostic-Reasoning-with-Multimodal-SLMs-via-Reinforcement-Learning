 which most likely terminates at the pylorus.  There is a NG tube,  positioned
 within the stomach.  Compared to the prior radiographs, bilateral pleural
 effusions appear slightly improved; however, this could be due to patient
 being positioning differences.  There is no pneumothorax or definite focal
