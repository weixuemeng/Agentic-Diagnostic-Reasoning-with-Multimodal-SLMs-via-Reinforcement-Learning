                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray of ___ as well as a reference
 outside chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  Azygous vein
 is distended at 1.5 cm in greatest transverse dimension, but has decreased in
 width since the prior radiograph of ___.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion has also improved, and previously present pleural effusions have
 nearly resolved.  Bibasilar opacities have substantially improved compared to
 the prior study with some residual patchy opacities remaining, partially
 obscuring the mid portions of the hemidiaphragms on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement since ___, with improved pulmonary
 vascular congestion, marked decrease in pleural effusions, and improving
 aeration of both lung bases.
