                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with elevated white blood cell count, question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable chest radiograph is limitted by low lung volumes
 and mild rotation.  Mild pulmonary edema has improved but there is now a small
 amout of fluid in the right minor fissure.  A left internal jugular catheter
 tip remains at the confluence of the left brachiocephalic and SVC.  Apparent
 worsening of cardiomegally is likely secondary to technique.
 
 FINDINGS:  Slight improvement in pulmonary edema.
