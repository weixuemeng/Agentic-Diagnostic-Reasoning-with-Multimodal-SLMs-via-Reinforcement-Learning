                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest, AP semi-upright portable.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, portable AP portable.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  The cardiac contours are not well
 delineated.  There is opacification of the right lower hemithorax suggesting a
 combination of atelectasis, possibly pneumonic consolidation and potentially
 pleural effusion although not well delineated.  Nonspecific patchy left
 infrahilar opacity is also noted.  Allowing for AP portable technique, there
 is no definite cardiac failure.  There is no evidence for pleural effusion on
 the left.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Basilar opacities, right greater than left, worrisome for
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Particularly on the right a
 pleural effusion is possible and cannot be excluded.
