                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath and hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 allowing for differences in technique.  There is predominantly perihilar
 opacification that is striking and new since the prior studies, suggesting
 pulmonary edema.  There is also increasing right basilar opacification, which
 may reflect a coinciding pleural effusion, but is not well characterized
 versus elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which could also be considered. 
 The area is not completely imaged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting moderate pulmonary edema.  Incompletely
 characterized right basilar opacification, which may reflect a pleural
 effusion, but is not well characterized.
