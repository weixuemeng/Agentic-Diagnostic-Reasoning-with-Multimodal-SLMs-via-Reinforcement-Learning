                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate for congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are increased interstitial markings with associated hilar
 fullness, consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  Increased
 opacification at the medial right base and in the retrocardiac space is most
 likely due to edema, though an underlying consolidation is difficult to
 exclude.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly, small bilateral pleural effusions, and
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  Basilar opacities are nonspecific and
 likely related to edema, but an underlying opacity is difficult to completely
 exclude.  Recommend a repeat radiograph after diuresis.
