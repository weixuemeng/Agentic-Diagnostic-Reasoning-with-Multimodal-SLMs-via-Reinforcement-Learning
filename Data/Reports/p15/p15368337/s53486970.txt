                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with hypotension shock found down now w hypoxia worsening //
 eval interval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from earlier the same day at 13:25.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Despite low lung volumes, there has been interval development of bilateral
 parenchymal opacities throughout the lung fields bilaterally, perhaps slightly
 worse on the left than the right.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly
 unchanged.  No displaced fractures identified.  Posterior lumbar fixation
 hardware is partially visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval development of bilateral parenchymal opacities throughout the lungs. 
 These findings may represent blossoming of bilateral infection, edema versus
 ARDS.
