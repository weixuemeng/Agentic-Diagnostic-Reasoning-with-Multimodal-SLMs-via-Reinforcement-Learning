                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with hypoxia s/p fall, ___, r tib plat fx, rhabdo / eval
 ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from earlier the same day at 14:14.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of endotracheal tube is seen with tip 3.8 cm from the
 carina.  Enteric tube seen with tip likely past the GE junction but with
 side-port in the distal esophagus.  Bilateral parenchymal opacities may have
 slightly progressed since prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of ET tube in appropriate position.  Enteric tube side port
 in the distal esophagus and should be advanced for optimal positioning.
 Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities again seen.
