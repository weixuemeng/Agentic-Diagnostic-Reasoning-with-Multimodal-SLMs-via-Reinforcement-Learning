                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with left upper abdominal pain and hyperglycemia  //
 ? pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Within this limitation, there is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Allowing for low lung volumes and
 projection, the cardiac size is top-normal and unchanged from prior
 examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
