                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  When compared to prior, there has been partial resolution of the
 bilateral parenchymal opacities seen on prior.  There is however persistent
 left basilar opacity.  Both could be due to atelectasis, aspiration or
 infection is also possible.  Blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle
 is suggestive of an effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess given
 differences in positioning and technique, but likely has not changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in the appearance of the lungs with some
 persistent left basilar opacity, potentially atelectasis versus
 aspiration/infection and small probable right pleural effusion.
