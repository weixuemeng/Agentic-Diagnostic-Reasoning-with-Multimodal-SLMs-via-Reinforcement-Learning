                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with right upper quadrant pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Relatively low lung volumes are seen.  There is, however, a
 confluent consolidation identified at the right lung base compatible with a
 right lower lobe pneumonia.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear noting some
 bronchovascular crowding due to low lung volumes.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe consolidation compatible with pneumonia in the
 proper clinical setting.
