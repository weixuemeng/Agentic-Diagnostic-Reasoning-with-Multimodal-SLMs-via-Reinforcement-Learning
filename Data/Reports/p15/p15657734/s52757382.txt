                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS  
 
 HISTORY:  Pre-operative evaluation; patient with lower back pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is slight volume loss at the left lung base with relative elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm and streaky opacification suggesting minor atelectasis.
 Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  Mild-to-moderate rightward convex
 curvature is centered along the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar opacification, most likely due to minor
 atelectasis and volume loss.
