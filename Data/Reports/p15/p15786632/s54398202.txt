                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated, transferred from an outside hospital.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position, terminating approximately 5.6
 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube is seen with the tip and side port within
 the stomach.  Heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Hazy opacity
 within the right lung base may relate to mild asymmetric pulmonary edema
 though infection is not excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no displaced fractures.  Contrast material is seen
 within the renal collecting systems bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube and enteric tube.
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Hazy opacity within the right lung base
 likely is related to asymmetric pulmonary edema, but followup radiographs are
 recommended as pneumonia is not excluded.
