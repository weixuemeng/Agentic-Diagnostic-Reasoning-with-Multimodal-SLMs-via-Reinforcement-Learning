                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old male smoker with COPD, OSA, and chronic cough who
 presents with increase of chronic cough with intermittant production of
 white/yellow sputum.  // Pneumonia?
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to prior study of ___, cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable. Lung volumes are lower, and the left hemidiaphragm contour appears
 less distinct on the lateral view compared to the previous exam.  Saber sheath
 trachea configuration is consistent with provided history of COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to low lung volumes. Repeat lateral radiograph with improved
 technique may be helpful to exclude the possibility of an early pneumonia at
 the left lung base.
