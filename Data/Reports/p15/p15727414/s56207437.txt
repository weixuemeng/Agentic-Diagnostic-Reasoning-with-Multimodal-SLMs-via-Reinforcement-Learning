 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities are noted within
 the lung bases, findings which could reflect atelectasis, however infection is
 not completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality
 is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis, but
 infection cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
