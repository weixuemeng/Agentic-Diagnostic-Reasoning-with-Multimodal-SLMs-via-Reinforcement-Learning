                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fevers, post-op.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Relatively low lung
 volumes are again noted.  There is a left basilar opacity which silhouettes
 portion of the hemidiaphragm.  Superiorly, the left lung and the right lung
 are clear.  There is also suggestion of trace right-sided effusion given
 blunting of the right posterior costophrenic angle.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged and likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity potentially due to a combination of
 effusion, atelectasis with possible superimposed infection.  Probable trace
 right pleural effusion.
