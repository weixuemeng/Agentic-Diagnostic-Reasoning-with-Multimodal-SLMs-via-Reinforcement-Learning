                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Oxygen requirement.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Relatively low lung volumes most likely
 account for the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  No
 definite vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.  Bibasilar atelectatic
 changes with possible small effusions.  Band of atelectasis is seen at the
 left base.
