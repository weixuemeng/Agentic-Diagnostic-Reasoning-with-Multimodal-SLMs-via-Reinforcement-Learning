                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with stent placed three days presents with decrease
 oral intake, difficulty swallowing
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the lower SVC unchanged.  Metallic
 stent within the distal esophagus straddling the gastroesophageal junction
 extends into the proximal stomach and appears in unchanged position.  Heart
 size remains mild to moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal hilar contours are. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are noted along with patchy opacities in the lung bases potentially
 atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Unchanged position of distal esophageal stent straddling the
 gastroesophageal junction.
 
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar opacities likely
 atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
