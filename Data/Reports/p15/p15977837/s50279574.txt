                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is apparent
 widening of the right paratracheal stripe, although probably due to rotation. 
 It is suspected that the appearance is unchanged when differences in technique
 are considered, but confirmation with a followup PA and lateral radiographs is
 recommended to demonstrate normal contours when clinically appropriate.  The
 lungs appear clear.  There is probably a very small left-sided pleural
 effusion and trace pleural effusion on the right, but not well demonstrated. 
 Bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspected trace pleural effusions.  Otherwise, no definite
 evidence of acute disease.  Apparent widening of right mediastinal contour,
 but probably due to rotation.  However, when clinically appropriate, followup
 PA and lateral radiographs are recommended to assess further.  Recommendations
 discussed with Dr. ___, ___ physician caring for the patient, at 4 pm on
 ___ by telephone.
