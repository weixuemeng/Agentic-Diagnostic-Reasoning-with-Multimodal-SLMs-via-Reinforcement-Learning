 INDICATION:  Fall ___ days ago, evaluate for infiltrate or rib fracture,
 localizing history provided.

 FINDINGS:  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No new acute rib
 fractures are seen.  Again noted are right-sided old healed rib fractures. 
 The mediastinum and heart are stably enlarged and there is mild vascular
 congestion.  A retrocardiac opacity likely represents a hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No displaced rib fracture
 seen, although if there is continued clinical concern, a dedicated rib series
 may be obtained.
