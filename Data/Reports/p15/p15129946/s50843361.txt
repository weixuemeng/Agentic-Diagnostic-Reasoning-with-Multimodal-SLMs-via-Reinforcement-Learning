                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and decreased oxygen saturation,
 question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There is opacity at the left lung base laterally, also
 seen on the lateral view compatible with atelectasis versus infiltrate. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs are clear of confluent consolidation but notable for
 prominent central indistinct vascular markings.  Small effusion is noted on
 the left.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.    Osseous structures
 again notable for posterior right rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity, potentially due to atelectasis versus
 consolidation and probable trace effusion.  Findings suggestive of pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
