                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of shortness of breath.  Please evaluate for interval
 change in pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  There is mild central vascular pulmonary
 engorgement.  The lung fields demonstrate diffuse nodular opacities.  The lung
 fields bilaterally also demonstrate diffuse confluent hazy opacities.  There
 appears to be an interval increase in focal consolidation along the mid right
 lung field.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Overall, slight interval increase in diffuse hazy opacities throughout the
 lungs bilaterally concerning for slight interval worsening of the pulmonary
 edema.  
 
 2. Nodular opacities throughout the lung fields could also raise concern for
 septic emboli.  
 
 3. Focal consolidation in the right upper lobe raises concern for a
 superimposed infectious process.
 
 A CT is recommended for further evaluation.
