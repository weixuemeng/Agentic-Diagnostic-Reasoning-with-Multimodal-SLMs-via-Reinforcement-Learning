  1. Low lung volumes with obscuration of the bilateral hemidiaphragms likely
  due to a combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis, however developing
  consolidation at the lung bases cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
  setting.
  
  2. Mild cardiomegaly. Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and mild
  interstitial edema.
