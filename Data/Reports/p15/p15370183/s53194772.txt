                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Again noted is mild prominence of the upper
 mediastinum.  This is unchanged from prior exams.  A recent CT of the chest
 showed no mediastinal abnormalities and it is likely related to the
 orientation of the vasculature.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
