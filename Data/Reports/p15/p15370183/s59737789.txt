                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Liver disease, lower extremity edema.  Evaluate for volume
 overload.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  There is a new moderate right pleural effusion, with
 associated middle/lower lobe atelectasis.  Small amount of fluid tracks into
 the minor fissure.  Left lung is well expanded and clear.  New enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette.  Mild central venous congestion.  Calcifications of
 the aortic arch.  Bilateral acromioclavicular arthropathy.  Multilevel
 bridging right lateral osteophytes in the lower thoracic spine.

 1.  Moderate right pleural effusion, with middle/lower lobe atelectasis.
 
 2.  New cardiomegaly may reflect volume overload, pericardial effusion, and/or
 artifact from adjacent atelectasis.  Please correlate clinically.
