                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with liver failure, s/p albumin, now becming
 slightly more hypoxic  // eval for worsening edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with resultant accentuation of
 bronchovascular and cardiomediastinal structures. There is a small left
 pleural effusion with associated left basilar opacification. There is no
 significant pulmonary vascular engorgement. The mediastinum is prominent in
 part due to unfolding of the thoracic aorta. There is minimal calcification of
 the aortic knob. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion with associated left basilar opacification, which
 in the setting of low lung volumes may represent atelectasis.
