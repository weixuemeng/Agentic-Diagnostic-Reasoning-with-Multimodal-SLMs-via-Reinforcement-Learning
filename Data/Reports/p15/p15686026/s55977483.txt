                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:   Jaundice, chills. Assess for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates hypoinflated lungs with
 crowding of vasculature and bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. Heterogeneous
 opacity within the right lower lobe is worrisome for pneumonia.  Heart size is
 obscured due to patient positioning and low lung volumes. Mediastinal contour
 and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heterogeneous right lower lobe opacity is worrisome for pneumonia or
 aspiration pneumonia.
