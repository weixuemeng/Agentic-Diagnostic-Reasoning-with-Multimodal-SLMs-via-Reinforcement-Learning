                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with chest pain, GI bleed.  Assess for pneumonia and CHF.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.  Blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle is largely unchanged since prior exam,
 suggestive of small pleural effusion and/or pleural thickening.  There is no
 right pleural effusion.  No focal consolidation is seen.  Subtle linear
 opacities in the left mid lung ___, ___ represent areas of scarring.  Hilar
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  There is
 no pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Partially imaged upper abdomen
 is unremarkable.  Areas of pleural calcifications are best seen on the lateral
 view, suggestive of prior asbestos exposure.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle, suggestive of small
 pleural effusion and/or pleural thickening.
