                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with metastatic colon cancer, status post recent
 port placement and inability to draw blood.  Evaluate for placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are poorly inflated, but there are no focal opacities
 bilaterally.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Left sided pleural thickening is again
 noted with mild associated rounded atelectasis. A Port-A-Cath port is noted in
 the right thoracic wall, with the catheter ending very low in the right
 atrium, likely pressed against the wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  A right-sided
 Port-A-Cath catheter ends very low in the right atrium, with the tip likely
 pressing aginst the wall. Withdrawing the catheter 4 cm would still have the
 tip located in the right atrium.
