                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of malignancy with malaise and
 poor p.o. intake.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided port is visualized with the catheter tip at the level
 of the right ventricle.  Again noted is blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle suggestive of a small pleural effusion or pleural thickening, stable in
 comparison to prior study.  Subtle linear opacities in left mid lung are again
 noted and likely representative of scarring. The lungs are otherwise clear
 with no evidence of focal consolidation, right-sided effusion or pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Pleural calcifications are
 again noted, suggestive of prior asbestos exposure.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 2.  Persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggestive of pleural
 thickening versus a small pleural effusion.
 3.  Evidence of prior asbestos exposure.
 4.  Right-sided port with the catheter tip likely in right ventricle.
