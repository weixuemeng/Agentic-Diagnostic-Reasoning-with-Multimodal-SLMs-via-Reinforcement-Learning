                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Orthostatic hypotension, assess for pneumonia; recent
 diagnosis of colon cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A right chest
 wall Port-A-Cath is seen with catheter tip extending into the region of the
 right atrium.  In comparison with the prior radiograph of the chest, there is
 persistent retrocardiac density, though there is slight improvement in overall
 aeration of the left lower lung compared with prior exam.  Slight prominence
 of the right pulmonary hilum with perihilar linear markings suggesting
 retraction and scarring is again noted.  No pleural effusion on the right. 
 There may be a small left effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Interval resolution of
 pneumoperitoneum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration at the left lung base with persistent opacity
 likely representing atelectasis, possibly with small effusion.  Stable
 appearance of right hilar prominence with perihilar scarring/retraction.
