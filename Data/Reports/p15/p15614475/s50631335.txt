                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SI and attempt, infectious work-up  // Eval for
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy left
 basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis or scarring, unchanged.  Mild blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle could suggest the presence of a trace pleural
 effusion.  No new focal consolidation is present.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent left basilar patchy opacity which may reflect atelectasis or
 scarring.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus could suggest the
 presence of a trace left pleural effusion.
