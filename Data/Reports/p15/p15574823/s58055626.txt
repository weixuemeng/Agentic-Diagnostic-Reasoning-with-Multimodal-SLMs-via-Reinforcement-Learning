                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not substantially changed from
 the prior study.  The aorta remains mildly tortuous and diffusely calcified. 
 Moderate alveolar pulmonary edema is worse in the interval with small
 bilateral pleural effusions noted.  More focal opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe cardiomegaly with moderate pulmonary edema, worse in the interval, and
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
