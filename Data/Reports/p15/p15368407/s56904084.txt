                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough, nausea,
 vomiting, fever, diabetes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings, particularly
 at the lung bases.  Given this, slight medial right base opacity more likely
 represents vascular structures and atelectasis rather than consolidation.  The
 left lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
