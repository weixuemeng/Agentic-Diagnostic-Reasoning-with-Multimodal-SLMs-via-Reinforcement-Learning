                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman.  Evaluate effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Very small pleural effusions have improved over the past several days.  Severe
 cardiomegaly is chronic.  Previous pulmonary vascular engorgement and
 borderline edema have also resolved.  No pneumothorax.  Left PIC line ends in
 the mid-to-low SVC.  The bulbous character of the right hilus has been a
 constant feature on all chest radiographs since ___.  I would evaluate this
 structure with routine oblique views to confirm that it is probably just a
 variant vasculature rather than a mass.
