                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and dyspnea, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph performed earlier the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the bilateral
 hemidiaphragms compatible with COPD.  There is prominence of the right
 perihilar region.  Opacification of the right medial lung base corresponds to
 opacification of the cardiac silhouette on the corresponding lateral view.  No
 significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contours are prominent, due in part to unfolding and tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  Calcification of the aortic arch is noted.  The trachea is
 midline.  There is no free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 There are compression fracture deformities of the mid thoracic spine and
 generalized loss of height of the thoracic vertebral bodies with multilevel
 degenerative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable right middle lobe pneumonia or, less likely, collapse in
 the setting of background COPD.  Followup is recommended in ___ weeks
 following an appropriate course of treatment to confirm resolution.
