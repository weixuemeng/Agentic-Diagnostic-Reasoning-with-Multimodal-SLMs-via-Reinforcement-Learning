 CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Small-bowel obstruction.  Abdominal pain.  Check NG tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Air-fluid levels are seen in
 non-dilated loops of small bowel in the left upper quadrant with some gas in
 the colon.  The lungs are clear without infiltrate or effusion.  Volume loss
 at both bases.  The appearance of bowel could be due to early or partial SBO.
