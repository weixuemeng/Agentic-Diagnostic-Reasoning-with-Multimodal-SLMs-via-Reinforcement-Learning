                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Vomiting.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The left hemidiaphragm appears
 elevated.  Linear densities at the left base likely reflect compressive
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits. A small focus of air within the left upper
 quadrant is likely the post-bypass stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Elevated left hemidiaphragm with adjacent atelectasis.
