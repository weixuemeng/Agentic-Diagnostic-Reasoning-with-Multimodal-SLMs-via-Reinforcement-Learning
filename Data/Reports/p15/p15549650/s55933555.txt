                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia and altered mental status. 
 Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There is bilateral hilar
 indistinctness consistent with central vascular engorgement but no overt
 pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the right cardiophrenic angle as well as
 in a paramediastinal location in the left mid lung are seen. Loss of
 definition of the vessels in the retrocardiac region is also apparent.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged
 from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Patchy opacities in both lungs as previously described may be de to
 infection in the appropriate clinical setting. PA and lateral chest
 radiographs would aid in further assessment if the patient can tolerate it.
 2.  Bilateral hilar engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
