                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, status post intubation.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 19:35 p.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film, an ET tube has been placed, tip approximately
 4.7 cm above the carina.  An NG tube has also been placed, tip beneath
 diaphragm, off film.
 
 Rotated positioning. Since the prior film, there has been progression of the
 opacities in the right and left lungs.  On the right, the opacity is centered
 in the right base.  On the left, the opacity involves the upper, mid and lower
 zones, reflecting dense alveolar opacities.  Upper zone redistribution, but no
 overt CHF.  Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles, but no gross
 effusion.   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged, allowing for
 rotation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes as described.
 
 2.  Considerable progression of the bilateral infiltrates, now with dense
 bilateral alveolar opacities.  Differential diagnosis includes multifocal
 pneumonia. ARDS could have a similar appearance.
