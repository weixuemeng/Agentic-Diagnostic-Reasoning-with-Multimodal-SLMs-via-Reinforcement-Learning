                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure, rule out pneumothorax after central line
 attempt.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray at 00:42 a.m.
 
 Rotated positioning.  No significant pneumothorax is identified.  The
 possibility of a very tiny left apical pneumothorax cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Otherwise, no significant change is detected compared with the film
 obtained earlier the same day.  Dense patchy bilateral alveolar infiltrates
 are again noted.  ET and NG tubes are also again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible tiny left apical pneumothorax.  Attention to this area
 on followup films is requested.  
 
 Please see report of chest x-ray obtained at 13:06 p.m., later the same day.
