                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Epilepsy, increased seizures, evaluation for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing opacities
 at the lung bases are seen in unchanged manner.  On the left, the opacity
 appears to be caused by an area of fibrosis.  On the right, the opacity is
 overlaying the rib crossing and could be projectional.  Neither the right nor
 the left opacity suggest acute pneumonia.  Otherwise, normal lung parenchyma. 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.
