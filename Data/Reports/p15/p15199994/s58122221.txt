                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recurrent seizures.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of the previously placed left-sided
 PICC line.  The heart size and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. 
 The lungs are clear.  There is no large pneumothorax and subtle blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle may represent pleural thickening, especially given
 the lateral rib irregularities of the left hemithorax, compatible with prior
 old/healed rib fractures.
  
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
