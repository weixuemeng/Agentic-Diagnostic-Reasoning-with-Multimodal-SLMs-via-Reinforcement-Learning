                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of aspiration pneumonia,
 now with fever, has right upper lobe opacity on latest chest examination,
 unclear if pneumonia versus pneumonitis pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  The on previous examination described hazy
 parenchymal densities in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe persist
 and may even have increased slightly.  There are no other new abnormalities
 present.  The previously described multiple old right-sided rib fractures and
 pleural scar formations on the left base remain unchanged.  Observed multiple
 semi-linear lines traversing the upper thorax bilaterally.  They should not be
 confused with a pneumothorax but most likely represent skin folds in this
 patient examined in semi-erect recumbent position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe hazy ground-glass densities persist. 
 Differential diagnosis between pneumonitis and aspiration pneumonia cannot be
 decided on this portable single view examination, but must be supported by
 clinical findings.
