                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recurrent seizures, which are increased in frequency.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged and within normal limits.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Left basilar pleural thickening and linear
 opacification in the left lung base compatible with fibrosis appear unchanged
 compared to the prior study.  No new areas of parenchymal opacification are
 present.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax demonstrated.  Multiple
 old bilateral rib fractures are again visualized.  Multilevel degenerative
 changes within the thoracic spine are redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change from the prior study.  No new
 areas of parenchymal opacification to suggest pneumonia.
