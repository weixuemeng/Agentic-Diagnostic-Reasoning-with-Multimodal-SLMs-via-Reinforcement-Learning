                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate NG positioning.  The patient has a history of recurrent
 aspiration pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Series of chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest and upper abdomen
 demonstrates that the nasogastric tube courses into the stomach, loops on
 itself, and terminates in the cardiac fundus.
 
 The lung apices are not imaged.  Aside from minimal left basilar atelectasis,
 the imaged lung fields are clear.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours
 are normal.  There is no pleural effusion and no large pneumothorax, although
 assessment is limited by the lack of coverage of the apices.  Pulmonary
 vascular markings are normal.  There is residual contrast within the colon. 
 Multiple healed bilateral rib fractures are redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The nasogastric tube loops on itself once within the stomach and
 terminates in the gastric fundus.
