                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with epilepsy, aspiration  // query PNA, other
 process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a massive increase in lung
 volumes, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  An area of not
 characteristic scarring at the left lung bases thereby becomes visible.
 Although overlying pneumonia is unlikely, the finding should undergo short
 term radiographic followup.
