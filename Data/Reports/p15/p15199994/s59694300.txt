                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with epilepsy  // decreased R sided breath sounds
 decreased R sided breath sounds
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the immediate prior study of ___, mild pulmonary
 edema has resolved. Persistent heterogeneous opacification of the left base is
 most likely atelectasis related to low lung volumes.  If infectious symptoms
 develop, repeat radiographs to assess for developing pneumonia are
 recommended. There is mild atelectasis at the right base. Multiple, bilateral,
 old, well healed rib fractures are noted. There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The heart size is stably top-normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Resolved mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Persistent left base opacification is likely atelectasis, although
 superimposed pneumonia cannot be fully excluded.
