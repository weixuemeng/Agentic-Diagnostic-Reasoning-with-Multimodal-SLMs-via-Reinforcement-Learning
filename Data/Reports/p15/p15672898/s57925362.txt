                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, now with sore
 throat and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is subtle increased density in the
 right lung base which may have been present on prior radiographs, though is
 more apparent on the current examination, so pneumonia or potentially residual
 atelectasis or scarring could be considered.  The remainder of the lungs are
 clear.  There is no vascular congestion, edema, or large pleural effusions. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are enlarged, though unchanged from
 prior.  There has been interval removal of the left-sided central venous
 catheter.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle right lower lobe opacity which could reflect pneumonia in
 appropriate clinical circumstance.
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the above findings to Dr. ___ at 1:37 p.m. on
 ___.
