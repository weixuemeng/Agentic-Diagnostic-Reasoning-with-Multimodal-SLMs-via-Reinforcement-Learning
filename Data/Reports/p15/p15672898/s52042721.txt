                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Mediastinal mass, status post intubation, evaluation for interval
 changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 10:12 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the endotracheal
 tube is unchanged.  The tube projects approximately 5 cm above the carina. 
 Also unchanged is the course of the nasogastric tube and the course and
 position of the left internal jugular vein catheter.  Unchanged widening of
 the mediastinum and moderate cardiomegaly.  As noted in the previous report,
 the presence of pericardial effusion should be excluded with echocardiography.
 
 The pre-existing right pleural effusion is distributed in a slightly different
 manner, but overall unchanged in extent.  Mild bilateral basal atelectasis. 
 No pneumothorax.
