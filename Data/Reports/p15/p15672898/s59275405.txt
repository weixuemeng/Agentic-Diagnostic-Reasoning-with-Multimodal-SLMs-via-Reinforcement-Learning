                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Mediastinal mass, status post thoracocentesis on the right,
 evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 right thoracocentesis.  The extent of the right pleural effusion has
 decreased; however, a mild basal effusion persists.  Subsequent areas of
 atelectasis in both lung bases.  No evidence of right pneumothorax.  Unchanged
 moderate cardiomegaly with triangular shape of the cardiac silhouette.  The
 presence of pericardial effusion should be excluded via echocardiography.
 
 The course and position of the monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
