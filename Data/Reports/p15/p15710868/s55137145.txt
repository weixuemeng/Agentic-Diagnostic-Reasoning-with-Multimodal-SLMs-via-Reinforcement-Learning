                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural biopsy.  Evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates a left chest tube has
 been inserted and terminates in standard position.  The left pleural effusion
 has resolved.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Median sternotomy
 wires are again noted.  Subtle lucency along the left hemidiaphragm raises
 question of possible pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolved left pleural effusion with chest tube in place. 
 Possible tiny left pneumothorax.
