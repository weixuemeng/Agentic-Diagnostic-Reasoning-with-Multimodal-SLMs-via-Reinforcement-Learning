                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right subclavian PICC line has been removed.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There is continued opacification at the right base that has
 somewhat decreased.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with substantial
 volume loss in the left lower lobe with pleural effusion.
