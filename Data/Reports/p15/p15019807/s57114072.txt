                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  CHF.  Elevated white count and hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous left lower lobe consolidation may have improved minimally.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is no longer as engorged but cardiac silhouette is still very
 large.  Small left pleural effusion is probably still in place.  Widening of
 the upper mediastinum is due to a combination of fat deposition and generally
 large head and neck vessels, particularly the innominate artery.  Transvenous
 right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
