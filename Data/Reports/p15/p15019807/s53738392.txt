                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, bilious vomiting and aspiration.  Evaluate
 recent NG tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest was obtained with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___, findings
 CT thorax dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Contrary to the stated indication, there is no nasogastric tube identified. 
 As compared to the prior examination, there has been a mild interval increase
 in the opacification of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe, concerning
 for potential aspiration versus infectious etiology. Redemonstrated is a
 persistent, left basilar opacity which obscures the left hemidiaphragm, and
 likely correlates with the patient's known loculated effusion.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax or overt pulmonary edema identified.  Stable, mild
 cardiomegaly is noted.  A triple lead pacer device is seen overlying the left
 chest, with its corresponding leads unchanged in position.  The patient is
 postoperative with median sternotomy wires noted to be well-aligned.  There is
 a VP shunt catheter again seen projecting over the right chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No radiographic evidence for NG tube placement. 
 
 2.  Increasing opacification of the right middle and right lower lobes,
 concerning for aspiration versus pneumonia. 
 
 3.  Stable, loculated left pleural effusion .
