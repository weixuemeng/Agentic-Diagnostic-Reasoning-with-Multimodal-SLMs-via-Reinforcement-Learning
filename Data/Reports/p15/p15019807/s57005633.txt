                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of pacemaker lead placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior study.  The leads of a left pectoral pacer follow their expected courses
 to the right atrium, right and left ventricles.  Small left pleural effusion
 and mild left basilar atelectasis are unchanged.  Otherwise, the lungs are
 clear without pulmonary edema or vascular engorgement. There is no
 pneumothorax.  Moderate-to-severe cardiac enlargement is chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left pectoral pacer leads end in the expected locations of the right
 atrium, right ventricle and left ventricle.
 2.  Small left pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis are unchanged.
 3.  Moderate-to-severe cardiac enlargement is chronic.
