                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pacemaker lead revision.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Since ___ left ventricular pacer lead has been repositioned more
 inferiorly along the posterior wall of the left ventricle.  Transvenous right
 atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their respective
 positions.  There is no pulmonary edema or right pleural effusion.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is stable.  No pneumothorax.  As of ___ a torso CT
 showed a moderate and possibly loculated left pleural effusion.  There is
 still abnormality at the base of the left hemithorax, which obscures the
 diaphragmatic pleural contour.  Some of that is pleural effusion.  How much
 atelectasis is also present is difficult to assess, and might be revealed by
 oblique chest radiographs.  A definitive determination would require repeat
 chest CT scanning.
