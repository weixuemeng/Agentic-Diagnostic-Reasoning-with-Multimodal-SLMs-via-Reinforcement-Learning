  Large bibasilar opacities likely due in part to pleural effusions. Additional
  regions of parenchymal consolidation could be combination of atelectasis or
  potentially infection. Given more rounded configuration of some of the
  opacities in the lung parenchyma followup will be necessary to exclude
  underlying mass lesions.
