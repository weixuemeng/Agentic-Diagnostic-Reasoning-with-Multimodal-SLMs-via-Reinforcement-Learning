                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with enterococcus bacteremia, lung nodules, RML
 infiltrate with worsened cough  // eval for progression of infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:05
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  Known mediastinal and hilar nodes are not well appreciated
 radiographically.  Left-sided pacemaker with lead tips over the right atrium
 and right ventricle noted.
 
 Multiple nodules an opacities seen on the chest CT from ___ are poorly
 visualized by radiograph.  On today's exam, there is a faint small patchy
 opacity in the right mid zone laterally, above a slightly thickened minor
 fissure;  some patchy opacity at the right base, with blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle ; and minimal patchy opacity at the left base.  Findings at
 the right base are more pronounced and could represent early superimposed
 pneumonic infiltrate.  The right midzone left base opacities are similar to
 the prior film.  The prominent rounded density previously seen over the right
 lower lung is no longer visualized and, itself, may have represented a nipple
 shadow.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Patchy opacity at the right base has increased compared with both the ___ radiograph and with targeted review of the ___ chest CT. 
 This could therefore represent an early pneumonic infiltrate or possibly an
 early area of aspiration pneumonitis.
 2. Scattered irregular and nodular opacities are seen in both lungs, though
 the radiographic findings are much more subtle than on the recent CT scan.
