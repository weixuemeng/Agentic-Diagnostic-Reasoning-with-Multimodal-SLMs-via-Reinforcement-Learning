                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ and ___..
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperinflated.  The previously seen subtle density
 projecting over the right upper lung is unchanged.  A small opacity that
 projects over the right lower lung is new.  There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  A left pectoral dual-chamber pacemaker and
 its leads project in unchanged location.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New focal right middle lobe opacity and unchanged right upper lung opacity. 
 Given these equivocal findings for an infectious process with a right lower
 lobe nodule seen on CT, chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT is recommended for further evaluation of right
 lung opacities.
