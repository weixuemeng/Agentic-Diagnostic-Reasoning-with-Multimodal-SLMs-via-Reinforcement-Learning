                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, SOB, COPD // r/o PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left pectoral dual-lead pacemaker sends leads to the right atrium and right
 ventricle, although the right pacer lead has an unusual configuration.  There
 is an airspace opacity projecting over the lower spine on the lateral
 radiograph, and a faint nodular opacity in the right upper lobe.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated. There is no pneumothorax. Mild blunting of the costophrenic
 angles there is most likely due to trace pleural effusions or thickening.  The
 heart and mediastinum are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multiple subtle abnormalities as described above, none of which are diagnostic
 for pneumonia.  Repeat radiographs including bilateral oblique views may be
 helpful to determine if these abnormalities are persistent, and indicate true
 pathology.
