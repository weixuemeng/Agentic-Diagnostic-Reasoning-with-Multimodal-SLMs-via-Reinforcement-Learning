                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dizziness and lightheadedness.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  When compared to prior, there has been no significant
 interval change.  The lungs are clear of confluent consolidation.  Minimal
 left basilar opacity abutting the cardiophrenic angle persists, potentially
 due to atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs remain clear.  There is no effusion.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are again notable for anterior cervical spine fixation hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
