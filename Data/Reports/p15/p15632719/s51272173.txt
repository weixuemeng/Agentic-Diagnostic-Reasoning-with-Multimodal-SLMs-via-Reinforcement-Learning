                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, fatigue  // evaluate for pneumonia,
 acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral pulmonary opacities are again seen consistent with known pulmonary
 metastases, which are now subtly more conspicuous. Right pleural effusion
 appears similar to possibly slightly increased in extent. There is also slight
 increase in confluence of bibasilar opacities which may be due to worsening of
 metastatic disease, underlying consolidation not excluded. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
