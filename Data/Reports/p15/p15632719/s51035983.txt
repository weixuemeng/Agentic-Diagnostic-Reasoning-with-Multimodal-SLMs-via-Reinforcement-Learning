  Overall, allowing for differences in technique, there is stable appearance of
  known lung masses as compared to prior chest CT. No definite new focal
  consolidation identified however, superimposed infectious process of known
  masses cannot be entirely excluded. Small right -sided pleural effusion
  appears slightly increased in size.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and confusion. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is redemonstration
 of multiple lung masses which appear similar as compared to prior chest CT.
 There is a small sized right-sided pleural effusion, which allowing for
 differences in technique, appears slightly increased in size since prior chest
 CT. The left costophrenic angle is clear. There is no pneumothorax. No
 definite new focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. However, a small
 superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall stable appearance of known lung masses as compared to prior chest CT.
 No definite new focal consolidation identified however small superimposed
 infections may not be visualized given extensive bilateral opacities. Small
 right -sided pleural effusion appears slightly increased in size.
