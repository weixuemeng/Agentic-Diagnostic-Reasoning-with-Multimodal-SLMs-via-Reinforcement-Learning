                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post thoracoscopy.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  Right apical pneumothorax is tiny and right
 pleural tubes are in stable position.  Slight interval increase of right base
 opacity is likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion.  Multiple
 bilateral nodular metastases are similar to prior.  Lung volumes are low,
 exaggerating heart size.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Tiny right apical pneumothorax with right pleural tubes in similar position. 
 Interval increase in right base atelectasis and effusion.
