                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of known metastatic pulmonary disease, now with cough.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with CT chest from ___ and chest
 radiographs from ___ and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral images of the chest.  
 
 Multiple opacities are again seen in the bilateral lungs, consistent with
 known metastatic disease and grossly stable.  No definite new opacity is seen
 to suggest pneumonia, however cannot exclude an infectious process in the
 presence of the multiple lung opacities.  A loculated right pleural effusion
 is seen, similar prior exam.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from
 prior exam.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Multiple pulmonary opacities, consistent with known metastatic disease,
 without significant interval change.  No definite new opacity, but cannot
 entirely exclude pneumonia in the presence of the multiple lung opacities.
