                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Postoperative day #1 left debulking nephrectomy, with new oxygen
 requirement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion slightly larger, following removal of
 the right pleural tube.  Right lower lobe atelectasis, more severe than left,
 both worsened.  Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess, and therefore
 pericardial effusion difficult to exclude.  Bilateral lung nodules and central
 adenopathy is essentially stable.  Small pneumoperitoneum, presumably
 postoperative.
