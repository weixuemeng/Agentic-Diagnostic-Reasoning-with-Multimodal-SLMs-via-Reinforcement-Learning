                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  There is persistent left lung base
 heterogeneous opacity, which obscures left hemidiaphragm.  There is slight
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggestive of trace pleural effusion. 
 Trace right pleural effusion is also likely.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart size is normal.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent heterogeneous left lung base opacity, which may represent
 atelectasis, aspiration or infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
