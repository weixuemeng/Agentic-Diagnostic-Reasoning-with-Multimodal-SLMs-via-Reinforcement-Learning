                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  AFib
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  There are low lung
 volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Slight blunting of the costophrenic angles likely relates to low
 lung volumes, although trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. 
 Right perihilar opacity is seen, which could be due to underlying
 consolidation, prominent vasculature, underlying mass is not excluded. 
 Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation.  Old
 right-sided rib fracture is again seen.  Cardiac silhouette remains mildly
 enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right ___/suprahilar opacity is nonspecific, could be due to
 consolidation, prominent vascular structure; however, underlying mass is not
 excluded.  Dedicated PA and lateral views with deeper inspiration would be
 helpful.  If finding persists, consider chest CT.
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Slight blunting of the costophrenic angles could be
 due to low lung volumes and pleural thickening, although trace pleural
 effusions are difficult to exclude.
