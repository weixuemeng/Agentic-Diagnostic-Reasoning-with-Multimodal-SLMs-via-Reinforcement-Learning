                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Crackles on examination, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the left hemidiaphragmatic
 contour is silhouetted, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left
 lower lobe and pleural effusion.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is
 consistent with small effusion and there are mild atelectatic changes at the
 bases.
 
 The low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  The
 apparent pulmonary congestion on one view probably also is a manifestation of
 low lung volumes rather than appreciable elevation of the pulmonary venous
 pressure.
