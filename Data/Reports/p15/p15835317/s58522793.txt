                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New AFib.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 10:33.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Given this, questionable right perihilar opacity is no longer appreciated and
 most likely related to vascular structures.  Blunting of the costophrenic
 angles suggest small pleural effusions.  There is likely left base
 atelectasis.  Slight prominence of the vasculature may be due to mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right perihilar opacity is no longer well seen and likely due to vascular
 structures.  Low lung volumes and likely trace bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Left base atelectasis.  Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
