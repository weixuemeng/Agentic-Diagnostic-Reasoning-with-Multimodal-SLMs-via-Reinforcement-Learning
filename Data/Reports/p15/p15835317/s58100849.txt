                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of feeling generally
 unwell.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.
 Bibasilar opacities are seen, in part relate to costochondral calcifications,
 although increased since the prior study and may be secondary to aspiration
 and/or infection.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may
 be due to a trace pleural effusion or pleural thickening.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Old posterolateral right seventh rib
 fracture is seen.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 Compression deformity of upper lumbar/lower thoracic vertebral body is again
 seen without significant interval change.
