                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with likely aspiration event.  Study requested
 for evaluation of interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___
 and prior chest CTA from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP erect chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate chronic cardiomegaly remains unchanged.  There is minimal
 pulmonary vascular congestion but no frank pulmonary edema. There are low lung
 volumes. There is heterogeneous opacity of the left lung base with worsening
 obliteration of the pleural surface. Pleural fluid at the left lung base
 remains unchanged. Note is made of multiple bilateral healed rib fractures. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Heterogeneous opacity at left lung base with worsening
 obliteration of the pleural surface, which could represent worsening
 atelectasis, aspiration or early developing pneumonia.  Close followup is
 recommended.
