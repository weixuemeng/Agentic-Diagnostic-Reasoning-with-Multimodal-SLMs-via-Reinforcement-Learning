                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the background of severe cardiomegaly, there are bilateral
 diffuse interstitial opacities, more pronounced in the mid and low lung fields
 with bilateral hilar engorgement. An area of more focal patchy/alveolar
 consolidation is seen in the right lower lobe.  There might be a small
 right-sided pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Sternotomy wires and surgical clips are redemonstrated.  No subdiaphragmatic
 free air is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with pulmonary edema. More focal area of
 alveolar consolidation in the right lower lobe raises concern for underlying
 pneumonia versus aspiration.
