 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear stable.  There is perihilar opacification and an
 indistinct appearance of pulmonary vessels with generalized prominence of the
 interstitium consistent with pulmonary edema.  There is mild-to-moderate
 reverse S-shaped curvature to the visualized thoracolumbar spine.  Surgical
 clips project over the upper abdomen.
