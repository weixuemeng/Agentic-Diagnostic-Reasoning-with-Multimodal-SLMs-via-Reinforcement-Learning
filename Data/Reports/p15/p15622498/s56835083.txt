                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, immunocompromised.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided pacemaker device with leads terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle is in unchanged position.  The heart remains mildly enlarged
 with dense mitral annular calcifications again seen.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged, with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta
 noted.  Lung volumes are low which causes crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures, and possible mild congestion but no overt pulmonary edema. 
 Minimal streaky opacity in the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Multiple
 clips are demonstrated within the upper abdomen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy right basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.
