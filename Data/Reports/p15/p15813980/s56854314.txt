                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Seizure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is borderline in size. Aside from dextropositioning, the mediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Incidental note is made of an
 azygos fissure which is consistent with a normal variant.  Mild biapical
 pleural thickening is consistent with minor scarring at each lung apex.  The
 lungs appear otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
