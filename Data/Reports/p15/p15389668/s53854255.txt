 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man undergoing evaluation for TAVR with leukocytosis

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No comparison.  The lung volumes are normal.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged, small bilateral pleural effusions are present but there is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  At the basis of the right lung, a zone of
 increased lung density is visualized, showing air bronchograms and likely
 reflecting pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Normal hilar and
 mediastinal contours.  Vascular stent in the left axillary region.
