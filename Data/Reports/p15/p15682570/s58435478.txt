                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax following PleurX placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is perhaps slight decrease in a moderate-sized pneumothorax
 and also increase in opacification of the right costophrenic sulcus that may
 reflect pleural fluid accumulation, atelectasis or both.  The left lung
 remains clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight decrease in pneumothorax.  Increasing right basilar
 opacification; otherwise unchanged.
