                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with increasing oxygen requirement, pleural
 effusion status post thoracentesis, question increase in effusion or pulmonary
 edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 904.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of right basilar pleural catheter with a stable small
 righ apicolateral and basilar pneumothorax.  There is a layering component of
 fluid at the right base consistent with a hydropneumothorax component which
 likely is not significantly changed given differences in patient positioning. 
 There is a smaller left effusion.  Patchy opacities at both bases likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis, although superimposed infectious process should
 also be considered.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Stable cardiac
 and mediastinal contours status post median sternotomy for CABG.  Left-sided
 pacer remains in place, unchanged.
