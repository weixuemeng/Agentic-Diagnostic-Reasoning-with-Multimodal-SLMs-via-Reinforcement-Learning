                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, here to evaluate for pneumonia or edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pectoral pacemaker is in place with two leads terminating in
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy with intact-appearing sternal wires.  Multiple mediastinal surgical
 clips are compatible with prior CABG surgery.  There is hazy opacification of
 the upper lungs and consolidation the lung bases.  No significant pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary vasculature is obscured. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size.  The mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits.  The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema more likely than pneumonia.
