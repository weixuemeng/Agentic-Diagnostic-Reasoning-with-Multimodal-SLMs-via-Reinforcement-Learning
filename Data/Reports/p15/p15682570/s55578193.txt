                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the rather extensive right
 pleural effusion, occupying approximately half of the right hemithorax, is
 unchanged in extent.  The pre-existing small left pleural effusion is
 completely resolved.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. 
 Unchanged wires and clips after CABG.  Unchanged course of the pacemaker
 wires.  A part of areas of atelectasis, resulting from the pleural effusion on
 the right, no changes are seen in the lung parenchyma.
