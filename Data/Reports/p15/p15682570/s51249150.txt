                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, chest pain.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 No previous films on PACS record for comparison.
 
 A left-sided pacemaker is in place, with lead tips over right atrium and right
 ventricle.  The patient is status post sternotomy, with mediastinal clips. 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  Note is made of a somewhat rounded configuration
 to the heart.  No mediastinal widening or apical capping is identified.  There
 is pulmonary vascular plethora as well as vascular blurring.  The right minor
 fissure is retracted superiorly, suggesting volume loss in the right upper
 lobe, though the mediastinum remains midline.  There is confluent opacity in
 the right base medially, though with preservation of the right heart border. 
 There is also increased retrocardiac density.  Minimal blunting of right and
 ?left costophrenic angles.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post sternotomy, with dual lead pacemaker.  Probable cardiomegaly. 
 Rounded configuration of the heart may represent normal variation, though
 raises the question of possible pericardial fluid.
 
 2.  Increased interstitial markings most likely reflect an element of CHF.
 
 3.  More confluent bibasilar opacities raise the question of associated
 pneumonic infiltrates.
 
 4.  Elevated minor fissure,  consistent with volume loss in the right upper
 lobe, of uncertain etiology.
 
 5.  Small right greater than left effusions.
