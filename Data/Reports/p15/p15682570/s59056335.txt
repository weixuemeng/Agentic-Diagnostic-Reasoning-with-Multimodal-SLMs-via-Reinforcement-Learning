                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute on chronic systolic CHF.  Question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 Allowing for differences in technique, the appearance is quite similar to the
 film from ___ at 23:57 p.m.  
 
 Again seen are diffuse bilateral alveolar and interstitial infiltrates,
 consistent with CHF and pulmonary edema.  Volume loss in the right upper lobe
 indicated by retraction of the minor fissure is again noted, similar to prior.
 The opacities appear less white on the current study, likely reflecting
 differences in technique.  Of note, no effusion is detected.  The extreme left
 costophrenic angle is excluded from the film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities, overall similar to
 prior, with unchanged volume loss in the right upper zone.  While, given the
 history,  this presumably reflects pulmonary edema, the lack of effusion
 raises the possibility of other causes of alveolar opacity, including
 infection/ARDS and, in the appropriate clinical setting, hemorrhage.  Clinical
 correlation requested.
