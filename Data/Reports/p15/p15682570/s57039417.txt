                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with Pleurx catheter,
 re-assessment.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 on ___ at 11:20 p.m.
 
 Since the prior study, there is a slight interval increase in the apical
 component of the pneumothorax and potentially mild accumulation of the fluid. 
 Right basal opacity appears to be minimally improved.  The heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged.
