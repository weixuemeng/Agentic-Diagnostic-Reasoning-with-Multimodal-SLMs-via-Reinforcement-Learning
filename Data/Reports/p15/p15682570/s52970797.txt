                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with Pleurx catheter,
 assessment of pneumothorax.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained the same day earlier at 5:58 p.m.
 
 Since the prior study, there is no substantial change in the basal and apical
 components of the pneumothorax, but the lateral component appears to be mildly
 increased with subsequent worsening of the right basal opacity.  The rest of
 the findings are unchanged.
