                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New sternal drainage.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is interval progression of right upper lobe consolidation highly
 concerning for pneumonia.  There are also bibasal consolidations concerning
 for infection as well.  Mediastinal contour is stable except for opacification
 of the right cardiac border that might be concerning for right middle lobe
 consolidation.  The left pleural effusion appears to be increased, but the
 right pleural effusion has slightly increased.  Apical pneumothorax is noted
 on the right and minimal amount of pneumothorax is suspected on the left.
 
 Of note is also that the two lower sternal wires appear to be slightly
 displaced to the right as compared to the immediate postoperative study and in
 constellation of the sternal drainage, attention to this area to exclude the
 possibility of developing osteomyelitis or infectious process is recommended.
