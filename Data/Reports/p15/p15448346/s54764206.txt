                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with coronary artery disease, presenting
 with chest pain and dyspnea on exertion.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema or
 focal infiltrate.  
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding AP and lateral chest examination of ___. 
 Status post sternotomy and bypass surgery, presence of left-sided permanent
 pacer with three intracavitary electrodes, two of which terminating in right
 atrial area and the third in right ventricular area. They all appear
 unchanged.  The pulmonary congestive pattern, mild degree of pulmonary
 vascular distention and prominent vasculature in upper pulmonary compartments
 (upper zone re-distribution pattern)also appear unchanged.  The pulmonary
 vasculature again appears crowded in the bases, apparently related to the
 relatively high-positioned diaphragms and poor inspirational effort.  There is
 no evidence of acute parenchymal infiltrates or signs of pleural effusion
 blunting the lateral pleural sinuses as can be identified on a single view
 chest examination.  No pneumothorax is seen in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no conclusive evidence for increasing
 pulmonary congestion.  Comparison with next previous study obtained on ___.  Question of increasing pleural effusion or basal infiltrates could be
 answered more definitely if a lateral chest view had been obtained.
