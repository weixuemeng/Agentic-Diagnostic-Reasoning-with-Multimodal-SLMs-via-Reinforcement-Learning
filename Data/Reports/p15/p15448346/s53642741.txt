 HISTORY:  Increasing dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___, ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes results in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.  The left
 pacemaker leads are in stable position.  Prosthetic aortic valve is again
 seen.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumonia, edema, or effusion.
