                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Frequent falls and weakness.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a left-sided
 dual-chamber pacer terminating in standard position.  There is a small area of
 hazy nodularity at the left lung base thought most likely to represent
 atelectasis.  Tortuous aorta and coronary artery stent are again visualized. 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac, hilar, and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar atelectasis. Otherwise, normal.
