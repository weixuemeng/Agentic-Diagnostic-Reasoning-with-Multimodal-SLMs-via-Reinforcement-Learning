                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is subtle right middle lobe opacity which may be due to atelectasis
 although an early infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  The left lung is clear.  The hilar contours are stable. 
 The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle right middle lobe opacity most likely represents atelectasis although
 an early infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
