 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left PICC terminates at the junction of the left brachiocephalic
 vein and superior vena cava.  Previously reported focal opacity in the left
 mid lung region has partially cleared and may reflect a slowly resolving
 pneumonia.  Lungs are otherwise clear except for linear atelectasis at the
 left lung base.
