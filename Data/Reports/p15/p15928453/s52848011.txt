                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with septic shock, status post new left-sided
 subclavian TLC.  Evaluate for central line placement.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___, 1:39.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left subclavian central venous catheter coils within the azygos
 vein.  There is no definite pneumothorax on the left.  There is a new linear
 oriented opacity in the lateral aspect of the right lung which is concerning
 for a pneumothorax. Given its linear appearance however, it may also represent
 a skinfold, additional evaluation is recommended with followup chest
 radiograph. Remaining monitoring and support devices are in unchanged
 position.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Again seen is an ill-defined area of increased opacity in the left mid zone,
 concerning for malignancy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian central venous catheter coils in the azygos vein. 
 Repositioning is recommended.
 
 2.  New linear oriented opacity in the right lung, potential pneumothorax
 versus skinfold.  Additional evaluation is recommended with followup chest
 radiograph.
 
 3.  Ill defined increased opacity in the left mid lung, concerning for
 malignancy. 
 
 These findings were discussed with ___ by ___ via
 telephone on ___ at 12 p.m., at time of discovery.
