                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears mildly enlarged, slightly increased from the prior study. 
 The aorta remains tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unchanged.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present along with small
 bilateral pleural effusions, increased from the previous study.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax
 is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased but mild cardiomegaly.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with
 small bilateral pleural effusions, increased from prior, and bibasilar patchy
 opacities, likely atelectasis.
