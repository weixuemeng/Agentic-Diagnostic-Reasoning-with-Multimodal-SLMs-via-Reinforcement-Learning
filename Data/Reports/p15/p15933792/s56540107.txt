                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, lethargy with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP supine portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 pulmonary interstitium has a mildly coarsened appearance including ___ B
 lines, particularly at the right lung base.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  This appearance includes a vague nodular opacity
 projecting over the right lower lung.  An area of developing pneumonia or
 atelectasis could be considered but a lung nodule is also a possibility to
 exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Coarse interstitial markings, suggestive of mild vascular
 congestion or fluid overload.  Airway inflammation could also contribute to
 coarse interstitial markings.  There is a possible nodular opacity projecting
 over the right lower lung.  Short-term followup radiographs are recommended,
 preferably with PA and lateral technique if possible, in order to see whether
 it may persist and needs further evaluation.
