                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new atrial fibrillation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is diffusely calcified.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated with scarring noted within the lung apices.  Streaky atelectasis
 is seen in both lung bases as well as more focal linear atelectasis noted in
 the region of the lingula as seen on the lateral view.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic angles could suggest small bilateral pleural effusions or chronic
 pleural thickening.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Osseous structures are diffusely
 demineralized with mild multilevel degenerative changes noted in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally may
 reflect trace bilateral pleural effusions versus chronic pleural thickening. 
 COPD.
