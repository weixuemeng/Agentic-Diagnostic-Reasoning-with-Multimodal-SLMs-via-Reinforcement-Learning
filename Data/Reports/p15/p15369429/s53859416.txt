                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with CHF and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial
 clearing of the pulmonary edema and possible right lower lobe pneumonia. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles is seen bilaterally, though there is no
 evidence of pleural effusion on the lateral view.
 
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Poor definition of the right
 heart border is somewhat similar to the appearance dating back to ___.  No
 opacification is seen overlying the cardiac silhouette on the lateral view,
 though a middle lobe process would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
 
 Of incidental note is extensive calcification involving virtually the entire
 visualized portion of the aorta.
