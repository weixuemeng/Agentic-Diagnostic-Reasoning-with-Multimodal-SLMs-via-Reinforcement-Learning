                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph obtained ___.  CT chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest are provided.  The right cardiac border
 is indistinct, which is partially due to epicardial fat pad, better seen on CT
 exam of ___.  There is no pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Prominent
 interstitial markings are more conspicuous since prior.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unchanged.  Aortic arch and intrathoracic aortic
 calcifications are noted.  Heart is top normal in size.  Perihilar vascular
 congestion is noted.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. 
 Degenerative changes of bilateral acromioclavicular joints are noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Prominent interstitial markings are more pronounced since prior, which may
 represent intersitial edema or underlying chronic intersitial disease.
