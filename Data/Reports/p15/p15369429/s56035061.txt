                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of COPD, now with crackles and cough
 for one week.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours
 demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease throughout the aortic arch. 
 Calcifications are also seen about the aortic valve.  A rounded density
 projecting over the expected region of the right atrium was compared to prior
 CT and reflects components of the right atrium and an epicardial fat pad.  The
 lungs demonstrate coarsened features with mild basilar atelectasis but no
 evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis, but no acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
