                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and edema.  Evaluate for CHF.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest CT, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph on ___, there has been new
 development of small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right than on
 the left.  There has been slight increase in the size of the cardiac
 silhouette and new pulmonary vascular engorgement and vascular indistinctness.
 There are bilateral  opacities at the bases, more confluent on the right than
 the left, likely representing asymmetric edema.  Given the asymmetry, would
 follow up with repeat x-ray after diuresis to rule out underlying pneumonia. 
 Again noted is stable calcification in the aortic arch.  The osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Likely asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Given asymmetry, consider follow up
 with repeat x-ray after diuresis to exclude an underlying pneumonia at right
 lung base.
 2.  Bilateral small pleural effusions.
