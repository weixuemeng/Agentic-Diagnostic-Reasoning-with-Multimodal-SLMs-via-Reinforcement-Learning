                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right rib pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  The hilar contours are unremarkable.  Patchy bibasilar
 airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No displaced fractures are identified.  If there
 is continued concern for rib fracture, then a dedicated rib series is
 recommended.
