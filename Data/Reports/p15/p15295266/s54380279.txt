                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Bandemia, suspected pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinum is unremarkable except for enlargement
 of the aortic arch.  Lungs are essentially clear except for most likely
 chronic linear opacities in the lung bases.  No focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia is demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Hyperinflation is most likely present.
