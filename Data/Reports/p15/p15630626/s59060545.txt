                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever, neutropenic  // ?pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Due to a severe pectus excavatum
 deformity, opacity in the right cardiophrenic recess is more likely reflective
 of epicardial fat.  No convincing evidence for pneumonia or CHF.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  Bony structures
 are intact.  Mediastinal contour is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute findings.  Opacity in the right cardiophrenic recess likely
 represents epicardial fat in the setting of a severe pectus excavatum
 deformity.  Mild cardiomegaly.
