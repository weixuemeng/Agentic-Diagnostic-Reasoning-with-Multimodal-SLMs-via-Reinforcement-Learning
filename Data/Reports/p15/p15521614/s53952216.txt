                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single semi-upright AP portable view and lateral view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Per the radiology technologist, patient unable to sit up straight, move his
 hands out of the way, bring his knees down, and raise his head.  Best images
 possible.
 
 The patient's chin overlies the lung apices, right greater than left.  The
 patient has a battery pack overlying the right mid chest, partially obscuring
 the view.  Leads extend into the neck.  There are multiple left-sided rib
 fractures which appear subacute to old.  Lung volumes are low.  No pleural
 effusion is seen.  There is no definite focal consolidation seen.  The aortic
 knob is calcified.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal study, as above including patient's chin overlies the
 right greater than left lung apices and battery pack overlying the right mid
 hemithorax, as well as patient positioning.  Given this, low lung volumes
 without definite focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion seen.  Multiple
 left-sided rib fractures which appear likely nonacute.
