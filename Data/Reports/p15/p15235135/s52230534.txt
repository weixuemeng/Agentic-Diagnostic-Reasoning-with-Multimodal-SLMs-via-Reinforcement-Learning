                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man found down, failed S+S needs dobhoff, altered so
 need staged approach // location of dobhoff placement with staged KUB for
 altered pt
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The newly placed Dobhoff tube tip is just to the left of midline in the mid to
 lower left hemithorax - its position is unclear and could be in the lung or
 esophagus. The stylet is still in the Dobhoff tube. No pneumothorax. Mild
 pulmonary edema is new from the prior exam. Increased opacity in the left
 lower lung and infrahilar region also suggests superimposed aspiration.
 Overall stable heart size. Prominent mediastinum is also overall unchanged and
 may be secondary to tortuous or ectatic thoracic aorta and pulmonary vascular
 fullness. No definite pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Malpositioned Dobhoff tube with tip projecting just lateral of midline over
 the left hemithorax - unclear if still in esophagus or in lung. Dobhoff should
 be pulled out and placement reattempted.
 2. Interval increase in pulmonary edema.
 3. Interval increased left lower lung and infrahilar opacity suggests also
 superimposed aspiration.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
