                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with poor swallow s/p dobhoff  // placement of
 dobhoff. Staged approach.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Initial image history foot placement of the duct cough tube.  Subsequent image
 cysts the double of tube ends study left with its tip projecting over the left
 mediastinum proximal to the gastroesophageal junction.  Yet another subsequent
 radiograph shows the Dobhoff tube tip in the approximate region of the GE
 junction or just slightly distal.  The final image shows the Dobhoff tube tip
 in the stomach just distal to the GE junction.
 
 Otherwise, no significant change.  Bibasilar atelectasis, greater on the left
 is slightly worse.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  No focal consolidation,
 pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is overall
 unchanged with prominence of the thoracic aorta.  No significant change in
 small left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Dobhoff tube and stylet in stomach just past GE junction.  Could advance a
 few more centimeters.
 2.  Otherwise, no significant interval change.
