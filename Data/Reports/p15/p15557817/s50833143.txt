                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea and hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  There is mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural
 effusions, larger on the left.  More focal opacity in the left lung base could
 reflect atelectasis, but pneumonia is not excluded.  No pneumothorax is
 present.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the
 left.  More focal left basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis but infection
 is not excluded.
