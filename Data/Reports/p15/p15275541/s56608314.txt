                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Substantial weight gain, dyspnea, suspected
 congestive heart failure.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  There is mild
 vascular engorgement/minimal interstitial pulmonary edema.  Bilateral rib
 fractures are noted with callus formation, thus at least subacute.  The
 patient is after replacement of the left humerus, most likely due to prior
 trauma.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion demonstrated.
 
 The lateral view reflects increase in density over the left lower spine. 
 These findings might reflect potentially infectious process and unlikely to
 represent pulmonary edema.  Repeated radiograph after diuresis is suggested.
