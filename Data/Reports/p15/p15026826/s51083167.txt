                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with syncope, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Reference radiograph from___ from 4 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained. Prominence of the
 right heart and mediastinum may reflect an enlarged aorta.  Increased
 interstitial opacity in the lungs may reflect chronic pulmonary disease
 without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Mild vascular
 congestion is seen, without overt edema.  Mid right clavicular fracture is
 seen without evidence of additional bony injury, though if specific symptoms,
 dedicated rib views may be of help.  Cardiac silhouette is top normal with a
 rounded retrocardiac opacity reflecting a moderate hiatal 
 hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION: Enlarged mediastinum in the setting of syncope could reflect
 aortic pathology such as dissection and evaluation by CTA is recommended. 
 
 This was discussed with ___ by Dr. ___ at ___ on ___ by
 phone.
