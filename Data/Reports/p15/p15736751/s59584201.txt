 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of heart failure, chest pain, evaluation for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 3:35 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of relatively low lung volumes and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette. 
 However, there is no evidence of overt pulmonary edema, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pneumonia that could explain the clinical presentation of the
 patient.  No safe evidence of rib lesions.
