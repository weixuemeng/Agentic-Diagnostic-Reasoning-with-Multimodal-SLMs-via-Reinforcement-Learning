                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness and fatigue.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___ as well as
 chest CTs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The hilar contour is stable. 
 The mediastinum is slightly widened with a tortuous aorta.  Again seen are
 reticular interstitial abnormalities more prominent at the lung bases
 consistent with known pulmonary fibrosis.  There is no focal consolidation,
 effusion or pneumothorax.  A surgical clip projects over the anterior
 mediastinum on lateral views.  No acute bony changes identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interstitial prominence compatible with history of pulmonary fibrosis.  No
 acute intrathoracic process.
