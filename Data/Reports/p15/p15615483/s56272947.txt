                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATIONS:  Please assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed in comparison with prior
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is present; however, there is
 no frank pulmonary edema.  There is an ill-defined opacity in the right
 paracardiac region with indistinct right heart margin which may represent
 atelectasis or aspiration or pneumonia.Its significance should be interpreted
 along with clinical history.  Right-sided pleural effusion is small.  Heart
 size is top normal and unchanged since ___.  Old healed rib fractures
 are present bilaterally.  T8, T12 and the L2 vertebral bodies demonstrated
 wedge compression fracture, most severely affecting the T12 and L1 vertebrae. 
 In addition, the T12 and L2 vertebrae show increased density. These vertebral
 changes are new since ___.  In view of multiple vertebral collapse and
 diffuse osteopenia, possibility of metastatic disease cannot be ruled out.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right lower medial lung opacity could be atelectasis/aspiration or
 pneumonia; further clinical correlation is needed.  
 2.  Small right pleural effusion is small.
 2.  Diffuse osteopenia and wedge compression fracture of T8, T12 and L2
 vertebrae is new since ___. Possibility of metastatic disease cannot be
 ruled out.
 
 Dr. ___ discussed the findings with Dr. ___ by phone
 on ___, at 3:23 p.m.
