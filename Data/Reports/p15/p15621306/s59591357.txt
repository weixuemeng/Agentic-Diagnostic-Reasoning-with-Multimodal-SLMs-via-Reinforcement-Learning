  No pneumothorax or change in cardiac silhouette.  Trace left pleural effusion.
  There is a heterogenous opacity within the left lower lobe appreciated more on
  the lateral view.  This may represent atelectasis but the possibility of
  pneumonia could be entertained in the appropriate clinical setting.  The lungs
  are otherwise clear.  The catheter tip of the right chest wall port terminates
  in the low SVC as before.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is slightly improved

 opacity at the bases of the left lung is now seen on the lateral radiograph
 only.  No new parenchymal opacities.  Unchanged size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Right pectoral Port-A-Cath is unchanged.  Unchanged mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
