                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:27 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recurrent fever, possible pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes have improved, but I think that mild cardiomegaly and previous
 mild pulmonary edema have also decreased.  There are no focal abnormalities to
 suggest pneumonia.  A right subclavian infusion port ends in the low SVC. 
 Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified and tortuous but not focally dilated.
