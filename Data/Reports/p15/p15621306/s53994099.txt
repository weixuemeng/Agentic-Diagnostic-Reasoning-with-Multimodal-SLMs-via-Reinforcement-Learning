 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Fever.
 
 Comparison is made with the prior study ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with tortuous aorta.  There is no
 evidence of pneumonia, CHF, pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Bilateral
 bronchiectasis larger on the left are probably unchanged.  Right central
 catheter tip is in the lower SVC.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Mild degenerative changes are in the thoracic spine.
