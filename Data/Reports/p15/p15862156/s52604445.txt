                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are relatively low.  With this factor in mind,
 cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without change. 
 Pleural and parenchymal scarring with associated volume loss is present in the
 right hemithorax, consistent with previous history of partial resection of the
 right lung, presumably prior right lower lobe resection.  No focal areas of
 consolidation are present, and there are no pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Postoperative scarring and volume loss following partial resection of the
 right lung.
