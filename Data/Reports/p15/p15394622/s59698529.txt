                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with syncope.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs are
 clear, but the previously described nodular density in the right lower lung is
 not well appreciated on the current exam.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process; nonvisualization of previously
 described right lower lung nodular density, but this may be due to differences
 in patient potion.
