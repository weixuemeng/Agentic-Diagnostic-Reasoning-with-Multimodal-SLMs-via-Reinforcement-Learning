                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year-old female with respiratory insufficiency requiring
 intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST:
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube is difficult to identify due to overlap with
 orogastric tube. Orogastric tube extends to the stomach, and a right PICC to
 the mid SVC.  Surgical clips are identified in the right axilla.  Hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Small bilateral effusions persist,
 and there is mild vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema.  No
 definite new opacity to suggest pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little change from one day prior.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions and mild vascular congestion persist.
