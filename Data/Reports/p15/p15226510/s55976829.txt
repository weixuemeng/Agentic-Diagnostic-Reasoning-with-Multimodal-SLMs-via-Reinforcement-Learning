                                 FINAL REPORT
 SUPINE CHEST, ___ AT ___ HOURS.
 
 HISTORY:  Facial fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier same night.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is markedly rotated, limiting the study.  An
 endotracheal tube has been inserted in the interval and is situated 3.7 cm
 from the carina in satisfactory placement.  A presumed orogastric tube has
 also been placed with the distal tip projecting at the GE junction and the
 sidehole presumably within the distal esophagus.  The study is grossly stable.
 Again, no displaced fractures are evident.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study due to rotation.  Support tubes have been placed in
 the interval.  The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position.  The
 nasogastric tube needs to be advanced 15 cm.
