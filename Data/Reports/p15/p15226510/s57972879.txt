 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): ___ ___ ___ 1:35 PM
  Persistent loss of airspace at the bilateral lung bases raises concern for
  pneumonia.  Less likely, this could represent continued pleural effusions and
  associated atelectasis, without an underlying infectious process.
  
 PFI VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 12:57 PM
  PFI:
  1.  Persistent loss of airspace at the bilateral lung bases raises concern for
  pneumonia.  Less likely, this could represent continued pleural effusions and
  associated atelectasis.
  2.  Persistent small left pleural effusion and increasing right pleural
  effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Ventilator-associated pneumonia, evaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ dating back to
 ___.
 
 PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  There is a hazy opacity at the right lung
 base obscuring the right hemidiaphragm.  The left lung base continues to be
 completely opacified and is largely unchanged from ___.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right PICC are
 in appropriate position and unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  The mild
 cardiomegaly is stable.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Persistent loss of airspace at the bilateral lung bases raises concern for
 pneumonia.  Less likely, this could represent continued pleural effusions and
 associated atelectasis, without an underlying infectious process.
