                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough*** WARNING *** Multiple patients with
 same last name!  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes which cause vascular crowding.  There is persistent
 mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is right basilar atelectasis
 without definite focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is subtle
 leftward deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet which is nonspecific,
 but can be seen in the setting of an enlarged right lobe of the thyroid.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with vascular crowding and possible right base atelectasis. 
 No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
 
   Subtle leftward deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet is
 nonspecific, but can be seen in the setting of an enlarged right lobe of the
 thyroid.  Consider non urgent, outpatient thyroid ultrasound.
