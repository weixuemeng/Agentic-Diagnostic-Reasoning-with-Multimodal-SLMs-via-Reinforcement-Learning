                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with wesaknes and fever  // pna? chf
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two portable views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Exam is slightly limited secondary to patient positioning and low lung
 volumes.  Streaky right basilar opacity is most likely atelectasis.  The lungs
 are otherwise grossly clear.  There is no overt edema.  There is moderate
 cardiac enlargement likely accentuated by technique and positioning.  Median
 sternotomy wires are intact.  Degenerative changes are noted at the left
 shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable right basilar atelectasis.  Cardiomegaly without definite
 superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.
