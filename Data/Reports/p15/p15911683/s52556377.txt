 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval change in position of left pigtail pleural catheter in the
 lower left hemithorax, with persistent moderate-sized left pleural effusion
 and no visible pneumothorax.  Adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation in
 left lower lobe and lingula appears similar.  Previously present mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion has resolved.  Small right pleural effusion is
 unchanged.
