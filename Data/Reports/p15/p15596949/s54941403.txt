                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with stroke.  Possible seizure.  Check NG tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Nasogastric tube passes to the mid stomach.  Lungs are fully expanded and
 clear.  Mild cardiomegaly has progressed.  A previous left lower lobe collapse
 has resolved.  Lateral view shows small pleural effusion, at least on one
 side, new or newly apparent since the prior studies.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged and there is no pleural effusion.  9 mm nodular opacity
 projecting over the right sixth rib anteriorly could be the right nipple
 because its configuration was different on chest radiograph, ___, when it
 projected over the right fifth anterior interspace.  In a younger patient,
 this would warrant shallow oblique views with nipple markers.  I am not sure
 that additional imaging is warranted in a ___-year-old patient with a history
 of stroke.
 
 Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified at the knob and mildly tortuous but not
 aneurysmal.
