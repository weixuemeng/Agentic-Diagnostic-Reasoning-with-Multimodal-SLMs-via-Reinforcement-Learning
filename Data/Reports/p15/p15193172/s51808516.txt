                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with CHF and near complete heart block. 
 Evaluate for evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___. CT chest
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There are no significant interstitial
 opacities to suggest pulmonary edema.  Aside from atelectasis due to chronic
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, lungs are clear. There is stable widening
 of the vascular pedicle secondary to an unfolded aorta, better seen in chest
 CT from ___.  The heart is mildly enlarged, with significant
 contribution from the left atrium.   The stomach is chronically over distended
 and gas filled.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No significant change from baseline radiograph, with elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm and a distended gas-filled stomach which raises the patient's
 risk for aspiration.
 
 2.  Unfolded aorta and mild cardiomegaly are unchanged from prior.
