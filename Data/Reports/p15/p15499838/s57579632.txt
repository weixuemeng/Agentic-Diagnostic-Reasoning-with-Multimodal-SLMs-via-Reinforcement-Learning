                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F PMH HTN, CKD, DVT p/w 1d h/o of weakness, audible congestion
 and rhonchi b/l on exam  // eval for PNM, pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  An IVC filter is again
 seen at the cavoatrial junction.  Previously noted PICC line has been removed.
 Subtle retrocardiac opacity may represent a very early pneumonia. Otherwise
 the lungs appear clear. Coarsened lung markings suggest underlying
 interstitial lung disease. No large effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is
 normal. Mediastinal contours unremarkable. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity in the left lower lobe is concerning for pneumonia. Probable
 underlying interstitial lung disease.
