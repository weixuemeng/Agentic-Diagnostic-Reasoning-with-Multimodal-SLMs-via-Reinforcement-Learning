                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Malaise and nausea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is again
 patchy density projecting over the left upper lung suggesting a mild chronic
 abnormality. The lungs appear otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The bones are probably demineralized.  Mild loss in height
 among several thoracolumbar vertebral bodies is probably unchanged. An
 inferior vena cava filter again projects at the level of the uppermost
 inferior vena cava, not significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
