                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with new onset hypoxia and cough, evaluate for
 pneumonia or fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, wiuth evidence of cardiomegaly.  There
 is diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities with peribronchial cuffing, which
 could reflecting mild pulmonary edema.  There is no focal consolidation. 
 Subtle nodular opacities in the left upper zone were better seen on the
 ___ CXR. There are small pleural effusions collecting in the posterior
 sulci.  High position of the IVC filter with tip in the right atrium is again
 noted. AT th einfeiror edge of the film, a looped catheter projects over the
 right upper quadrant, not fully evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased diffuse pulmonary interstitial opacities and peribronchial
 cuffing. In the appropriate clinical setting, this would be consistent with
 mild pulmonary edema. 
 2.  Small posterior pleural effusions.
 3.  IVC filter positioned high, but unchanged.
