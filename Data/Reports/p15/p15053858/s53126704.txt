                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD.  Evaluate for acute pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP frontal and lateral chest radiographs are obtained.  Lungs are
 symmetric and well-expanded bilaterally. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged from the prior examination.  Linear retrocardiac opacities are
 unchanged and likely represent scarring. Slightly more prominent streaky right
 lower lobe opacities could represent atelectasis; however, consolidation
 cannot be excluded. Mild prominence of central vasculature is unchanged. No
 large pleural effusion and no pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 Slightly more prominent streaky right lower lobe densities likely represent
 atelectasis, but consolidation is not entirely excluded.
