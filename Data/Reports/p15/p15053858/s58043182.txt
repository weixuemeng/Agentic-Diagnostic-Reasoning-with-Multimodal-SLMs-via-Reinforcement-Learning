                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD, with fever, chills and cough. On
 antibiotics but not improving.  // any evidence of pneumonia     any evidence
 of pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT scans and conventional radiographs since ___ and
 ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously demonstrated slowly progressive region of peribronchial
 consolidation in the right lower lobe best appreciated on the chest CT ___ may be more pronounced on today's study.  I doubt that this is
 acute pneumonia, although it could be a site of chronic bronchiectasis and
 retained secretions.  Elsewhere the lungs are clear.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 and upper lobe pulmonary vascular redistribution are chronic but there is no
 edema or pleural effusion.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT scanning may be necessary to see if there is a
 component of acute consolidation or, alternatively, worsening bronchiectasis,
 in the region of previously demonstrated peribronchial infiltration in the
 right lower lobe.
