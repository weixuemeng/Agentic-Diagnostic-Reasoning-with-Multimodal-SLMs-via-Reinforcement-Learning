                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with esophageal tear with the patient on G tube, now with
 bile preparation of colonoscopy, status post ex lap sigmoid colectomy and
 colostomy.  For evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Current radiograph is dated ___, timed at 5:54 a.m.
 
 REPORT:
 
 A right-sided subclavian line lies in unchanged position.  The ET tube lies
 pretty close to the carina and should be retracted 3-4 cm.  It is in overall
 relatively unchanged position; however, from prior study.  There is
 tracheobronchial and aortic calcification.  Again identified are low lung
 volumes.  There are some bibasilar pleural effusions with worsening
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  The left-sided pleural reaction appears to have
 lessened somewhat, however.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Probably worsening pulmonary edema.  The ET tube is hovering just
 above the carina and should be retracted 2 cm.  This was telephoned to and
 discussed with ___ at the time of reporting.
