                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with perforated bowel after
 surgery.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The patient was extubated.  The right internal jugular line tip is at the mid
 SVC.  Mild vascular engorgement is demonstrated that might be consistent with
 termination of mechanical ventilation.  Bibasilar opacities are most likely a
 combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.
