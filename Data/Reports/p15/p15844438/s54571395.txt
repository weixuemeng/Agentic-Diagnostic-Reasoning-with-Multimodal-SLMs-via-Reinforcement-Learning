                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post colectomy, now with pneumonia and
 pleural effusion.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:  The endotracheal tube tip sits 2 cm above the carina. 
 The right-sided central line tip sits in the mid SVC.  The heart size is at
 the upper limits of normal with calcified atherosclerotic disease at the
 aortic knob.  S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracic spine is present.  Moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions exist with underlying consolidation, likely
 atelectasis, although superinfection cannot be excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The extent of pulmonary effusions and consolidations are
 similar to prior exam.
