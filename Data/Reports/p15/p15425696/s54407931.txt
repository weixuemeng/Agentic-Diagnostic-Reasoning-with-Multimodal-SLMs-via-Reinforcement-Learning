                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure, atelectasis  // please
 assess for interval change      please assess for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Again there is extensive opacification in both lower lung zones, consistent
 with layering pleural effusions and underlying atelectasis.  Cardiac
 silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal in size and it is somewhat
 difficult to assess the pulmonary vascularity in view of the prominent
 effusions.
 Monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
