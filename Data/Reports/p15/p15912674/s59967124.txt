                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with with chest pain status post compressions. 
 Evaluate for fracture.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Same-day CT torso.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Heterogeneous opacification of
 the left lung is consistent with a combination of pleural fluid and
 consolidation/atelectasis, presumably related to multiple fractures left
 middle ribs laterally.  The pulmonary vasculature is diffusely indistinct,
 consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  The heart is
 moderately enlarged and the vascular pedicle is widened necessitating CT
 evaluation.  A few left rib fractures are minimally displaced.  Sternotomy
 wires are intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Multiple left rib fractures, associated hemothorax and pulmonary
 atelectasis or contusion. See progression on Torso CT performed 2 hours after
 CXR, reported separately.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema.
