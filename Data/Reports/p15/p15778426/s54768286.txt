                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with CT findings suggesting ___ infection. 
 Possible COP or vasculitis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest read in conjunction with chest CT, ___:
 
 Large cluster of opacities in the left upper lobe conforms to largest left
 upper lobe lesion on the ___ chest CT.  It is hard to say whether the
 lesion is larger, but though there are other findings ___ ___ infection on the
 CT scan, this lesion is probably not one of them.  Of note are COPD, and
 severe calcific aortic stenosis, although there is no pulmonary vascular
 engorgement, edema or even pleural effusion, and the most prominently enlarged
 cardiac chamber is the left atrium.  Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified but
 not focally aneurysmal.  Pulmonary artery enlargement is sufficient to raise
 diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic finding along with the
 other cardiovascular issues.
