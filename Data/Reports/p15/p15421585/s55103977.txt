                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Fever.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographdemonstrates hypoinflated lungs with
 crowding of vasculature.  A heterogeneous right lower lobe opacity is noted. 
 Subtle blunting of the right costophrenic angle is consistent with a new small
 right pleural effusion.  No left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.  A right porta
 cath tip is deep in the right atrium, unchanged since previous examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Heterogeneous right lower lobe opacity is most consistent with atelectasis
 2.  New small right pleural effusion.
 3.  Right porta cath tip deep in right atrium, unchanged since ___.
