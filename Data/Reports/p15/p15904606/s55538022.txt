                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated.

 hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 Lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Remote left-sided rib fractures are re-
 demonstrated. Calcifications adjacent to the superior and lateral aspects of
 both humeral heads likely reflect calcific tendinitis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
