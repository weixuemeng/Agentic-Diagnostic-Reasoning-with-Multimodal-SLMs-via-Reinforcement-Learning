                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fatigue.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 on the frontal view which does not persist on the lateral view, most likely
 due to overlying soft tissue.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly
 enlarged.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Multiple compression deformities are
 again seen along the spine; some in the upper lumbar spine may have increased
 since the prior study, although are not well assessed on this study.
