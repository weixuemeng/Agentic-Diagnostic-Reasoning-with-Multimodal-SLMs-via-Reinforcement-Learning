 infection.  Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  Both lungs show no evidence of pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  A subtle double density noted anteriorly on the lateral
 view with no definite correlate on the frontal view may represent early
 pneumonia. There is prominence of bronchovascular markings. Bony structures
 are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
