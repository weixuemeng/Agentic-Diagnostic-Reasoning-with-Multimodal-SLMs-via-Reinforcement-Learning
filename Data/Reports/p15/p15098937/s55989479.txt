                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and productive cough.
 
 COMPARISONS: None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  Mild prominence of the main pulmonary
 artery contour is probably a normal variant.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Vague opacities in the left lower lobe, and an anterior opacity
 seen on the lateral view more likely in the right middle lobe, suggest
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting pneumonia.
