  Nodular opacities, potentially calcified in the right mid lung laterally,
  potentially granulomas however correlation with older exams is suggested to
  confirm stability should they become aailable.  Otherwise, nonurgent CT scan
  suggested to exclude underlying lesion.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male, suicidal and leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  There are few relatively nodular opacities
 in the right mid lung laterally which are relatively dense, potentially
 calcified and may represent calcified granulomas.  The lungs are clear of
 focal consolidation or effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Nodular opacities, potentially calcified in the right mid lung laterally,
 potentially granulomas however correlation with older exams is suggested to
 confirm stability.  Otherwise, nonurgent CT scan suggested to exclude
 underlying lesion.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
