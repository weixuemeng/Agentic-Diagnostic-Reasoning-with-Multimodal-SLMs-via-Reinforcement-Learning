                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Question endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates in the upper trachea about 6.5 cm above the
 carina.  An orogastric tube courses into the stomach.  Its sidehole marker
 projects over the expected site of the gastroesophageal junction.  The lungs
 appear clear.  There no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post endotracheal intubation.  Sidehole marker of orogastric tube
 projecting at the gastroesophageal junction.  If clinically indicated,
 advancing the tube somewhat may be appropriate.  No evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary disease.
