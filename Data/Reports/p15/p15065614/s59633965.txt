                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hx of R pleural effus and breast ca and port
 pls eval port placement as well as effus  // History: ___F with hx of R pleural
 effus and breast ca and port pls eval port placement as well as effus
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large opacity projecting over the right mid to lower lung is worrisome for
 large pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation or
 pulmonary in mass may be present.  There are increased interstitial markings
 bilaterally, underlying metastatic disease is not excluded.  No large left
 pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath
 is seen, distal aspect not well seen due to the right lung opacity.  The right
 aspect of the cardiac silhouette is obscured by the right sided opacity. 
 Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable.  Surgical clips are noted
 overlying the right hemi thorax.  Sclerotic heterogeneous the osseous
 structures including the spine and sternum are worrisome for metastatic
 disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large area of opacity projecting over the right mid to lower lung is
 concerning for large pleural effusion, underlying consolidation for pulmonary
 mass not excluded.  Increased interstitial markings bilaterally, pulmonary
 metastatic disease not excluded.
 
 Heterogeneity to the osseous structures including the spine concerning for
 metastases.
