 INDICATION:  History of seizures, fall.  Rule out aspiration pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina.  There
 is an enteric tube which traverses below the diaphragm with the tip likely in
 the body of the stomach.  There has been interval improvement of the
 multifocal regions of consolidation in the lungs, predominantly at the bases
 with residual left lower lobe consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears to be stable.  There is new opacity overlying the left lower lung with
 silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm concerning for left lower lobe
 collapse. There is no large pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 visualized osseous structures demonstrate an old healed left rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. New opacity at the left lung base silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm,
 concerning for left lower lobe collapse.
 
 2. Slight improvement of the remainder areas of consolidation, with a residual
 area of consolidation at the right lower lobe.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by telephone at
