 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac silhouette size is borderline enlarged. 
 Widening of the superior mediastinal contours due to the presence of
 mediastinal fat.  Hilar contours are normal.  Crowding of bronchovascular
 structures is present without pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Known fractures of the
 right-sided ribs are better assessed on the same day CT.
