                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute abdominal pain, altered mental status and history of strokes. 
 Evaluation for free air or worsening pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval removal of a
 right-sided Port-A-Cath and improvement in left pleural effusion and pleural
 fluid along the right horizontal fissure on the right. A hazy opacity projects
 over the peripheral left mid lung zone, which is likely due to post radiation
 changes.  The heart size is stable and the lung volumes are persistently low,
 with bibasilar atelectasis.  The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion is
 slightly improved since the prior study.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax
 or subdiaphragmatic free air on this portable study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Hazy opacity in the peripheral left mid lung zone, which is likely due to
 post radiation changes.
 2. Interval improvement in pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions
 since the prior study.
