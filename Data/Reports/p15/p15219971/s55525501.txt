                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower.  With new
 increased interstitial markings at the bilateral bases, this may represent new
 interstitial lung disease.  There is no focal consolidation.  There is no
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung volumes and basilar interstitial opacities may
 represent new interstitial lung disease.  Recommend further characterization
 with a high-resolution chest CT.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 4:30 PM on ___ via telephone
 by Dr. ___ ___ minutes after the findings were discovered.
