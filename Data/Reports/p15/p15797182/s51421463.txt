 Lung volumes are low accentuating the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary
 vasculature.  Endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm cranial to the carina.  Heart
 size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Bibasilar atelectasis is not worse on the left than the right. 
 Pleural surfaces are clear without large effusion or pneumothorax.
