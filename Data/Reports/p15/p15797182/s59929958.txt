 of OGT
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 New opacification in the left lower lobe is accompanied by some leftward
 mediastinal shift suggesting worsening left lower lobe atelectasis.  A milder
 degree of right basal atelectasis is still present.  Heart is at least
 moderately enlarged.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Poor definition of the airway in the left lung suggests
 retained secretions, an explanation for atelectasis.

 time a wet reading was placed.  ET tube is in standard placement.
