                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right lower lobe infiltrate and worsening symptoms despite five
 days of oral antibiotics.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is normal. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Consolidative opacities within the lingula as
 well as within the right upper lobe are concerning for multifocal pneumonia. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Biapical pleural scarring is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Consolidative opacities in the lingula and right upper lobe are
 concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Followup radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of
 this finding.
