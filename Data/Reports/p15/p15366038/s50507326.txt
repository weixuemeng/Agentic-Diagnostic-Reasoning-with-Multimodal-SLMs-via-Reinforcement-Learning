                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and shortness of breath.  Pneumonia
 versus CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There is diffuse increased interstitial marking seen
 throughout the lungs.  There is however no confluent consolidation nor
 effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but not significantly changed
 from prior given differences in technique.  Osseous and soft tissue structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffusely increased interstitial markings seen throughout the
 lungs.  This can be seen in the setting of mild interstitial edema versus
 chronic underlying lung disease.  Clinical correlation suggested.
