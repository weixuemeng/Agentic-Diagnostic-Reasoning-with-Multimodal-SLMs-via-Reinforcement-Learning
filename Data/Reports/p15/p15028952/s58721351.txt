                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest, supine portable.
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient status post cardiac
 arrest with respiratory failure on ventilator.
 
 COMPARISON:  A series of chest radiographs, most recently from ___ at
 22:09.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse airspace opacities, left worse than right, have minimally improved in
 the right lung.  The heart size is normal.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC,
 unchanged.  The endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the carina.  An
 orogastric tube passes through the esophagus, into the stomach, and inferiorly
 out of the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent bilateral airspace opacities, minimally improved in the right lung.
 Again, this could be secondary to infection, asymmetric cardiogenic pulmonary
 edema, or noncardiogenic edema such as ARDS.
