                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___M with hypoxia s/p fall with scapula fx, eval for PNA, pleural effusions,
 PTX, rib fractures      .
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest CT from same day.
 TECHNIQUE
 Portable upright view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Known left scapular and lower left rib fractures, better evaluated on the
 outside hospital chest CT.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  A more opacity
 confluent opacity at the left lung base, may be secondary to aspiration in the
 setting of trauma.  There is no pneumothorax.  Surgical clips are noted in the
 right upper quadrant.  Rounded opacity adjacent to right hemidiaphragm contour
 may correspond to diaphragmatic eventration, and correlation with CT findings
 is suggested.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumothorax. Known fractures better seen on CT from same day.
 Bibasilar atelectasis with a more confluent opacity in the left lower lobe,
 which may represent aspiration or contusion in the setting of trauma.
