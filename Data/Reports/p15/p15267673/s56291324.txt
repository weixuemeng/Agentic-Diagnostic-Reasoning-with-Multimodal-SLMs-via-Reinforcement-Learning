                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with two months of cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 A roughly 13 mm wide oval opacity projecting over the right fourth anterior
 interspace could be in the lung or soft tissue.  A 21 mm ring shadow
 projecting to the left of the cardiac silhouette could be due to
 superimposition of normal vessels, rather than a cavity.  Lungs are mildly
 hyperinflated suggesting small airway obstruction or emphysema, though I see
 no bullae.  There is no consolidation or pulmonary vascular abnormality, no
 edema or pleural effusion and the heart size is normal.  I recommend repeat
 chest radiographs in four weeks, supplemented by shallow oblique views to see
 if the questioned abnormalities have resolved, but if they are still present
 to see if they are real or artifactual.
