                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD exacerbation on BIPAP  // Interval
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, read in conjunction with chest
 CTA same day.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is larger today than on ___.  Right
 lower lobe is still collapsed, accounting for persistent rightward mediastinal
 shift. CT scan showed considerable central adenopathy and severe narrowing of
 the bronchus intermedius. Left lung is clear aside from retained aspirated
 barium demonstrating a grossly normal bronchial tree.
 
 Stigmata of remote trauma to the chest cage include healed left rib fractures
 and spinal stabilization hardware. I do not see evidence of COPD on the chest
 CTA, but the retained barium and air were suggests problems with aspiration.
