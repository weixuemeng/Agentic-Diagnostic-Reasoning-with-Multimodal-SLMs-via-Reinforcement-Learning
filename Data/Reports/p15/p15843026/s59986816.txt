 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:59 PM
  Increased interstitial markings and thickened interlobular septa, compatible
  with mild pulmonary edema.  Heart size is difficult to asses given rotation to
  the right and AP projection. No PTX.  Probable atelectasis in left lower lung,
  though an infectious process cannot be excluded. D/w ___ (___)
  at 7:58 p.m..

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with metastatic endometrial cancer.  Now
 sudden onset of acute hypoxia to 80s.  Evaluation for infiltrate or
 consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior radiographs are available for comparison.  This study is
 read in conjunction with CTA of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates the patient is rotated
 to the right.  There are increased interstitial markings and central pulmonary
 vascular congestion, consistent with pulmonary edema.  A right-sided
 Port-A-Cath is seen in standard position, terminating in the low SVC.  There
 is some bibasilar atelectasis with possible small bilateral pleural effusions.
 There is no pneumothorax or area of focal consolidation.  Heart size is
 difficult to assess given the patient is rotated to the right and AP
 projection of this portable radiograph, however, it is likely top normal in
 size.  A nipple shadow is seen projecting just above the left hemidiaphragm.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Bilateral pulmonary edema with bibasilar atelectasis and possible
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax or focal consolidation.
 
 A wet read was entered into the ___ and findings were discussed with Dr.
 ___ of neurology by Dr. ___ at 7:58 p.m. on ___.
