                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman who was acutely hypoxic last evening, now
 resolved.  Right upper lobe consolidation seen on CTA.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary edema has cleared, including asymmetric edema in the right lung
 apex.  There are no findings to suggest pneumonia.  Heart size normal.  No
 appreciable pleural effusion.  Persistent distention of the azygos vein
 suggests continued elevation of central venous pressure.  Although the frontal
 view is not marked, the accompanying lateral view was obtained with the
 patient sitting or standing nearly erect.  It shows air and fluid levels in
 distended loops of bowel throughout the upper abdomen.  The definition of both
 the inside and outside of the walls of distended intestinal loops is due to
 their apposition with one another, not pneumoperitoneum, since no free air is
 seen beneath either hemidiaphragm.  Lateral view shows small bilateral pleural
 effusions, presumably residual from the episode of heart failure.
