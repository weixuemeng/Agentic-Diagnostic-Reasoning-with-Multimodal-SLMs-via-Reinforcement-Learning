                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure s/p intubation  //
 evaluate interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16 at 06:07
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Extreme left lung base the left costophrenic angle excluded from the film.
 
 Again seen is an ET tube, with tip approximately 3.7 cm above the carina.  An
 NG tube is present -- although poorly delineated in the lower mediastinum, it
 likely extends beneath the diaphragm stop, similar to prior.  Additional wires
 and leads overlie the chest.
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse
 vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  There more confluent opacities at
 left-greater-than-right lung bases, similar to prior.  Probable left effusion,
 though this is not well visualized due to positioning of the film edge. 
 Extreme right costophrenic angle excluded from the film, but no gross right
 effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly.  CHF findings are probably slightly worse compared with 1 day
 earlier.  Bibasilar opacities are similar to prior.  Persistent left effusion.
