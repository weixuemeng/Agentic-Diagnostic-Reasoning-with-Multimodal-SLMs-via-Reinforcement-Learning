                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new tachycardia after IV fluids  // Evaluate
 for pulmonary edema      Evaluate for pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
 Despite persistent mild pulmonary edema, lung volumes are hyperinflated
 suggesting a component of small airway obstruction.  This is sometimes due to
 pulmonary edema, known as cardiac asthma.
 
 Increase bulk to the upper pole of the right hilus could be due to
 superimposition of a small region of consolidation or mass in the superior
 segment of the right lower lobe suggested by the ___ chest radiograph.
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Pleural effusion is small if any.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional chest radiographs following resolution of
 acute cardiac decompensation, to see if a chest CT is necessary in order to
 evaluate possible right lower lobe lung lesion.
