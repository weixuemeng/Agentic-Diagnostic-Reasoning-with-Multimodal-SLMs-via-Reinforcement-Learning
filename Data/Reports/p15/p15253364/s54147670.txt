                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall with right leg deformity.  Assess for signs of trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior study available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates severe S-shaped
 thoracolumbar scoliosis with a tortuous aorta.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Lungs are somewhat hyperexpanded with
 evidence of chronic changes in the lung apices, left greater than right. 
 Otherwise, lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. 
 No fractures identified including no displaced rib fractures.  Bones are
 severely osteopenic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No fracture is identified.
