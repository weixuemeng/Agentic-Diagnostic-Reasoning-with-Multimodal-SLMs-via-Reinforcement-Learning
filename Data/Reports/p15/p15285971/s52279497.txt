                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild right infrahilar opacity which appears new since the
 prior study and likely reflects atelectasis although infection cannot be
 completely excluded.  The remaining lung fields are clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours and pleural surfaces are normal. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal right infrahilar opacity is most likely atelectasis
 although infection is not completely excluded in the right clinical setting.
