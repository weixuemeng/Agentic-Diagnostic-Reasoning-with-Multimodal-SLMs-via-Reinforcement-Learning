                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  End-stage dementia status post syncope. Rule out pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Bedside frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are exceedingly low, resulting in crowding of bronchovascular
 structures. This also distorts the contours of the cardiomediastinum. There is
 no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without an acute cardiopulmonary process.
