                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with syncopal fall today // eval pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate diffuse bilateral
 interstitial lung markings likely reflective of mild pulmonary edema.
 Obscuration of the right heart border likely reflects atelectatic changes,
 although early consolidation cannot be excluded. Elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm is noted with atelectatic changes at the left lung base. No
 large pleural effusion is identified. Patient is status post median
 sternotomy. Prominence of the mediastinum likely reflects dilated or tortuous
 aorta.  Large gastric air bubble is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and atelectatic changes. Obscuration of the right heart
 border maybe due to atelectasis, though early pneumonia cannot entirely be
 excluded.
