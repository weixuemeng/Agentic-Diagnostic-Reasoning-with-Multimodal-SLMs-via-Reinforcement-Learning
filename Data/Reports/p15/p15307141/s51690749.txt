 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly is
 moderate, as on prior. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Patchy density at the right base may
 represent scarring or atelectasis.  Left perihilar density likely is a
 vascular structure.

 No acute intrathoracic process.  Left perihilar density likely is a vascular
 structure, but appears more prominent compared to prior.  Follow up is
 recommended after resolution of this acute episode.
