                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia. S/p fall yesterday on anticoag  //
 ?bleed on CT head or pneumonia on CXR      .  NOTE IS MADE THAT THE THE
 PATIENT'S CT FROM ___ REFERRED TO MILD DIFFUSE SUBPLEURAL
 GROUND-GLASS OPACITIES AND INTERLOBULAR SEPTAL THICKENING THAT MIGHT INDICATE
 NSIP.
 
 COMPARISON:  Targeted review of CT from ___.  Also, chest x-ray
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly
 enlarged, likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes.  There is some patchy
 opacity there is multifocal patchy opacity notably at the right mid zone
 laterally, right base, left mid zone laterally and possibly also at the left
 base.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  No definite
 left-sided effusion.  There is slight increased retrocardiac opacity. There is
 upper zone redistribution no definite CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Borderline cardiomegaly,unchanged.
 2. Upper zone redistribution.  While an atypical appearance of CHF cannot be
 excluded, no definite CHF is seen.
 3. Multifocal faint opacities in the mid and lower zones bilaterally.  While
 this could reflect early pneumonic infiltrates or areas of aspiration, no
 frank consolidation to confirm the presence of an infectious infiltrate is
 identified.  In addition, note is made than in ___, the patient's CT
 showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and septal thickening that might
 indicate NSIP.
 4. Possible small right pleural effusion.
