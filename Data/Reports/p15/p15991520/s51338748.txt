 increasing resp. rate, SOB  // compare to prior cxr for changes     compare to
 prior cxr for changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___
 on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower today exaggerating pulmonary vascular engorgement,
 particularly at the lung bases where there is new atelectasis.
 
 No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.  Normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is
 seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or
 characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to
 the chest wall is clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal
 findings  should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail
 radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
