                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are low in volume without focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Hazy opacity on the lateral likely reflects
 prominent fat pad.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle could reflect
 scarring.  Heart size is normal with normal cardiomediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
