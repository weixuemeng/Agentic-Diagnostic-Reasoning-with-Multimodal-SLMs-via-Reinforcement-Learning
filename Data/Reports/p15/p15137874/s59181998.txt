                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with acute pancreatitis  // Evaluate for pleural
 effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ and ___.  Targeted
 review of abdominal chest CT from ___ fat included lung bases.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly low.  Allowing for this, the heart is not
 enlarged.  Aorta is minimally unfolded.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or
 pneumothorax is detected.  No pleural effusion is identified.  No free air
 seen beneath the diaphragms.
 
 A nodular density measuring approximately 6.5 mm in maximal diameter is noted 
 at the right lung base laterally.  This is in keeping with findings on the
 previous chest x-rays and with the calcified granuloma identified at the right
 lung base on the ___ abdominal CT.  It does now measure slightly
 larger than on the ___ chest x-ray (at which time it measured 5.4
 mm maximal diameter), but was clearly calcified on CT scan this could be due
 to technical differences.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute pulmonary process identified.  In particular, no pleural effusion
 detected.
 2. Nodular density at the right lung base corresponds the calcified granuloma
 seen on the ___ CT scan.
