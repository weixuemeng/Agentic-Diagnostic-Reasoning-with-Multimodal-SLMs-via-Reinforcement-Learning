                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Diastolic chronic heart failure, evaluation of pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing partial left
 lower lobe atelectasis has almost completely resolved.  There is only mild
 retrocardiac atelectasis on today's image.  The pre-existing minimal right
 pleural effusion could have slightly increased in extent.  The preexisting
 cardiomegaly with slightly enlarged pulmonary arteries and increased diameter
 of the peripheral pulmonary vessels, indicative of mild-to-moderate fluid
 overload, is unchanged.  No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
