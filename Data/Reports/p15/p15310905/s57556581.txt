                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The exam is limited due to patient rotation.  Assessment of the cardiac
 silhouette is difficult to assess given the presence of moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions, right greater than left.  Aortic knob calcifications are
 re- demonstrated.  Hazy opacification in the lungs with indistinctness of the
 vasculature likely reflects mild pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities may reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be
 completely excluded.  Previously seen tiny right apical pneumothorax is not
 clearly visualized on the current exam.  Marked degenerative changes of both
 glenohumeral joints are noted.  Right-sided chest tube terminates along the
 medial aspect of the mid right hemithorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, new compared to the prior exam.  Moderate size bilateral
 pleural effusions, right greater than left, relatively unchanged compared to
 the prior exam with PleurX catheter in unchanged position.  Previously
 described tiny right apical pneumothorax is not clearly demonstrated on the
 current exam.  Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis, but infection or
 aspiration are not completely excluded.
