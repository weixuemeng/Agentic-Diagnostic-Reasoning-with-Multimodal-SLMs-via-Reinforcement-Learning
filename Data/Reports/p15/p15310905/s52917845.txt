                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:40 AM, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with diastolic CHF, right pleural effusion. 
 Pleurx catheter capped.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are increasing and new opacification at
 the right lung base could be either edema or pneumonia.  Cardiac silhouette is
 distorted by rotation and leftward mediastinal shift.  Poor definition of the
 lower lobe bronchi suggests retained secretions.  No pneumothorax.
