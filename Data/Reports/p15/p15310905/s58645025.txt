                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion and lower lobe collapse.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is substantial change,
 most likely related primarily to the upright technique.  Substantial pleural
 effusions are seen bilaterally, more prominent on the left.  There is
 increased opacification in the retrocardiac area, consistent with volume loss
 involving the left lower lobe.  Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could
 reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure in a patient with mild enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette.
