                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___; ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including moderate
 cardiomegaly and enlargement of the main pulmonary artery contour.  There is
 mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta, which is calcified in a patchy fashion. 
 
 
 There are persistent pleural effusions, possibly decreased on the left, but
 similar-to-increased on the right and moderate in size.  In addition, a
 lenticular opacity along the posterior right hemithorax suggests a loculated
 effusion, similar-to-increased but not easy to compare to the recent prior
 radiographs due to slight differences in orientation.  Fissures are thickened.
 
 
 There is a moderate interstitial abnormality suggestive of pulmonary edema,
 increased since the prior examinations, but also a relatively confluent area
 of vague right lower lung opacification.  The possibility of coinciding
 pneumonia could be considered.  Short-term serial radiographic followup may be
 helpful to reevaluate.  
 
 There is exaggerated kyphotic curvature and a similar severe lower thoracic
 compression deformity.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggesting moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Relatively dense area of opacity increased at the right lung base.  The
 possibly of coinciding pneumonia could be considered; it may be appropriate to
 consider short-term follow-up radiographs to reassess.
