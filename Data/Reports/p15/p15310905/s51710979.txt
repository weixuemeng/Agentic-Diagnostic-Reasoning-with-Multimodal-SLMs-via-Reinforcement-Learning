                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea and history of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Compared to prior, there
 has been interval enlargement of the right-sided pleural effusion.  There is a
 persistent left-sided effusion which is grossly unchanged.  Superiorly, the
 lungs demonstrate mildly indistinct pulmonary vascular markings suggesting
 vascular congestion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, at least
 moderately enlarged.  Chronic changes seen at the shoulders bilaterally. Mid
 thoracic vertebral body severe compression deformity is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in size of right-sided pleural effusion with
 probable underlying atelectasis, noting that infection cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Persistent left effusion and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
