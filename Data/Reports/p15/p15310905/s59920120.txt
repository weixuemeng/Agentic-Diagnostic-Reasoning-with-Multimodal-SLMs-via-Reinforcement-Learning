                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Heart failure, status post diuresis.  Evaluate for interval
 change in pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___ and ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are
 unchanged.  Diffuse interstitial opacity is consistent with moderate pulmonary
 edema, stable in severity.  A more focal, new vague opacity in the right upper
 lobe is likely the sequela of pulmonary edema, though attention on followup
 radiographs is recommended.
 
 The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged.  The pulmonary arteries
 are markedly enlarged, unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
