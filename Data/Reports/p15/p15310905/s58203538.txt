                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, here to evaluate for evidence of acute CHF exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___ and CT of the chest
 last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Reticulonodular opacities throughout both lungs are more
 pronounced, either pulmonary edema or miliary nodules.  A small-to-moderate
 left pleural effusion is unchanged from ___ with associated atelectasis. 
 Horizontal linear opacities in the right lung base are most likely reflect
 plate-like atelectasis.  A small right pleural effusion is present.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  The main pulmonary artery again appears dilated.  A
 subtle ovoid or tubular density projecting over the right upper lung zone, not
 seen on ___ represent mucoid impaction.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged with calcification of the
 aortic knob.  Glenohumeral joint degenerative changes are again noted.  A
 compression fracture deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Reticulonodular opacities throughout the lungs.  If this does not improve
 with treatment for pulmonary edema, CT should be performed to see if there are
 miliary nodules.
 2.  Stable cardiomegaly.
 3.  Mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion
 with associated bibasilar atelectasis.
