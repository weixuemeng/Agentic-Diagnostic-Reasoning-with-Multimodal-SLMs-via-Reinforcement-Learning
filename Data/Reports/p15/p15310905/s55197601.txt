                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest demonstrates increased left lung
 opacification with some minimal residual aerated lung at the left lung apex
 with leftward mediastinal shift suggesting left lower lobe collapse. 
 Right-sided pleural catheter remains in place.  Increased interstitial
 markings seen throughout the lungs and are more conspicuous when compared to
 prior.  Right-sided pleural effusion seen laterally with possible fluid within
 the fissure projecting as hazy opacity projecting over the right mid lung. 
 Chronic changes seen at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity in the left hemithorax with minimal aerated
 lung superiorly and leftward mediastinal shift.  This is likely due to a
 component of left lower lobe atelectasis and possible underlying effusion as
 well.  Right-sided pleural effusion appears slightly larger compared to prior.
 Increased interstitial markings suggesting a component of pulmonary edema
 potentially infection.
