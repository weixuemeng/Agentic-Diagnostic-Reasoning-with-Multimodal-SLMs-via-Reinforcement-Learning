 pulmonary edema     please eval for PNA, pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Lung volumes are chronically low.  Pulmonary vascular engorgement and slight
 cardiomegaly are consistent with late pregnancy.  Opacification of both lower
 lungs medially could be due to atelectasis alone.  There is probably no
 pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion.
