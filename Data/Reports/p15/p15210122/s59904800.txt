 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, recently postop from cervical spinal surgery.

 radiograph, which could represent atelectasis versus less likely pneumonia. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Bony structures are intact.  Partially imaged cervical fusion hardware is
 noted in the lower neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable atelectasis, less likely pneumonia in the left
 infrahilar region.
