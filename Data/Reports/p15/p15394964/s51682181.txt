 INDICATION:   ___F with intubation tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is seen 3.6 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube passes
 below the inferior field of view with the side-port within the stomach. There
 are linear bibasilar opacities which are more extensive on the left compared
 to the right.  Additional region of patchy retrocardiac opacity is noted and
 silhouette of the descending thoracic aorta is not clearly delineated. 
 Superiorly the lungs are clear.  There is no evidence of large effusion or
 pneumothorax based on a supine film.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is  within
 normal limits.   Tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta is noted.  No
 displaced fractures.

 ET tube in appropriate position.  Left basilar opacities, likely in part
 atelectasis noting that infection or aspiration are possible.  Attention on
 followup suggested.
