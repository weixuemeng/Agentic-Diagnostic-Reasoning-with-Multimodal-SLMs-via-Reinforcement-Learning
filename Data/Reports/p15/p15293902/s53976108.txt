                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation, here to evaluate position of lines and
 tubes.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior study is available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating at the
 level of the carina.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm
 and out of view on this image.  A right internal jugular central venous
 catheter is in place with the tip terminating at the mid-to-lower SVC.  The
 inspiratory lung volumes are low.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 accentuated due to low lung volumes.  There is apparent widening of the
 mediastinum, which is due in part to unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Minimal
 calcification of the aortic knob is noted.  The lungs are clear without large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No focal consolidation is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube with tip at the carina.  Recommend retraction.
 2.  Otherwise, satisfactory position of lines and tubes.  No pneumothorax.
