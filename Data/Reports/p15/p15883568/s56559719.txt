                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with left lower quadrant pain starting earlier
 today.  Evaluate for ischemic colitis or abdominal perforation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Low
 lung volumes are present with crowding of bronchovascular structures, but no
 overt pulmonary edema.  Hazy opacities in the bilateral, left greater than
 right, lower lobes with the left lower lobe opacity having a peripheral
 triangular appearance on the lateral view.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle, likely representing a small pleural effusion.  No right pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 No subdiaphragmatic free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Triangular peripheral morphology of the left lower lobe, compatible with
 infarction, as the subsequent abdominal pelvic CTA demonstrated a left lower
 lobe pulmonary embolism. Trace left pleural effusion.
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis.
 3. No subdiaphragmatic free air.
