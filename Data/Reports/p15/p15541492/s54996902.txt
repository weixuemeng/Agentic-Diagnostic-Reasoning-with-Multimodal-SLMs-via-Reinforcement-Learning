                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status and hypotension.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  Linear opacity
 identified in the right upper lung laterally suggestive of atelectasis versus
 scarring.  Elsewhere the lungs are clear within the limitation of a
 significantly rotated exam.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly
 unremarkable.  Osseous and soft tissue structures appear normal.  There is
 suggestion of prior healed lateral left rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of right upper lung atelectasis versus
 scarring.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process given limitation of this
 significantly rotated examination.
