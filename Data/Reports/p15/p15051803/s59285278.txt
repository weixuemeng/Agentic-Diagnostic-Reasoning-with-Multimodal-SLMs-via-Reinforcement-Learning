                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Recent pneumonia, recurrent cough.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Faint increased opacity overlying the
 spine seen only in the lateral view in the mid chest is suggestive of an
 infectious process.  Plate-like atelectasis in the lower lobes are larger on
 the left side.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Mild
 degenerative changes are in the thoracic spine.
 
 
 Impression:
 Previously described opacities in the right upper lobe seen in the frontal
 view are no longer seen.
 
 Opacities described in the lateral view in the current study, though were not
 present in the prior study, could be due to a same infectious process, but in
 a different location.
