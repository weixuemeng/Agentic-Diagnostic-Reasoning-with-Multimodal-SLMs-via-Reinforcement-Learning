 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with cough and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 There is a faint opacity in the right upper lobe suggestive of an infectious
 process. There is mild right lower lobe atelectasis. Otherwise, the remainder
 of the lungs are clear with no evidence of other consolidations, effusions, or
 pneumothoraces.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Calcified
 costochondral junctions are visualized.  Otherwise, the remainder of osseous
 structures are grossly normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  There is a faint opacity in the right upper lobe suggestive of an
 infectious process such as right upper lobe pneumonia. A followup study is
 recommended in 6 weeks to assess for interval change.
