  1.5 x 1.1 cm partially calcified right upper lobe pulmonary nodule may
  represent sequela of prior infection such as tuberculosis. Neoplastic nodule
  is less likely but still a possibility.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea. Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In the right upper lobe there is an irregularly shaped pulmonary nodule
 measuring 1.5 x 1.1 cm, with subtle high-density regions, and centrally low
 density.  Hyperlucency at the left lung apex could represent a bulla or severe
 emphysematous change. Diffuse interstitial opacities are likely in keeping
 with underlying parenchymal disease.  No focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.5 x 1.1 cm partially calcified right upper lobe pulmonary nodule may
 represent sequela of prior infection such as tuberculosis. Neoplastic nodule
 is less likely but still a possibility.  Cross sectional imaging is
 recommended.
