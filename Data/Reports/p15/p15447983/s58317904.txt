                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with metastatic breast cancer, fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which appears mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  There is crowding of bronchovascular structures with possible
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Left upper lobe lobulated mass is not
 substantially changed in the interval.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 patchy opacities in lung bases, likely atelectasis.  Please note that
 infection cannot be completely excluded.
 2. Unchanged appearance of left upper lobe lobulated mass, better assessed on
 the recent chest CT.
