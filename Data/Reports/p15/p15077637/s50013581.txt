                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation.  Assess tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  NG tube is seen with tip in the fundus of the stomach and side port
 at the level of the GE junction.  ET tube is in appropriate position with tip
 3 cm above the level of the carina.
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  Linear opacity in the left lower lobe likely
 represents atelectasis, however, may represent aspiration pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  The right pleural surface is clear.  The left
 costophrenic angle is not fully imaged; however, no large pleural effusion
 seen.  No pneumothorax. Mildly enlarged heart is likely attributed to AP
 technique and supine positioning.  Mediastinal contour and hila are normal. 
 Medialization of aortic arch calcifications  without irregularity of the
 aortic knob contour or apical cap is of unclear significance.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Consider advancing NG tube 3 cm for better seating in the stomach.
 2.  ET tube in appropriate position.
 3.  Medialization of the aortic arch calcifications may be positional in
 nature; however, if clinical concern for aortic pathology further evaluation
 with CT may be helpful.
 4.  Left lower lobe linear opacity is likely atelectasis, however, may
 represent aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.
