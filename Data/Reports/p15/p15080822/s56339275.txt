                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postop day ileocecectomy, sinus tachycardia and shortness of breath,
 rule out acute  pulmonary process.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.  No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for
 comparison.  I
 
 nspiratory volumes are slightly low.  Allowing for this, the possibility of
 mild cardiomegaly cannot be excluded.  Patchy opacities at both lung bases are
 nonspecific, but given low lung volumes, could represent atelectasis. 
 Pneumonic infiltrates or areas of aspiration are considered less likely unless
 there is a supporting clinical history.  There is minimal atelectasis at the
 left lung base laterally.  No gross effusion.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity at both lung bases in the setting of low lung
 volumes, likely represents atelectasis.  Early infiltrates or areas of
 aspiration are considered less likely unless there is a supporting clinical
 history.
