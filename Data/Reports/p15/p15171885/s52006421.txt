                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Crackles at the right base with diminished breath sounds. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is no consolidation, pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  Calcifications are noted along the aortic arch.  In the descending
 aorta, there is mild dilation, which is incompletely characterized.  This is
 not significantly changed from the prior radiograph.  The heart size is mildly
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Stable hyperinflation, consistent with COPD, and mild cardiomegaly.
 3.  Stable dilated descending thoracic aorta; if further evaluation is
 indicated, could obtain a CT of the chest.
