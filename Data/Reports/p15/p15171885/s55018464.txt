 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable, within normal limits. The
 thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous, with aortic arch calcifications again seen
 in an unchanged configuration. The bilateral hila are within normal limits. 
 Minimal opacity at the right heart border likely represents crowding of normal
 bronchovascular structures.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 There is no focal lung consolidation.  Again seen is a right mid lung
 calcified granuloma.  There are likely trace bilateral pleural effusions.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Probable trace bilateral pleural
 effusions.  No focal  consolidation.
