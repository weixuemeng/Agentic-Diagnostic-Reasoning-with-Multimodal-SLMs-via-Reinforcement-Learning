                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Palpitations and dizziness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is heavily calcified. 
 Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  A
 small calcified granuloma projects over the right upper lobe.  There is slight
 blunting in the left costophrenic sulcus suggesting minor atelectasis with a
 possible trace left-sided pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 bones appear demineralized.  A mild upper thoracic compression deformity
 appears unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus suggesting atelectasis
 and possible trace effusion, but otherwise no findings suggestive of acute
 disease.
