                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with history of afib on digoxin/xarelto, IDDM, CHF, CAD, here
 with hallucinations and worsening AMS (argumentative, unusual behavior,
 yelling), that has worsened significantly in last 2 days. Has crackles at
 bilateral bases.  // pneumonia?   pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is now substantial
 enlargement of cardiac silhouette with moderate pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac
 opacification with obscuration of the hemidiaphragms consistent with volume
 loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. Appropriate clinical
 setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
 There is an impression upon the left-sided lower cervical trachea with
 displacement of the trachea to the right, suggestive of a thyroid mass.
 Pacer device is essentially unchanged.
