                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with septic shock, CHF exacerbation, marked
 effusions on CT ?RLL atelectasis vs PNA, ?retrocardiac opacity, please
 evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT is in standard position.  The single lead left chest AICD appears
 intact and unchanged in position.  The lung volumes remain low.  Compared to
 the prior exam, increased opacities in the bilateral lung bases may be
 secondary to dependent  bilateral pleural effusions on a semi-erect exam today
 compared to an upright exam on the prior and are slightly worse.  Retrocardiac
 opacity persists and may reflect underlying atelectasis or underlying
 pneumonia.  Moderate cardiomegaly is overall unchanged.  Mild moderate
 pulmonary vascular congestion is likely.  No mediastinal widening.  No
 pneumothorax.  Mild Levoconvex scoliosis of the lower thoracic spine is
 unchanged.   The enteric tube traverses the diaphragm but the tip is not seen.
 The stomach is distended.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval increase in pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion and
 atelectasis.
