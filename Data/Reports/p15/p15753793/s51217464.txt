                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post intubation.  Evaluate for ET tube
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier on the same day at 12:25
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the ET tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina in appropriate
 position.  An enteric tube is partially visualized.  There is mild pulmonary
 edema.  Retrocardiac opacity is unchanged and may represent a combination of
 atelectasis and effusion, although developing consolidation cannot be
 excluded.  Probable small right pleural effusion is also noted.  A left chest
 single lead AICD is in unchanged position.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ET tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina in satisfactory position.
 
 2.  Persistent mild pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Unchanged retrocardiac opacity which may be a combination of atelectasis
 and effusion, although developing consolidation cannot be excluded.
