                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Bowel AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with septic shock, CHF exacerbation, hypoxemic
 respiratory failure, intubated // please evalute for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.  CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated. Lung volumes are low, overall unchanged.  Large right
 pleural effusion has decreased in size, now moderate.  Small left pleural
 effusion is overall unchanged.  Interval decrease in edema, now mild. 
 Bilateral atelectasis is overall unchanged.  The heart is mildly enlarged and
 overall unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  The trachea is deviated rightward and
 could be potentially explain by a predominantly larger left goiter a noted on
 recent CT; however, deviation is slightly more prominent on radiograph
 compared to prior exams in in the setting of recent left internal jugular vein
 placement, correlation for possible hematoma is recommended.
 
 The left internal jugular vein catheter tip crosses the midline and courses
 upward in the SVC with the tip now in the upper SVC.  The ETT is in standard
 position.  An enteric tube traverses the midline and ends in the right upper
 quadrant in an air-filled stomach - the side port is probably at the
 gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced.  The single-lead cardiac
 device is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions and edema.
 2. Left internal jugular vein malpositioned and tip orients cephalad in the
 upper SVC. Recommend again pulling back at least 2-3 cm and repositioning.
 3. NGT too high - recommend advancing several centimeters.
 4. Right-ward trachea deviation could be from predominant left goiter, but
 correlate with clinical assessment for possible hematoma given recent left IJ
 placement.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with ___,
 the Green resident on MICU on the telephone on ___ at 10:42 AM, after
 discovery of the findings.
