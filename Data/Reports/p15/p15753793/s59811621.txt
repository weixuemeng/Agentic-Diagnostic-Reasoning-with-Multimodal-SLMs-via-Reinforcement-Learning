                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension, cough, possible sepsis. Status
 post left internal jugular CVL placmeent
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC.
 Left-sided AICD device is noted with single lead terminating in the region of
 the right ventricle. Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
 again demonstrated. Mediastinal contour is unchanged with rightward tracheal
 deviation due to a thyroid goiter. There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion. Hilar contours are unremarkable. Streaky opacities in the lung
 bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  There are possible trace bilateral
