 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sepsis, intubated // evaluate OGT
 placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___, from earlier on the same day
 at 04:40.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT in standard placement. NG tube traverses the midline can't tip is not
 seen, but the stomach remains distended.  Single lead cardiac device is
 unchanged in position.  Left internal jugular vein catheter traverses the
 midline with its tip pointing cephalad in the mid to upper SVC, unchanged. 
 Right pleural effusion is moderate, overall unchanged.  Small left pleural
 effusion is probably unchanged, although a the cardiac device projects over
 the left lower hemithorax. Bilateral atelectasis is unchanged.  Heart size is
 grossly unchanged.  Apparent rightward shift the trachea is overall similar
 and may be secondary to the a predominantly left-sided goiter but correlation
 for hematoma is again advised.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Unchanged bilateral, right greater than left pleural effusions.  Overall
 no change in edema.
 2.  NG tube still could be advanced.
 3. Left IJ still could be repositioned by pulling back at least 2-3 cm.
 4.  Correlate as previously discussed for left goiter versus hematoma.
