                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal.  Assess interval change in left pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 22:24 p.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film,and allowing for technical differences, the
 small-to-moderate left effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation
 is unchanged.  Possibility of a tiny residual left pneumothorax cannot be
 entirely excluded.   Again seen is a spiculated opacity in the right upper
 zone laterally, with chain sutures at the right lung apex.  Minimal blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle is consistent with a small right effusion. 
 Background COPD and parenchymal scarring is suspected.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged. ?slight hyperinflation of the right lung, with slight
 leftward positioning of the cardiac silhouette. Multiple left sided rib
 fractures noted, concordant with recent CT findings.  Incidental note is made
 of surgical anchors in relation to the right proximal humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Equivocal tiny left apical pneumothorax.  Otherwise, doubt
 significant interval change.
