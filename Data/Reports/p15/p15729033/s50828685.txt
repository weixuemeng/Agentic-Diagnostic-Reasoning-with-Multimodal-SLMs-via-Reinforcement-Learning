                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Oblique positioning.  Compared with ___ at 14:44 p.m., the left-sided
 chest tube has been removed.  There is a possible small left apical
 pneumothorax.  Otherwise, I doubt significant change.  Again seen are left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with small effusion, sutures in the
 right upper lung, and atelectasis at the right base.  Mild upper zone
 redistribution, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of left chest tube.  Suspect tiny left apical
 pneumothorax.
