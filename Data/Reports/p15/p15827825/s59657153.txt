 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is at the
 upper limits of normal in size with a dual-channel pacer device in place. 
 Extensive calcification of the mitral annulus is again noted.  Hyperexpansion
 of the lungs suggests underlying chronic pulmonary disease.  No evidence of
 acute pneumonia or vascular congestion. Calcification at the level of the
 azygos vein is consistent with prior granulomatous disease exposure.
