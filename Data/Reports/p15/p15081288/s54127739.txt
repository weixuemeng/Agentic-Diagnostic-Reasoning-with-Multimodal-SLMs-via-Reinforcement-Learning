 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:38 PM
  Stable subcutaneous air in the neck soft tissues and left chest wall.
  Relative lucency of the left base persists suggesting a small pneumothorax
  though no clear pleural line is evident.  Multiple right-sided rib fx again
  noted.  Bibasilar opacities have increased - likely progressive atelectasis.
  No large effusions.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. ___ p___ ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of trauma with multiple bilateral rib fractures,
 subcutaneous emphysema, and left pneumothorax.  Evaluate left pneumothorax for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT torso from outside facility dated ___, and
 chest radiographs and chest radiograph from ___, at 12:56 p.m.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  Subtle areas of lucency
 overlie the left lung which suggest that the pneumothorax is persistent.  The
 extensive subcutaneous emphysema within the soft tissues of the neck, left
 shoulder and left flank is unchanged.  A definite pleural contour is not seen.
 Multiple displaced right posterior rib fractures are unchanged.
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is slightly worse.  There is left basilar
 atelectasis obscuring the hemidiaphragm.  The hilar and mediastinal contours
 are otherwise normal.  There is no pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent left pneumothorax which is much better appreciated on the prior
 CT.
 2.  Unchanged extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the soft tissues of the
 neck, left shoulder and left flank.
 3.  Multiple unchanged displaced rib fractures.
 4.  Worsening mild pulmonary vascular congestion and left basilar atelectasis.
