                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post MVC with multiple rib fractures, question of
 consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest. Multiple rib fractures are again
 seen.  There is a decrease in amount of subcutaneous emphysema.  There may be
 a miniscule pneumothorax in the left apex.  There is increased layering
 pleural effusion on the right as well as a new right-sided loculated pleural
 or extrapleural effusion.  The mild pulmonary edema seen previously has
 resolved.  The heart is normal.  The left lower lobe atelectasis is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No new focal consolidation.
 
 2.  Increased small right pleural effusion and new, loculated, right pleural
 or extrapleural fluid, could be due to interval bleeding of displaced rib
 fractures.
 
 3.  Pulmonary edema has resolved.
 
 4.  Decrease in subcutaneous emphysema.
