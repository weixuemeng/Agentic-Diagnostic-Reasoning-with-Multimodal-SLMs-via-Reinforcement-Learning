                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p fall with traumatic brain injury and
 ___ fracture status post intubation.  Evaluate interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube, left PICC line, and enteric tube are unchanged.  Heart size
 is stable.  Since the prior study there is increased opacification at the
 right lung base obscuring the right hemidiaphragm, which may represent the
 presence of a new pleural effusion or change in patient positioning. 
 Retrocardiac atelectasis is similar.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New opacification of the right lung base may represent development of a new
 pleural effusion versus change in patient positioning.  Pneumonia should be
 considered as well.
