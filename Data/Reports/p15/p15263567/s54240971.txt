                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with fever, recent fall, evaluate for pneumonia
 or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 A single portable AP semi-erect view of the chest was obtained.  Elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm is chronic.  Low lung volumes accentuate the pulmonary
 vasculature.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Allowing for low lung volumes, no
 definite focal consolidation or large effusion.  Apparent enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is likely in part due to the portable technique and the low
 lung volumes.  Mediastinal contour is grossly unremarkable.  Linear basilar
 opacities likely represent atelectasis.
 
 A fracture is noted through the neck of the right humeral, which also
 demonstrates evidence of previous rotator cuff repair.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Markedly low lung volumes without definite evidence of focal consolidation
 or pulmonary edema. Doubt CHF. 
 2. Acute fracture of the right proximal humerus. (Previously reported on
 shoulder xray exam from ___.
