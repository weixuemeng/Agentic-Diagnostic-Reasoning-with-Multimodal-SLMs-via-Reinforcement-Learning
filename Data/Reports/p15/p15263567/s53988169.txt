  Persistent low lung volumes and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Right
  base opacity could be due to atelectasis or consolidation.
  
  Study limited for the assessment of rib fractures.  If there is clinical
  concern for such, CT is more sensitive and should be considered.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cellulitis and recent fall  // eval for
 PNA, also look for rib fractures with recent fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes persist in the patient is somewhat rotated.  Elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm persist.  Right base opacity could be due to atelectasis
 although consolidation, potentially due to infection or aspiration, is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are not well
 assessed due to the low lung volumes although mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable and similar to prior..  Chronic deformity at the right shoulder
 is re- demonstrated.  The study is suboptimal for the assessment of rib
 fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent low lung volumes and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Right
 base opacity could be due to atelectasis or consolidation.
 
 Study limited for the assessment of rib fractures.  If there is clinical
 concern for such, CT is more sensitive and should be considered.
