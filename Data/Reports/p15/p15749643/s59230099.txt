                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough for 10 days.  Left lower
 lobe coarse crackles, evaluate for abnormality.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding PA and
 lateral chest examination of ___.  The heart is mildly enlarged. 
 No typical configurational abnormality is identified.  Unremarkable appearance
 of thoracic aorta with small calcifications in the wall at the level of the
 arch.  The pulmonary vasculature shows an upper zone re-distribution pattern,
 but no evidence of interstitial or alveolar edema.  The lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses are free, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax in the
 apical area.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are
 present.  When comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of
 ___, findings are stable and thus there is no evidence of any
 acute parenchymal infiltrate or significant congestion in particular in the
 left lower lung area where coarse crackles were noted.  The mild degree of
 cardiac enlargement is stable and compatible with clinical history of atrial
 fibrillation.
