                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of SBO, NG tube placement, please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The enteric tube terminates within the body of the stomach, however
 the side-holes may be at the gastro-esophageal junction, and needs to be
 advanced.  Subdiaphragmatically noted is distention of the small bowel
 consistent with patient's known small bowel obstruction.  The 3 cm perihilar
 left lung nodule is unchanged. Multiple lung nodules continue to be seen,
 better evaluated on the prior CT.  There is mild cardiomegaly which is stable
 since ___.  There is stable widened mediastinum likely secondary to
 fat infiltration.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  NG tube extends below the diaphragm with the tip likely in the
 body of the stomach, however the side holes maybe in the lower esophagus. This
 tube should be advanced.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by telephone at 5:___p
