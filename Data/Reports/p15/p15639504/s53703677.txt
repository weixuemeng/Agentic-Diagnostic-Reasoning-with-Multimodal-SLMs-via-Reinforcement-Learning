                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with hyperglycemia, confusion  // r/o ich
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and outside chest CT from ___. .
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear of focal consolidation. There is however persistent
 opacity projecting over then lower lungs on the lateral view. This likely
 correlates to underlying mass involving the right tenth rib with adjacent
 atelectasis seen on prior chest CT. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No
 acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. Focal opacity projecting over the posterior
 lung bases on the lateral view is likely related to destructive mass lesion
 involving the posterior right rib with adjacent atelectasis.
