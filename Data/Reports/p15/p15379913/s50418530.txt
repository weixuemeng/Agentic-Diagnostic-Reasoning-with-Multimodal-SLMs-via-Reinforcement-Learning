                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope, question acute process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Minimal spurring along the anterosuperior corner of a lower thoracic vertebral
 body is noted -- unless there is focal tendernes in this locaiton to suggest
 an acute injruy, this would be consistent with mild degenerative change.
