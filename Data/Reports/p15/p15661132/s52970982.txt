 vascular congestion. There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 Again seen is chronic anterior dislocation of left shoulder and degenerative
 changes at the right glenohumeral joint.  No displaced rib fractures are seen.

 No pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fracture seen, however if there is high
