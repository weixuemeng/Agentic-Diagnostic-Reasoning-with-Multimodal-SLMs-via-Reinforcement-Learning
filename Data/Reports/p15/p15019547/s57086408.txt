 HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus I, now with hyperglycemia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Subtle patchy opacity projecting over the right upper lung could be due to
 overlap of vascular structures, but infection may be present.  The left lung
 is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle right upper lung patchy opacities nonspecific, could represent overlap
 of vascular structures however focus of infection may be present.  Findings
 could be further evaluated with shallow oblique radiographs.
