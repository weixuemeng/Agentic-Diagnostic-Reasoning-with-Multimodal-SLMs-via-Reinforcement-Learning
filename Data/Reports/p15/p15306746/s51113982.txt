  Relative lucency at the left apex without a clear pleural line is concering
  but indeterminate for pneumothorax.  Suggest repeat radiograph if symptoms
  persist.  Stable severe scoliosis.  -D/W Dr ___ ___ phone ___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:27 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with urinary retention and renal failure.  Suspect
 CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 The patient has had median sternotomy and coronary bypass grafting.  Heart
 size is normal.  Lungs are mildly hyperinflated but free of any indication of
 cardiac decompensation or pneumonia.  Several focal abnormalities projecting
 over the lungs are unlikely to be clinically significant lung lesions.  An
 elliptical opacity, roughly 3 x 4 cm projects over the left upper chest at the
 level of the second and third anterior ribs.  Its oblique orientation and
 between the sharp inferomedial margin and a vague superolateral margin
 suggests this is not a lung lesion.  It could be a fissural pleural
 loculation, or pleural or extrapleural lipoma.  An irregularly shaped 12 mm
 wide highly dense lesion projecting over the right fourth anterior rib could
 be calcification in the rib or pleura.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A ___-mm wide oval nodular opacity projecting over the left
 fourth anterior interspace could be either a lung or chest wall lesion.
 
 Dystrophic calcification of the apical pleural surfaces bilaterally should not
 be mistaken for pneumothorax.
