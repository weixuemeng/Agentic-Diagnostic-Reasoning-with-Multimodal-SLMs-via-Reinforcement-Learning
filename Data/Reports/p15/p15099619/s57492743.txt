                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest pain, AFib, hypertension.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  A faint ill-defined opacity in the right lower lung
 projecting over the anterior sixth right rib could be superimposition of
 normal structures, but the lung abnormality needs to be excluded; shallow
 obliques are recommended for a more standard position.  There is a probably
 calcified granuloma in the left upper lobe.  There are moderate-to-severe
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
