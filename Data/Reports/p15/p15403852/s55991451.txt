                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with as above  // s/p AVR/MVR w/FUO r/o
 infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, right internal jugular dialysis
 catheter has been placed, terminating deep within the right atrium.  Airspace
 opacities in the right lung have substantially improved with residual minimal
 perihilar edema remaining.  There remains more extensive perihilar
 consolidation on the left, which could reflect asymmetric edema with or
 without coexisting pneumonia.  Left lower lobe atelectasis and small to
 moderate left pleural effusion persist.
