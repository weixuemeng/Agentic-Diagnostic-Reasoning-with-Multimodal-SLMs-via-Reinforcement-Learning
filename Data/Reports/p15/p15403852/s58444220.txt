 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p redo AVR/MVR/VAP/trach/PEG  // eval VAP 
 eval VAP
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  There has been
 decrease in the degree of pulmonary edema.  The area of coalescence in the
 left hilar region is less prominent.  This suggests that it it represented
 some asymmetric edema rather than superimposed pneumonia, though it would be
 difficult to unequivocally exclude pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
 The monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
