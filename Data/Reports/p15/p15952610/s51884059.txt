                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette without pulmonary edema.  Crowding of the vascular structures at
 the lung bases and small areas of atelectasis, left more than right.  No
 evidence of pneumonia on the current image.  Of note, is a relatively dense
 right-sided aspect of the mediastinum, along the paratracheal stripe, that
 might be caused by the patient's constitution.  A repeat radiograph in PA and
 lateral projections could clarify the mediastinal morphology.
