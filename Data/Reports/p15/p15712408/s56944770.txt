                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and a chest CT from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Bibasilar
 plate-like atelectasis is slightly improved from prior exams.  There is no
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Please note, given the presence of atelectasis, the
 possibility of a small component of pneumonia is impossible to exclude in the
 correct clinical setting.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and
 normal.  No pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar plate-like atelectasis, slightly improved.  Please note
 a subjacent early pneumonia cannot be excluded at the lung bases.  Correlate
 clinically.
