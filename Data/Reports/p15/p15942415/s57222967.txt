                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall from standing with right-sided intracranial hematoma noted.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged with left ventricular prominence.  The aorta
 is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  The hilar contours are unchanged, and
 the pulmonary vascular markings are not engorged.  Increased interstitial
 opacities are re- demonstrated predominantly within the lung bases, and appear
 chronic.  There is hyperinflation of lungs with attenuation of pulmonary
 vascular markings towards the apices compatible with underlying emphysema.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly demonstrated.
 There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures.  No definite
 displaced rib fractures are noted.  Compression deformity of a mid thoracic
 vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No definitely displaced rib fractures noted.  If there is continued
 clinical concern for rib fracture, consider a dedicated rib series.
 
 2. Emphysema with chronic interstitial changes at the lung bases.
