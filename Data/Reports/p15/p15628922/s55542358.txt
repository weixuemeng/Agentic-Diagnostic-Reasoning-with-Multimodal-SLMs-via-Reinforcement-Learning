 no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Perihilar pulmonary opacities consistent
 with moderate pulmonary edema are unchanged.  Retrocardiac opacity is not as
 evident on the previous study compatible with atelectasis.  Heart size is top
 normal on the current examination, minimally increased from the previous
 study.
