                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with multiple lines and intubation.  Assess for
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 16:22.
 
 SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube terminates just above
 the level of the carina, therefore, proximal reposition by 1.5 cm is
 recommended.  The tip of a nasoenteric catheter is at the same level as the
 endotracheal tube, findings concerning for a coiled tube in the nasopharynx. 
 A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  A
 left approach AICD/pacemaker has leads terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle, unchanged from prior.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is
 probable bibasilar atelectasis and mild vascular congestion.  No overt
 interstitial edema is identified.  There is no large pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube at level of carina, proximal repositioning by at least
 1.5 cm is recommended.
 2.  Malpositioned nasoenteric catheter, likely coiled in the nasopharynx. 
 Repositioning recommended.
 3.  Probable bibasilar atelectasis and mild vascular congestion.
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the above findings (#1 and #2) and
 recommendations regarding the tube positions to Dr. ___ at 8:17 am
 on ___ by telephone, ___ minutes after discovery.
