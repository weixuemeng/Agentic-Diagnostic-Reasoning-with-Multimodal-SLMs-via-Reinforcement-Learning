                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of atrial fibrillation, on
 Coumadin, hypertension, CVA, seizure disorder with new left basal ganglia
 stroke, hypotensive, requiring Levophed, intubated, decreased responsiveness,
 now extubated, assess for interval change,  now the patient is extubated.
 
 FINDINGS:  Total of six images were provided, all obtained with patient in
 supine position.  The patient is now extubated.  Previously described pacer in
 left axillary position connected to intracavitary electrodes unchanged. 
 Status post sternotomy as bypass surgery as before.  Marked cardiomegaly is
 now present and hazy density over the bases indicative of bilateral pleural
 effusion obliterating the diaphragmatic contours and the lateral pleural
 sinuses.  Images taken over the lower chest and upper abdomen demonstrate the
 presence of an NG tube which reaches well below the diaphragm and curves along
 the body of the stomach.When comparison is made to the next preceding portable
 chest examination of ___, the now massive bilateral pleural
 effusions are new.  Layering effusions in the dependent posterior pleural
 compartments make it difficult to assess the status of the pulmonary
 vasculature but most likely a congestion is present.  No pneumothorax can be
 identified.  Referring physician, ___ was paged at 1:55 p.m.
