                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post MVC with neck pain, here to evaluate for acute
 intrathoracic injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA of the chest dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  Streaky
 opacification at the right medial lung base most likely reflects atelectasis. 
 There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is detected.  Moderate pleural parenchymal scarring is noted
 in the bilateral lung apices which appears symmetrical.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal in size.  A cardiac monitoring device projects over
 the left hemithorax.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  The trachea is midline.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted throughout the
 thoracic spine.  No evidence of displaced rib fracture or acute osseous
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No displaced rib fracture or acute osseous abnormality detected. 
 If there is clinical concern for rib fracture, dedicated rib series could be
 obtained for further evaluation.
