                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:  On the lateral view there is increased opacity along the posterior
 lower lung, which is not well substantiated on the frontal view and could be
 due to underlying atelectasis, although an early/mild infectious process is
 not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain, back pain, dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Again, there
 is prominence of the hila, which may be due to lymphadenopathy in this patient
 with known sarcoidosis.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  No large
 pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Persistent prominence of the hila may relate
 to lymphadenopathy in this patient with reported sarcoidosis.  No focal
 consolidation or evidence of pneumothorax.
