                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 2.3 cm above
 the carina.  An NG tube is present.  The tip is obscured due to overlying
 anatomy and its position cannot be confirmed beyond the lower mediastinum. 
 Right PICC line is present, tip overlying the right atrium.  No pneumothorax
 is detected.  
 
 There is cardiomegaly, with upper zone redistribution and mild vascular
 blurring, consistent with CHF.  The left hemidiaphragm is elevated.  In
 addition, there is some patchy retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation and minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle.  
 
 Compared with ___, the CHF findings and the opacity at left base are
 similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 ET tube in satisfactory position.  Limited assessment of NT tube.
