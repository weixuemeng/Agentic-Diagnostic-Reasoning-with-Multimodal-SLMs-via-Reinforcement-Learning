                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New atrial fibrillation.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged including cardiomegaly and distended
 mediastinal vessels.  There is interval improvement in right basal opacities,
 that might reflect the inflammatory origin or potentially aspiration.  There
 is mild vascular engorgement but no overt pulmonary edema.  There is no
 appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax demonstrated.
