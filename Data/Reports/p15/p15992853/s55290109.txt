                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with obtundation, s/p dobhoff placement;
 evaluate for placement of tube in stomach.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multiple images were obtained. The initial radiograph demonstrates the newly
 placed Dobbhoff tube entering into this right mainstem bronchus and into the
 right lower lung parenchyma. This was subsequently removed, and an NG tube was
 placed. Subsequent images demonstrate the newly placed NG tube traversing the
 diaphragm with its tip ending in the expected location of the stomach in the
 left upper quadrant, although it is unclear if the position of the side port
 is past the GE junction. No pneumoperitoneum or pneumothorax.
 
 From the most recently obtained repeat films, a new small-to-moderate left
 pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis has developed since ___.
 Otherwise, no significant change since ___. Stable bilateral small
 lung volumes. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Stable moderate
 cardiomegaly. Increased retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms and partial
 obscuration of the lateral aspect of the descending aorta, suggestive of
 atelectasis although a developing pneumonia cannot be excluded. The dual-lead
 cardiac pacemaker device appears unchanged in position, with one tip in the
 right atrium and the other in the right ventricle.
 
 Stable significant bilateral degenerative changes in the glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. NGT traverses the diaphragm and ends in the stomach, although the side port
 is likely above the GE junction.  Recommend advancing the NG tube several
 centimeters to ensure that the side port is past the GE junction.
 
 2. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion, new since ___.
 
 3. No pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 ___, the referring provider, on the telephone on ___ at 4:17 PM, 1
 minute after discovery of the findings.
