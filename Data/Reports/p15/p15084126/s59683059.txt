                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Auto stem cell transplantation with amyloidosis, admitted for
 severe pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 right-sided PICC line.  The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the
 line projects over the inflow tract of the right atrium.  There is no evidence
 of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
 
 The pre-existing pneumonia on the right is mildly increased in severity. 
 There also is an obvious increase in severity in the left lung, given that
 similar opacities that on the right are now widespread in the lingula and,
 probably, in the left lower lobe.  Mild retrocardiac atelectasis.  Unchanged
 size of the cardiac silhouette.
