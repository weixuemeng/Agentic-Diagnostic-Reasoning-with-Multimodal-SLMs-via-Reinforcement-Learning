                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with MM and amyloidosis p/w fever, cough, and diarrhea for
 the past four days. Eval for pneumonia  // ___F with MM and amyloidosis p/w
 fever, cough, and diarrhea for the past four days. Eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___ and CT chest from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  Multiple new, poorly defined, sub cm nodules are
 seen in the bilateral upper lobes, which could represent atypical pneumonia in
 the right clinical setting.  Bilateral peribronchial cuffing is present in the
 perihilar regions.  Minimal bibasilar interstitial opacities have improved
 since ___.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multiple sub cm nodules in the bilateral upper lobes, which could represent an
 atypical pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Follow-up radiographs
 should be obtained after treatment to assess for resolution and to exclude
 amyloid involvement of the lungs.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend follow-up radiographs after treatment of
 presumed pneumonia to assess for resolution.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Updated findings from original wet read were communicated to
 Dr. ___ at 3:57 p.m. on ___ by phone.
