 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:17 PM
  RLL opacity is more dense than at 11:53am, which may be due to technique or
  worsening pneumonia. No new opacity. Pulmonary vasculature is less distinct
  than at 11:53, suggesting vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
  No pneumothorax or effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 6:02 P.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma in a ___-year-old woman who had an auto stem cell
 transplant in ___ and amyloidosis.  Admitted with pneumonia.  Increasing
 shortness of breath after intravenous fluid administration.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___ at 11:53 a.m.
 
 There are no findings to suggest volume overload, specifically no mediastinal
 or pulmonary vascular congestion or change in normal heart size.  There are
 septal lines in the right lower lung that are thicker now than they were
 earlier, but there has also been a substantial increase in heterogeneous
 consolidation in that region.  I would attribute the increased septal
 thickening to limited, local edema or hemorrhage secondary to worsening
 pneumonia or spontaneous bleeding in the lung.
