                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  Per
 radiology technologist, the exam was done supine as the patient was
 uncooperative.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The patient is rotated to the left.  The calcified
 mediastinal lymph nodes are again noted.  The cardiac silhouette is not
 enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Apparent mild elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragm may relate to patient positioning.
