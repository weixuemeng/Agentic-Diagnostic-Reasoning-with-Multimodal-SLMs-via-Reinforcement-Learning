                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 5:57
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right pneumothorax status post chest
 tube.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 5:25.
 
 Portable erect chest film ___ at 5:58 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There continues to be extensive subcutaneous emphysema bilaterally.  A
 right chest tube remains in place and there are multiple right posterior
 lateral rib fractures.  There is at least a small right apical lateral
 pneumothorax.  On the left, no obvious pneumothorax is seen although it is
 somewhat difficult given the extensive overlying subcutaneous emphysema.  The
 previously described left-sided multiple rib fractures are less apparent on
 the current study due to differences in positioning.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  No pulmonary edema.
