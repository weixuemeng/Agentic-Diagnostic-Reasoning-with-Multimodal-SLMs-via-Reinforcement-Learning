                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pneumothorax and chest tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.4 cm above the level of
 the carina.  An enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm, coiled
 in the expected location of the stomach, portion not included on the image.  A
 right-sided chest tube is seen projecting over the mediastinum.  There is
 diffuse, extensive subcutaneous emphysema bilaterally throughout the thorax. 
 Numerous rib fractures are seen, particularly on the right, which are
 displaced.  It is difficult to exclude left-sided rib fractures.  Known
 right-sided pneumothorax is difficult to identify.  No large pleural effusion
 is seen.  There is prominence of the right hilum, which could be due to
 underlying consolidation/contusion.  However, underlying atelectasis from
 pneumothorax is not excluded.  There are also subtle opacities projecting over
 the left lung base as well.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Distal aspect of the right chest tube courses to the midline and projects
 over the lower mediastinum/superior cardiac silhouettes.  Given single frontal
 image, difficult to assess whether anterior or posterior in location; however,
 recommend withdrawal.  This finding was discussed with Dr. ___ at
 6:20 p.m. on ___ via telephone, 3 minutes after discovery.
 2.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema diffusely throughout the thorax. 
 Numerous rib fractures, particularly on the right, which are displaced. 
 Possible underlying pleural hematoma.
 3.  Concern for pulmonary contusions.
