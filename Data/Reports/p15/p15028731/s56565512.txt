                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right flail chest status post chest tube removal, assess for
 interval change.  
 
 COMPARISON:  All available chest x-rays from ___ to ___.
 Reference chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate a stable right apical
 pneumothorax.  The lateral hydropneumothorax while still present, has improved
 compared to CXR from earlier in the morning. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema
 also appears mildly improved.  There is a small right pleural effusion.  An
 opacity at the right lower lung is worse, and likely represents atelectasis. 
 There is no change to the left lung parenchyma.  Multiple rib fractures are
 again noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Persistent right apical pneumothorax with improvement of right lateral
 basilar hydropneumothorax.
 
 2.  Increased right lower lobe opacification, which likely represents
 worsening atelectasis.
