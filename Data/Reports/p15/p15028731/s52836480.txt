                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of COPD status post fall with bilateral rib fractures and
 right pneumothorax, evaluation for interval change. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies with the most recent chest radiograph from
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Overall, there is very little interval change in comparison to the prior study
 from the day before.  Endotracheal tube appears in place in the mid trachea. 
 Chest tube appears in place on the right impinging on the mediastinum. 
 Enteric tube traverses to the stomach.  
 
 Again noted is massive air collection in the soft tissues causing multiple
 horizontal lines which overly the entire thorax and any potential pneumothorax
 would be very difficult to diagnose.  Within these limitations, there is no
 evidence of a definite persisting right pneumothorax. The previously noted
 pneumomediastinum has continued to decrease from ___. 
 
 There is no change in appearance of the lung parenchyma or the hemidiaphragms.
 Multiple bilateral rib fractures are again noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Little change in comparison to prior study with stable supporting structures
 and subcutaneous air. Evaluation for the right pneumothorax is limited but no
 definite pneumothorax is identified. The known pneumomediastinum has continued
 to decrease.
