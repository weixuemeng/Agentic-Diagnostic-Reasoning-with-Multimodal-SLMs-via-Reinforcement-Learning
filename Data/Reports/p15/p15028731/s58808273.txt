                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right-sided pneumothorax status post chest tube, history of
 bilateral rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, the most recent chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided chest tube is noted and slightly pulled back in comparison to the
 prior study.  Right-sided pneumothorax is again noted at the superior and
 inferiolateral portions of the right lung.
 
 Again noted is massive air collection in the soft tissues causing multiple
 horizontal lines which overlie the entire thorax.  Previously noted
 pneumomediastinum appears stable.  There is no change in the appearance of the
 left lung parenchyma.  Multiple bilateral rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Small persistent right pneumothorax again noted along with
 extensive subcutaneous air.
