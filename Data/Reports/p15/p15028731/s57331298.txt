                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right pneumothorax and right chest tube, here to evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube, enteric tube and right chest tube are
 unchanged in position.  There is diffuse subcutaneous emphysema across the
 thorax extending into the lower neck bilaterally.  The soft tissue air
 collections obscure the lungs so that any pneumothorax is not clearly
 visualized.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Rib fractures are better evaluated on CT of ___.
