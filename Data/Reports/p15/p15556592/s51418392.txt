                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Seizure.  Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is rotated to the right, somewhat limiting evaluation.
 The lungs are normally expanded without focal airspace opacity. There is
 atalectasis at the left base.  There is scarring or thickening of the pleura
 along the lateral right hemithorax.  The heart is top normal. Appearance of
 the mediastinum likely reflects patient rotation, and is likely normal.  There
 is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Top normal heart and mild atalectasis at the left base but no
 convincing evidence of pneumonia.
