                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ALL, status post bone marrow transplant, left lung transplant,
 recurrent pneumonias.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the endotracheal
 tube is now projecting approximately 5.6 cm above the carina.  The tube could
 be advanced by approximately 1-2 cm.
 
 The course of the bilateral central venous access lines is unchanged.  Also
 unchanged is the severity and distribution of the bilateral parenchymal
 opacities, very extensive on the left and more subtle on the right, as well as
 the consolidation with air bronchograms at the right lung apex.  No new
 parenchymal opacity.  The stent in the left tracheal system is in constant
 position.
