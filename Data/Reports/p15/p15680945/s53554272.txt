                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and prior lung transplant, assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The left lung is well expanded with minimal linear left basal
 opacity most likely due to atelectasis or scarring, unchanged from prior
 studies.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the distal SVC.  Persistent
 right apical pleural thickening and scarring with volume loss is unchanged
 with persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Gastrostomy tube and
 surgical clips are seen in the upper abdomen.  The cardiac size and silhouette
 is unchanged.  Left bronchial stent is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Unchanged chronic pulmonary opacities without acute process.
