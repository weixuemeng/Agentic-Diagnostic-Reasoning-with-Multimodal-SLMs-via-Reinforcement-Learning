 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are mildly hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is

 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacity in the right upper lung zone, which has increased
 in size since the prior exam.  Given the underlying COPD, recommend further
 characterization with a non-emergent CT of the chest to exclude malignancy.
