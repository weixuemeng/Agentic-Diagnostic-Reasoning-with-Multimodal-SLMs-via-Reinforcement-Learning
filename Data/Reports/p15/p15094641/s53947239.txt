                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of pericarditis and chest
 pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are low lung volumes.  Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle could be
 due to pleural effusion.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is
 mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 could be due to overlying soft tissue or trace pleural effusion.  Mild central
 pulmonary vascular engorgement; prominence of the vasculature may be
 accentuated by low lung volumes.
