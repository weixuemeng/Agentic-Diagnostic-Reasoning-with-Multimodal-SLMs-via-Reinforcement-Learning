  Compared to radiograph obtained 6 hours earlier, there is interval development
  of bilateral diffuse, though predominantly perihilar, opacifications with more
  confluent opacification in the right lower lung.  Given rapidity of
  development as well as mild interval enlargement of the cardiomediastinal
  silhouette (including a engorged azygos vein), findings likely represent
  pulmonary edema.  Right lower lung opacification may represent asymmetric
  edema though cannot exclude aspiration and/or atelectasis.  No definite
  pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Crackles on lung examination.  Question pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.  This is earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: The heart size is borderline.  There is a new moderate interstitial
 abnormality with perihilar hazy opacification and indistinct pulmonary
 vessels, most suggestive of interstitial pulmonary edema.  This appearance
 includes a relatively confluent area of right infrahilar opacification.  There
 is no clear evidence for pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with onset of moderate interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  Relatively focal area of new opacification in the right lower lung
 could be explained by asymmetric edema, but followup radiographs are suggested
 to exclude an underlying second developing process such as pneumonia or
 aspiration.
