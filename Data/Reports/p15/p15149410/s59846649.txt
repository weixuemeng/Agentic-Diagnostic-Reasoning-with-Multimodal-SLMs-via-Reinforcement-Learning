                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with CABG, followup
 effusions.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable.  Heart size and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  Small amount of left pleural effusion as well as
 minimal amount of right pleural effusion are noted associated with bibasal
 atelectasis.  There is suspected minimal amount of right apical pneumothorax
 as well as left apical pneumothorax, although it might reflect lucency of the
 lungs unrelated to pneumothorax and should be further followed with chest
 radiographs.
