 The lungs are well inflated and clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar
 contours, and pleural surfaces are normal. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No definite rib fracture is identified, but dedicated rib
 radiographs would be more sensitive and may be considered if there remains
 strong clinical suspicion for rib fracture.
