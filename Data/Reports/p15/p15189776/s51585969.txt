                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after TACE, with fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is interval development of bibasal opacities, more pronounced than on
 the prior study.  Although they might reflect interstitial process of known
 infectious character, given patient findings, bibasilar infectious process or
 potentially aspiration is the most likely possibility.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.
