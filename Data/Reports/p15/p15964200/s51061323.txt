  Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Increased
  prominence of the mediastinum most likely relates to lower lung volumes
  however, if there is high clinical concern for acute mediastinal process,
  chest CT is more sensitive and should be considered.
  
  Subtle left mid to lower lung opacity may be due to atelectasis, aspiration,
  or subtle infection.

 Non-verbal at baseline.  // eval for ICH, c-spine fx, pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Increased prominence of the mediastinum most likely relates to lower lung
 volumes however, if there is clinical concern for acute mediastinal process,
 chest CT is more sensitive and should be considered.  Subtle left mid to lower
 lung opacity may be due to atelectasis, aspiration, or subtle infection.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.  Cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal.  .
 
 IMPRESSION:
