                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lesion seen on CAT scan in right lower lobe.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous plain radiographs.  The nodular opacification at the
 right base medially seen on the scout radiograph and CT is again suggested on
 the frontal view.  It is somewhat difficult to appreciate on the lateral
 projection, but appears to be at the mid chest level.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but there is no evidence of vascular
 congestion or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nodular density at the right base medially, not as well seen as
 on CT.
