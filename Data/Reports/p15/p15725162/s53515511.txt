                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post maze, evaluate post-operative changes.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, the appearance is
 similar to the film obtained at 12:03 p.m. the same day.  Lines and tubes are
 unchanged, in satisfactory position.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation is present, likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  Prominence
 of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature is also likely
 accentuated by low lung volumes.  No pneumothorax detected.
