                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Maze, evaluate pleural effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray at 14:33 p.m.
 
 Right IJ central line tip overlies the SVC/RA junction, unchanged.  Metallic
 structure overlies left heart border, ? outside of patient, unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Again seen are low inspiratory volumes, with patchy opacity in the right
 cardiophrenic region and increased retrocardiac density.  
 
 Compared to the prior study, the right pleural effusion is more apparent and
 there is new minimal atelectasis at the right lung base in the mid-axillary
 line.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
