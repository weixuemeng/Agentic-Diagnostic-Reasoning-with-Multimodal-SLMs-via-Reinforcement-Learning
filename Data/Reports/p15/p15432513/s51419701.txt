                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  High-speed motor vehicle collision.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged, taking into account
 low lung volumes, which accentuates the heart size and pulmonary vasculature. 
 The mediastinum is widened.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are
 clear.  Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Widened mediastinum may be secondary to fat deposition, but given the
 mechanism of injury, aortic injury is not excluded and further evaluation with
 CT is warranted.
 2.  No definite fracture.
