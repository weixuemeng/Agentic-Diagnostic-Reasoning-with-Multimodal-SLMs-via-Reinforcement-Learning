                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with a history of seizure d/o, advanced dementia who presents
 after a seizure found to have RLL PNA and TME with lactic acidosis, hypoxia,
 and respiratory failure.  // Evaluate for pneumonia    Evaluate for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 04:21
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 15:35 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube, right subclavian PICC line, and nasogastric tube are
 unchanged in position.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. 
 No pulmonary edema.  Right lung is grossly clear.  Retrocardiac consolidation
 persists with adjacent layering left effusion.  Findings would be consistent
 with partial lower lobe compressive atelectasis, although superimposed
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to
 detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi erect technique.
