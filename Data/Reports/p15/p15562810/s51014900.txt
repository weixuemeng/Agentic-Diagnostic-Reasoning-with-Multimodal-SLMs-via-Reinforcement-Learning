 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MI, volume overload, ? OF vap  // worsening
 pulm edema?      worsening pulm edema?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are stable.  There are lower lung volumes.  Continued enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications
 consistent with the clinical diagnosis of volume overload.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia or even ARDS could be considered.
 The hemidiaphragms are poorly seen with hazy opacification at the bases,
 consistent with layering pleural effusion and volume loss in the lower lobes,
 especially on the left.
