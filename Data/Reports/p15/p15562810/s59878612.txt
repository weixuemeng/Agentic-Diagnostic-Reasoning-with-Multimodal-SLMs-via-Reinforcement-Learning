 for ARDS and pneumonia.  // Please evaluate for interval change.     Please
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  There has been substantial clearing of the bilateral
 airspace opacities, which most likely represented pulmonary edema, though
 widespread pneumonia and ARDS could be considered.  The left hemidiaphragm
 again is poorly seen, consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the
 left lower lobe.
