                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with generalized weakness  // Infiltrate, edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains mildly tortuous with atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the knob.  Mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  Lungs are hyperinflated.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Scarring within the lung apices is similar.  Mild bronchiectasis is again
 noted within the lung bases, better appreciated on the previous CT.  New
 bibasilar patchy opacities are demonstrated along with increased small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Mild to moderate
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased small bilateral pleural effusions with patchy bibasilar airspace
 opacities which may be due to infection.
