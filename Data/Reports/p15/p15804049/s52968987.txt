                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fevers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen pelvis ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There
 is mild calcification of the aortic knob.  The pulmonary vascularity is not
 engorged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent lower lobe streaky
 opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  There is evidence of prior kyphoplasty of a vertebral body at the
 thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
