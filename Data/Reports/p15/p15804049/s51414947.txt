 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Shortness of breath, palpitation, fever,
 pancreaticoduodenectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  There are lower lung volumes.  Bilateral small
 effusions larger on the left side are grossly unchanged.  Bibasilar
 atelectases have minimally increased on the right.  There are lower lung
 volumes.  NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.  There is no evident
 pneumothorax.  Right perihilar opacities have increased.  This could be
 atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
