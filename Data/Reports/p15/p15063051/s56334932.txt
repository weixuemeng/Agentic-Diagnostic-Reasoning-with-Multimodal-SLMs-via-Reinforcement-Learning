                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The heart is normal in size and the lungs are
 clear without vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  Of incidental note is
 a minimal impression on the lower right side of the cervical trachea, raising
 the possibility of a thyroid mass.
