                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pleuritic right-sided chest pain versus right upper quadrant
 pain, now with productive cough.  Please assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate persistent but
 improved left lower lobe opacification and decreased very small pleural
 effusion.  A newly evident right lower lobe opacification with small pleural
 effusion is noted, better appreciated on the lateral view.  Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged.  Osseous abnormalities are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent but improved left lower lobe opacification and very
 small effusion. Newly appreciated right lower lobe opacification with small
 adjacent pleural effusion. Overall, process is predominantly rightsided,
 though consideration should be given to multifocal pneumonia.
