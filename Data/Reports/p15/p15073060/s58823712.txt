                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 9:07 A.M. 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with stage IV lung cancer, followup after
 pleurodesis.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___.
 
 Portable AP of right chest film on ___ at 9:07 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right basilar chest tube remains in place.  There is blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle as well as thickening of the right lateral pleura, which
 may be related to the patient's known pleurodesis and/or residual effusion. 
 No pneumothorax is appreciated.  Streaky linear opacities at the left base may
 represent subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  Opacity at the right base may
 reflect atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  The
 upper right lung and the remainder of the left lung are clear.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
