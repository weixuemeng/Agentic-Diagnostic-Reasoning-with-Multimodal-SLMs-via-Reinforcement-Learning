                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of effusion, status post PleurX placement, recurrence of
 pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the right
 pleural effusion has moderately decreased.  The remaining effusion is still
 obliterating the contour of the right hemidiaphragm in part, and the right
 costophrenic sinus.  Atelectases at the lung bases are also improved, but not
 completely resolved.  A pleural drain remains in situ, but the drain has been
 pulled back.  The left lung is unremarkable.
