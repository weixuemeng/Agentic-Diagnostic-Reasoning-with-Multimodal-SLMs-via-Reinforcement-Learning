                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left-sided chest pain.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax or infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 rib fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No rib fractures identified. 
 Of note, this study has suboptimal sensitivity for the detection of rib
 fractures.  If there is high clinical concern, a rib series should be
 obtained.
