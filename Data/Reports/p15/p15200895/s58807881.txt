                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of CHF/COPD with dyspnea.
 Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Available for comparison is a preceding chest
 examination dated ___, issued by the ___ emergency
 room.
 
 On present examination, significant cardiac enlargement is seen.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is markedly congested bilaterally with prominent
 perivascular haze in the pulmonary circulation.  The lateral bases are
 obscured, so are the diaphragmatic contours compatible with bilateral pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax can be identified in the apical area.
 
 In comparison with the next previous examination obtained one earlier, the
 pulmonary congestive pattern has markedly increased and the same is too for
 the bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Advanced CHF with bilateral pleural effusions and beginning
 central pulmonary edema.
