                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea on exertion, fatigue.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the frontal view, there is an apparent focal left base opacity,
 which may represent overlap of structures and is not well seen on the lateral
 view; however, a small focus of infection is not excluded.  The right lung is
 clear.  There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle left base opacity may be due to overlap of structures;
 however, a small focus of infection is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
