                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hiatal hernia repair, to assess subcutaneous emphysema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been a substantial
 decrease in the left subcutaneous emphysema, though a moderate amount of gas
 persists.  Continued opacification at the left base consistent with pleural
 effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Again there is mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.
