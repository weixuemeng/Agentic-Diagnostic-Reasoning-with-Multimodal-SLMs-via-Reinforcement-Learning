                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hiatal hernia repair, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is extensive subcutaneous
 gas along the left lateral chest wall.  No convincing evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Surgical changes are seen at the left base with volume loss in
 the lower lobe.  What appears to be gas projected over the stomach may reflect
 some residual hiatal hernia.
