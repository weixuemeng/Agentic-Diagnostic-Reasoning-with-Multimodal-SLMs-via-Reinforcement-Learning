                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 12:07.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with metastatic gastric cancer, right lower
 lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray last week.  Evaluate for evolution.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 12:07 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Since the previous study, there has been interval appearance of layering
 moderate-sized right pleural effusion with associated airspace consolidation
 in the right lower lobe, which would be concerning for pneumonia.  In
 addition, there is a 7-mm nodular opacity projecting along the inferior aspect
 of the right fifth posterolateral rib and a second 7-mm nodular opacity, which
 projects over the third left anterior rib.  As these were not appreciated on
 the most recent study of ___, these would less likely represent
 metastatic disease given the short timeframe, but could represent septic
 emboli, focal hemorrhage, or be external to the patient.  These can be
 reassessed on followup imaging and if they persist, cross-sectional imaging
 may be helpful.  Catheters are again seen overlying the right upper abdomen. 
 No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  With the exception of the right heart
 border, the cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
