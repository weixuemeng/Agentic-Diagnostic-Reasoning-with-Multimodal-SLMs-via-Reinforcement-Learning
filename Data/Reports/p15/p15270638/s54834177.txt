                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___,
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, which results in bronchovascular crowding.  Positioning
 of the patient is somewhat suboptimal.  Increased interstitial markings and
 indistinctness of the hila is consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  Cardiac silhouette appears grossly unchanged.  A large hiatus hernia
 noted.  No pneumothorax or consolidation.  Wedge compression fractures of T8
 and T9, unchanged compared to the prior radiographs from ___. 
 ___ deformity at L1, unchanged compared to a prior lumbar spine
 radiograph from ___.  Compression fracture at L3, unchanged
 compared to the prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, although this may be exaggerated by low
 lung volumes.
 
 Multiple compression deformities in the thoracic and lumbar spine appear
 unchanged compared to prior studies.
