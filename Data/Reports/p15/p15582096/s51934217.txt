                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  On lateral
 view, posterior opacity is seen projecting just above the level of the
 diaphragm, raising concern for consolidation which could be due to infection. 
 This is not as well seen on the frontal view but may be in the medial right
 lung base.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings raise concern for early/evolving lower lobe pneumonia.
