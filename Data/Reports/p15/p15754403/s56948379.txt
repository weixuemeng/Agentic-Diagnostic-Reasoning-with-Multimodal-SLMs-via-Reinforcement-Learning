 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.

 nodular density is present at the right base measuring 1.8 x 1.6 cm in
 diameter without a clear correlate on the lateral view.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Right base lung nodule; CT may be considered non-emergently for further
 characterization.
