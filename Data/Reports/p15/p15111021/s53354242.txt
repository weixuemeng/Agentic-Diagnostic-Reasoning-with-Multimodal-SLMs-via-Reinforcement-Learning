                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hemoptysis with laryngeal cancer
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are patchy opacities in the right mid and lower lung zones. These
 are stable.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is a nodular
 opacity overlying the left sixth anterior rib as before.  A tracheostomy tube
 is in place.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Patchy opacities in the right mid and lower lung zones are unchanged likely
 reflecting pneumonia.
 
 2.  Nodular opacity in the left lower lung zone which could reflect a nipple
 shadow or a nodule. Repeat radiograph should be performed with nipple markers.
