                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 2:48 P.M., ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with hypotension, possible consolidation in the
 right lower lobe yesterday, now after fluid resuscitation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 1:29 p.m.:
 
 Lung volumes have improved, and the region of right infrahilar consolidation
 is less prominent suggesting it is largely atelectasis.  Remainder of the
 lungs entirely clear.  Heart size normal.  No pleural effusion.  Right jugular
 line ends centrally.  Mild mediastinal widening is probably a combination of
 mediastinal fat deposition and venous engorgement.
