                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with  status post  EGD.  Evaluate for perforation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable without
 evidence of pneumomediastinum.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Ill-defined nodular opacities are again seen within the left upper lobe, right
 upper lobe, and both lower lobes, slightly improved in the interval, and
 likely reflective of improving multifocal pneumonia/aspiration.  No new focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No findings to suggest esophageal perforation including no pneumomediastinum
 or pleural effusions.  Interval improvement in multifocal ill-defined nodular
 opacities in both lungs, likely reflective of improving multifocal pneumonia/
 aspiration.
