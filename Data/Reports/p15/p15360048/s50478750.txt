                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chest tube  // chest tube
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same-day chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with chest radiographs from earlier this morning, there has been
 minimal improvement of a small left apicolateral pneumothorax with slight
 change position of left pleural pigtail catheter, more superior in position
 compared to prior study.  In addition, there has been interval development of
 right lower lobe collapse.  Right pleural effusion has increased in size and a
 small left pleural effusion has developed, with evidence of layering
 bilaterally.  Asymmetric heterogeneous pulmonary opacities, left greater than
 right, have not significantly changed.  Endotracheal tube is partially
 visualized and terminates approximately ___.5 cm above the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent small left apicolateral pneumothorax with left pleural pigtail
 catheter in slightly more superior position compared to prior study.
 2. Right lower lobe collapse, new since prior study.
 3. Interval worsening of right pleural effusion with newly developed left
 pleural effusion, with evidence of layering bilaterally.
 4. Unchanged asymmetric left greater than right heterogeneous pulmonary
 opacities.
