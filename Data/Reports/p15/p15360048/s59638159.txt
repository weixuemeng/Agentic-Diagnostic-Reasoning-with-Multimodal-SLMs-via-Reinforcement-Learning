                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with leukocytosis, abdominal pain  // acute cardiopulmonary
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrate new left lower lung air space
 nodular opacities as well as nodular opacities within the left upper lung
 zone.  Scattered opacities within the right upper lobe peripherally are
 additionally noted with worsening areas in the right midlung.  Some areas in
 the left upper lung have demonstrated interval improvement.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged and within normal limits.  There is no evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  An apparent probable esophageal stent is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Ill-defined nodular opacities most conspicuous within the left lower lobe are
 new relative to prior study dated ___, worrisome early multifocal
 consolidations.
