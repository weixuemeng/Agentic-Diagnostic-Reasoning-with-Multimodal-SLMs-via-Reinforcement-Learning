                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with SOB for 24hrs.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable, allowing for technique. The hila are mildly prominent. There is
 no pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely. The lungs are
 well-expanded with increased number and indistinctness of interstitial
 markings, consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  Increased opacity at the left
 base may reflect atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with probable small bilateral pleural effusions. Mild
 cardiomegaly.  Left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis.
