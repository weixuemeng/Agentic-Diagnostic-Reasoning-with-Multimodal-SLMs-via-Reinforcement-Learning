                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is difficult to assess due to
 the presence of left basilar opacity which may reflect atelectasis but
 infection cannot be excluded.  There is mild elevation of left hemidiaphragm
 which appears chronic.  Small left pleural effusion may be present.  There is
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Old right
 clavicular and old left rib fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis, but infection
 cannot be excluded. Elevated left hemidiaphragm.  Probable small left pleural
 effusion.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
