                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recent AAA repair presents with coffee ground
 emesis, constipation and syncope
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is again
 demonstrated.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is present with mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement, but this is improved compared to the previous exam.  Increased
 interstitial opacities are most pronounced at the lung bases, likely
 reflective of chronic interstitial abnormality with associated atelectasis. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions may be present.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  Multiple bilateral rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial opacities at the lung bases may reflect chronic
 interstitial abnormality with atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, slightly improved from the previous study, with probable trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.
