                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with history of clear cell renal cell cancer with metastatic
 disease to the chest, new shortness of breath, assess for metastatic burden
 versus acute abnormality.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Midline sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal clips are noted.  There is a nodular opacity projecting over the
 right lung base measuring 2.8 x 2.4 cm.  There was a small nodule seen in this
 site on the prior PET-CT and findings are concerning for enlarging pulmonary
 nodule.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear without evidence of pneumoni,
 edema, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 grossly unremarkable.  The imaged bony structures are intact.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary nodule in the right lower lung measuring up to 2.8 cm appears
 increased in size from PET-CT and remains concerning for metastatic disease.
 Additional smaller nodules seen on prior PET-CT cannot be clearly visualized
 though if needed a CT may be performed to further assess.
