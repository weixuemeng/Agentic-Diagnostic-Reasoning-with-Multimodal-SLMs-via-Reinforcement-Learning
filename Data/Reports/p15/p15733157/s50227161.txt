                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p AVR/MVR  // eval effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:08
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube, NG tube, and Swan-Ganz catheter have been removed.  A right sided
 PICC line is again seen, tip over distal SVC, near cavoatrial junction.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 Again seen are sternotomy wires, with moderately severe cardiomegaly, similar
 to the prior study.  There is vascular plethora and diffuse vascular blurring,
 consistent with CHF.  This is probably similar in appearance.
 
 There are small to moderate bilateral effusions with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.  Compared to ___, the right effusion is
 probably larger, with a small amount of fluid now seen within the minor
 fissure.
 
 Again noted is a surgical clip overlying the right lung base -- this may or
 may not relate to the chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Marked cardiomegaly, with CHF and mild interstitial edema, probably
 unchanged.
 2. Bilateral effusions, with underlying bibasilar collapse and/or
 consolidation.  The right effusion is larger compared with ___.
 3. Lines and tubes as described.
