                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with junky cough and DOE  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC is no longer visualized.  Moderate right-sided pleural effusion is
 again noted.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  Irregular interstitial
 markings seen in the right lung and at the left lung base.  While these may be
 in part due to chronic underlying COPD, possibility of superimposed
 interstitial edema is possible.  Surgical chain sutures project over the right
 mid lung.  Focal nodular opacities projecting over the lung bases likely to
 represent nipple shadows.  There is apparent increase in size of the cardiac
 silhouette particularly along the right.  This could be due to medially
 loculated effusion but incompletely characterized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic underlying changes in the lungs suggesting COPD with possible
 superimposed interstitial edema in the right lung and left lung base.
 Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
 New opacity at the right lung base medially could be due to loculated effusion
 medially.
