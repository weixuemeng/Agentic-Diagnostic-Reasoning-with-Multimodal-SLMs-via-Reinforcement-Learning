                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary hypertension and emphysema  //
 increased dyspnea, eval for change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 Chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to chest radiograph from ___, increased coarseness of
 interstitial markings at the bases bilaterally is concerning for interstitial
 lung disease.  Opacification along the right lateral chest may represent
 pleural involvement.
 Again noted is previous wedge resection in the right upper lobe with adjacent
 scarring.  Severe emphysema with reduced lung markings at the apices,
 hyperinflation, and flattening of the diaphragms noted.
 Nodular opacity between the right eighth and ninth posterior ribs likely
 corresponds to right nipple shadow better seen on the lateral view.
 Very small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present. No evidence of
 pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar coarse interstitial markings concerning for interstitial lung
 disease.  Opacification along the right lateral chest may represent pleural
 involvement.  Recommend chest CT for further evaluation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
