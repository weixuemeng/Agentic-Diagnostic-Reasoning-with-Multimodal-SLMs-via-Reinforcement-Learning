                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with right internal jugular central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:26
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the low SVC. 
 No pneumothorax is identified.  Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately
 3 cm from the carina, however, the balloon appears to be somewhat
 overinflated.  The enteric tube tip again remains suboptimally positioned in
 the distal esophagus.  Low lung volumes persists.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  Persistent bibasilar opacities likely reflective of
 atelectasis are noted.  No pleural effusion is present.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the low SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
 2. Endotracheal tube balloon appears to be overinflated.
 3. Enteric tube tip remains suboptimally positioned within the distal
 esophagus.
 4. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
