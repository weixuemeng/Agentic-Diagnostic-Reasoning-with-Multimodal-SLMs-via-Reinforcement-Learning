                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubated, confirm endotracheal tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position, terminating approximately 3.4
 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube tip is suboptimally position, with tip in
 the distal esophagus.  Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac silhouette size remains
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Patchy atelectasis is noted in the lung bases.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 2. Enteric tube tip suboptimally position within the distal esophagus, and
 should be advanced by at least 10 cm for appropriate positioning.
 3. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
