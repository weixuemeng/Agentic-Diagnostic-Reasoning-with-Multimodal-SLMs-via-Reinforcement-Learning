                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute cholecystitis  // please evaluate
 for et tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 3.7 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube
 terminates just distal to the GE junction and should be advanced 5-6 cm for
 ideal positioning.  A right internal jugular catheter is in unchanged position
 and terminates in the distal SVC.
 
 The lung volumes are markedly low.  Bibasilar opacities, left greater than
 right likely reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enteric tube terminates just distal to the GE junction and should be advanced
 5-6 cm for ideal positioning.  No significant change from earlier this
 morning.
