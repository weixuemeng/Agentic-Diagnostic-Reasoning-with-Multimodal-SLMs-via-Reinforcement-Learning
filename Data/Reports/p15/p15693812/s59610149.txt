                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with complex cardiac history, recent line placed for
 CRRT, status post PEA arrest and CPR.  Evaluate for line placement,
 pneumothorax, or rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine chest radiograph shows no pneumothorax or acute rib
 fractures, but note that the left costophrenic angle and lateral lower left
 ribs are not included in the view of the film.  Supporting lines and tubes
 including endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, femorally placed Swan-Ganz
 catheter, and right IJ CRRT catheter are in relatively unchanged positions. 
 Bihilar consolidation is also unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No change in positioning of supporting lines and tubes and no
 visible pneumothorax or rib fracture.  Note, exclusion of left lateral lower
 chest.
