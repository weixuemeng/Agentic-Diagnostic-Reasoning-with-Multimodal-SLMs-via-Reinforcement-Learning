                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Diastolic CHF and shortness of breath, status post diuresis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has resolved.  Large right and small left pleural
 effusions have minimally improved on the left allowing the difference in
 positioning of the patient.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no
 evident pneumothorax.  Sternal wires are aligned.
