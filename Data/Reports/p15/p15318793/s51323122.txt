 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a mild progression of the
 pre-existing bilateral basal predominantly interstitial parenchymal opacities.

 but cannot be completely excluded.  Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette with mild elongation of the descending aorta.  No pleural
 effusions.
