                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Known hemothorax with worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs and CT studies from earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  A small right
 apical pneumothorax appears unchanged. A small right-sided pleural effusion is
 not well assessed, being largely subpulmonic.  Streaky right lower lung
 opacification suggests atelectasis, similar to findings on the recent prior
 chest CT.  However, more diffuse opacification has improved since the prior
 radiographs. Non-displaced fractures of the right posterior fourth and fifth
 ribs are visible.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improvement in vague widespread opacification, probably improving pulmonary
 edema.  Stable small right-sided pneumothorax.  Persistent opacity at the
 right lung base, probably compatible with atelectasis, although aspiration is
 not excluded as a possible alternative etiology.
