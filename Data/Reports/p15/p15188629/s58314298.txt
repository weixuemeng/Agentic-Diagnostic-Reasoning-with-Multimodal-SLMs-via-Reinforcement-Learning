 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette was mild elevation pulmonary venous pressure in the
 substantial right pleural effusion with volume loss in the right lower lung.
 With the change in position, the aortic 0 pulmonary window is probably within
 normal limits. Similarly, the right paramediastinal opacification on the
 previous study is much less seen on the current study and could well represent
 tortuosity of brachiocephalic vessels.
