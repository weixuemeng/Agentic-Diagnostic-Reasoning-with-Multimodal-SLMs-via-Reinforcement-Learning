                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pneumothorax or hemothorax  s/p fall  //
 evidence of worsening pneumothorax or hemothorax - please perform standing PA
 exiratory CXR
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Redemonstrated is a small right apical pneumothorax measuring up to 1.4 cm
 vertical diameter stable from the prior exam.  Mild pulmonary edema is new and
 moderate cardiomegaly has increased Right lower lobe atelectasis is noted.
 Small right pleural effusion is stable.  Interval increase in fullness along
 the inferior aspect of the aortic arch is likely secondary to patient
 positioning, but warrants attention on follow up.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Stable, 1.4 cm right apical pneumothorax and small dependent pleural
 effusion.
 2. Interval worsening of moderate cardiomegaly accompanies new mild pulmonary
 edema.
 3. Increased opacity within the aorticopulmonary window. Findings are likely
 secondary to differences in patient positioning, but repeat chest radiographs
 are recommended to document the stability of this finding.
