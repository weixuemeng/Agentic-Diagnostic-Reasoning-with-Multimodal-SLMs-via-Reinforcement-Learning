                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with aortic root aneurysm,
 mechanical aortic valve with chest pain, hypertension, and new ST depression.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Heart size and mediastinum are grossly
 unchanged since the prior study.  There is new left retrocardiac consolidation
 that might be consistent with aspiration/infection.  Right basal opacity
 appears to be new as well and might potentially represent similar in origin. 
 Right PICC line tip is not clearly seen beyond the level of mid portion of
 right brachiocephalic vein.
