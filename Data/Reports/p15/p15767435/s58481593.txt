 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with recurrent bladder
 cancer after radical cystoprostatectomy with ileal conduit and urinary
 diversion complicated by atrial fibrillation.  Assessment of NG tube
 placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___

 Currently, the NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged including cardiomegaly.  Replaced aortic valve is redemonstrated. 
 Left retrocardiac opacity is unchanged since recent prior radiograph but there
 is interval improvement in interstitial pulmonary edema.  Minimal pleural
 effusion cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.
