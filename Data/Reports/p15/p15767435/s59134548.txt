                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post redo sternotomy.  Evaluate for effusions or
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest again demonstrate
 median sternotomy wires and surgical clips.  There has been interval
 improvement in the right basilar pleural effusion and atelectasis with
 continued small to moderate left pleural effusion.  The remainder of the lung
 parenchyma is clear with no focal consolidation.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged but stable since the prior radiographs. Aortic valve replacement is
 again seen.  Kyphosis of the thoracic spine is noted and unchanged since prior
 radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement of right basilar opacity.  Persistent
 bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
