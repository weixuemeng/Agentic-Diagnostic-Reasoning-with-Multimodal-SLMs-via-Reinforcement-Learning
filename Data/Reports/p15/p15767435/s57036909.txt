                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of atrial fibrillation
 status post radical cystectomy, evaluate for pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright sitting position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination ___ ___. 
 High positioned diaphragms are explained by the patient's recent abdominal
 surgical intervention.  Bilateral small amount of subdiaphragmatic air is
 present.  Moderate cardiac enlargement is present and there is status post
 sternotomy, apparently related to previous aortic valve replacement with
 metallic prosthesis noted within the heart shadow.  Aortic appearance
 unaltered.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  The lateral pleural
 sinuses are free and thus there is no evidence of pleural effusion on this
 portable examination.  No pneumothorax is identified in the apical area. 
 Possibly present small amounts of pleural effusion could be expected in the
 posterior pleural sinuses, but cannot be identified on this single AP chest
 view.
