 HISTORY:  SBO status post NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Two portable AP chest radiographs were obtained.  An NG tube has been
 inserted.  The tip is below the diaphragm and loops upwards towards the cardia
 of the stomach.  A prominent air-fluid level is visualized in the stomach. 
 Several loops of dilated small bowel measure up to 7 cm in diameter.  The lung
 volumes are low, accentuating the pulmonary vasculature.  Retrocardiac
 atelectasis is noted.  Cardiomegaly is moderate.  Mediastinal wires are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 NG tube below the diaphragm in the expected position of the stomach.  Dilated
 small bowel better seen on accompanying abdominal films.
