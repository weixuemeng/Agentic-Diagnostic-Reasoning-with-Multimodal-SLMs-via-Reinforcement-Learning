 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post radical cystectomy, evaluation for bleeding.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain
 low.  The previous minimal right pleural effusion has resolved, but areas of
 atelectasis are still seen at both lung bases.  No other newly appeared
 parenchymal opacities.  Mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.  Sternal
 wires and right PICC line are unchanged.
