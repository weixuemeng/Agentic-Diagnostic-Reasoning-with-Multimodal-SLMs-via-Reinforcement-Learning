 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable.  There are persistent low lung
 volumes.  Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side, consistent with
 atelectasis and effusions have markedly improved.  Left PICC tip is at the
 cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax.  Vascular congestion has
 resolved.
