 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Tachypnea, shortness of breath, recent volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain
 low.  The pre-existing right small pleural effusion has decreased in extent. 
 Also decreased are the signs indicative of pulmonary edema.  Bilateral areas
 of basal atelectasis persist and the cardiac silhouette continues to be
 enlarged.  The possibility of pericardial effusion could be considered.
 
 Unchanged course and position of the left PICC line.  Unchanged alignment of
 the sternal wires.
