                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the hemidiaphragms are less
 sharply seen with increased opacification at the left base.  Findings are
 consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the lower lobes in a patient
 with low lung volumes.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
 
 No evidence of vascular congestion or abnormality involving the upper zones.
