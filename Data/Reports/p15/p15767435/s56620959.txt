                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:27 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after AVR.  Evaluate for complications.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Substantial worsening right lower lobe atelectasis and increasing moderate
 right pleural effusion.  Left lower lobe still collapsed, no change in small
 accompanying left pleural effusion.  Mild interval increase in caliber of the
 cardiac silhouette could be due to enlarging heart size or accumulation of
 pericardial fluid, but there is no distention of mediastinal veins to suggest
 hemodynamically significant effect.  No pneumothorax.
