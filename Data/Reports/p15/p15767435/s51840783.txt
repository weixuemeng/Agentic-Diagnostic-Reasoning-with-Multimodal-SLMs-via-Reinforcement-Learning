 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:26 PM
  Opacities at both bases are unchanged from the prior exam, and most consistent
  with atelectasis.  In the proper clinical setting, could be a pneumonia or
  aspiration.  There are no new parenchymal opacities.  PICC and sternal wires
  are stable.  Prominent air filled loop of colon in the left upper quadrant
  overlapping with stomach gas bubble is also not significantly changed from the
  prior exam.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post radical cystectomy, low-grade fever, rule out infection.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Possible background COPD.  The patient is
 status post sternotomy, with prosthetic valve.  There is probable
 cardiomegaly, though this is likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. 
 There are focal opacities at both bases medially consistent with collapse
 and/or consolidation.  Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles is
 present.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 10:30 a.m., the basilar opacities are similar, as is
 the small right effusion.  No new focal opacity is identified.  No CHF.
