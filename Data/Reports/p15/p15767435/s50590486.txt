  ETT terminates 5.6 cm above the carina.  Low lung volumes and moderate
  cardiomegaly persist.  Medial right lung base and retrocardiac opacities are
  similar to prior and compatible with infection in the appropriate clinical
  setting.  Opacity overlying the right costophrenic angle is similar to prior
  and could represent atelectasis.  Left CP angle partially excluded. - ___

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intubation for airway protection, evaluation of endotracheal tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5.6 cm above the carina.
 Lung volumes are lower and mild cardiomegaly persists.  Unchanged evidence of
 mild pulmonary edema and bilateral basal opacities, likely caused by
 atelectasis.  No newly appeared lung parenchymal changes.  No pneumothorax.
