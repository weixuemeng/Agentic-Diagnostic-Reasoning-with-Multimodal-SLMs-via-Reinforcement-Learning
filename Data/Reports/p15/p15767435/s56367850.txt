                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 15:20.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with prolonged hospital course and new
 low-grade fever, evaluate for cardiopulmonary process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 10:48.
 
 Portable semi-upright chest film ___ at 15:20 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Status post median sternotomy with aortic valve replacement and stable cardiac
 enlargement.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Lung volumes remain low. 
 Bibasilar patchy opacities are stable and most likely reflect patchy
 atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  A probable small layering left effusion.  The
 patient's mandible obscures the apices, but no large pneumothorax is
 appreciated.
