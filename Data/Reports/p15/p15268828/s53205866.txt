                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post open right lower lobe lobectomy for carcinoid tumor.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain unchanged.  Again
 seen is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion with atelectasis, not
 significantly changed from prior. The previously seen right apical
 pneumothorax has resolved, and there is no left pneumothorax.  There is no new
 parenchymal consolidation. The left basilar consolidation is improved on the
 current study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Stable small-to-moderate right pleural effusion with associated consolidation,
 likely atelectasis.  Resolution of small right apical pneumothorax.
