                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of VATS right lower lobectomy for
 carcinoid. Patient with right pleural effusion status post thoracentesis. 
 Assess for post-procedural pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dating back to ___, most recent from ___ at 9:40 a.m.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:
 
 There has been no appreciable change in a known mild right pleural effusion
 after thoracentesis.  No large post-procedural pneumothorax is evident.  A
 tiny bit of air is likely within the pleural space due to recent
 instrumentation and fluid-level seen on the lateral view.  Atelectasis
 overlying a chronically elevated right hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  The right
 upper lung and left lung remain clear.  Upper mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  The heart size is unchanged and is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval thoracentesis on the right without significant change in moderate
 right pleural effusion.  No large post-procedural pneumothorax.
