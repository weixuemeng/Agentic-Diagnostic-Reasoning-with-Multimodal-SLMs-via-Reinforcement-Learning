                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after right thoracotomy,
 and chest tube removal.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 As compared to prior study obtained several hours earlier, there is interval
 increase in the right basal consolidation most likely reflecting increase in
 pleural effusion and atelectasis.  There is also small amount of apical
 pneumothorax present, overall unchanged since the prior study.  Left basal
 areas of atelectasis are demonstrated.  There is no evidence of pleural
 effusion on the left, but there is no evidence of pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax on the left.
