                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right effusion, to assess for possible thoracentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change
 in the appearance of the right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis
 at the base.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels raises the possibility
 of some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little overall change.
