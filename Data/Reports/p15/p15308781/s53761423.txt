                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Substernal chest pressure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  On the
 lateral view, projecting over the posterior mid thorax, there is a 2.3 x 2.2
 cm rounded opacity, difficult to discern whether osseous or pulmonary
 (lesion).  Recommend non-emergent chest CT for further evaluation.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced fracture
 is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 
 2.3 x 2.2 cm rounded opacity projecting over the posterior mid hemithorax,
 approximately at the level of the mid thoracic spine, difficult to truly
 discern whether osseous or pulmonary.  Recommend chest CT for further
 evaluation.
