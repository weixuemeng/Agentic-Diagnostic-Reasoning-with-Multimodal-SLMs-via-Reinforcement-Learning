                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of dyspnea and productive cough.  Please evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: The lungs are hyperexpanded consistent with advanced emphysema. 
 There is slight assymetry of the hemithoraces, smaller on the right, unchanged
 compared with ___.  The heart is not enlarged.  The hilar and mediastinal
 contours are probably unchanged.  There is a subtle increase in patchy
 opacification along the upper right lung compared to the prior exam. Opacity
 at the right base and midzone is improved. There is no frank consolidation and
 there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No CHF. The visualized osseous
 structures are grossly unremarkable. Tubing noted in the left upper quadrant,
 ? G-tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle increase in opacity overlying the upper right lung is
 concerning for pneumonia.
