                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with massive GI bleed after hanging and cardiac arrest
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP supine
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable AP supine chest radiograph provided.  Multiple overlying EKG
 leads are noted limiting assessment.  The endotracheal tube resides 2.1 cm
 above the carina.  The endogastric tube extends inferiorly along the thoracic
 midline though its inferior extent is not included within the field of view. 
 Diffuse pulmonary opacity is consistent with large volume aspiration and
 pulmonary edema as seen on subsequent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
