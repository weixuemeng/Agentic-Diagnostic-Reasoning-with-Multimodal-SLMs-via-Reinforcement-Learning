                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of cough, question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Minimal
 bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  Subtle left basilar opacities more likely
 relates to atelectasis rather than consolidation.  The cardiac silhouette
 remains mildly enlarged.  No pleural or pericardial effusion is seen. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is eventration of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  There is mild anterior wedging of the lower thoracic vertebral
 body, approximately T12, of indeterminate age.  Recommend clinical correlation
 for acuity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
 2.  Subtle slight left basilar opacity more likely reflects atelectasis rather
 than consolidation.
 3.  Mild anterior wedging of the lower thoracic vertebral body, approximately
 T12, of indeterminate age.  Recommend clinical correlation for acuity.
