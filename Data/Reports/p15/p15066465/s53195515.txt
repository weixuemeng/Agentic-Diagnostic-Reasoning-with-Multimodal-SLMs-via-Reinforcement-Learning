                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Cough with mild leukocytosis.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to portable exam
 from earlier the same day and chest x-ray from ___.  New from
 prior exam is retrocardiac opacity confirmed on the lateral view.  Elsewhere,
 the lungs are clear.  There is no effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged,
 not significantly changed from prior exam in ___.  There are enlarged
 pulmonary hila bilaterally as seen on prior portable exam.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left lower lobe opacity which could be compatible with pneumonia in the
 proper clinical setting.  Repeat exam suggested after treatment to document
 resolution.
 2.  Enlarged pulmonary hila bilaterally.  This can be due to pulmonary artery
 enlargement in the setting of pulmonary hypertension however this may also be
 due to hilar adenopathy.  CT scan with contrast suggested to further
 characterize.
