                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusions  // evaluate pleural
 effusions      evaluate pleural effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 14 58
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 831 are submitted
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar pigtail pleural catheters remain in place.  There is no large
 residual effusion, although of the presence of a small amount of fluid is
 still possible. The right subclavian PICC line is unchanged position. Surgical
 clips overlie the left axilla. Linear opacity at the left base most likely
 reflects subsegmental atelectasis. There is patchy opacity at the right base
 which also could reflect atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia should
 be considered. In addition, the interstitium is slightly more prominent on the
 current study raising the possibility of superimposed mild interstitial edema.
 Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.
