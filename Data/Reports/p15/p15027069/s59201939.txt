                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged, with the cardiac silhouette size within normal limits.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 is unchanged.  Hazy opacity in the left lung base may reflect atelectasis,
 though infection cannot be completely excluded.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  There are degenerative changes in the thoracic spine as well
 as involving the right acromioclavicular joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hazy opacity in the left lung base, which may reflect
 atelectasis, though infection is not completely excluded.
