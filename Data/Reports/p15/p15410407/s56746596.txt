                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Low hemoglobin, coughing, and small hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ obtained at 8:15 p.m.
 
 Since the prior study, there is interval progression of pulmonary edema, with
 small bilateral pleural effusions, fluid within the fissure, but unchanged
 appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Giving the rapidity of the
 changes, infection is unlikely.
