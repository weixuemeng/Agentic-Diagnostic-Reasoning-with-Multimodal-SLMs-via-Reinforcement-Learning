                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The size of the heart is difficult to assess owing to low lung volumes and
 overlapping soft tissue contours.  The aorta is moderately tortuous with
 calcification along the arch.  There is suggestion of mild central congestion
 but no focal opacification.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest mild vascular congestion.  No evidence of pneumonia.
