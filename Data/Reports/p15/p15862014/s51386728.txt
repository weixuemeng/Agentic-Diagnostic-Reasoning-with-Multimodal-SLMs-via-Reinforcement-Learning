                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent severe GI bleed, diffuse edema, some
 wheeze and mild dyspnea  // degree of pulmonary edema, new effusions?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable view of the chest dated ___, PA and lateral
 views of the chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is stably enlarged.  The aorta is calcified. Left
 basilar opacity is noted in the left lower lobe may be due to overlying soft
 tissues, though pneumonia must be considered in the appropriate clinical
 context.
 
 Given difference in technique, edema is likely mildly improved since recent
 comparison.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   Improved pulmonary edema from most recent comparison.
 2. Left lower lobe opacity may be consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical context.
