                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  HIV with weakness cough and ___ esophagitis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a mild interstitial abnormality
 primarily in the lower lungs, but not as severe and similar in pattern, so
 acuity is uncertain.  This is accompanied by a mild suspected persistent
 atelectasis in the right middle lobe which has however decreased.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decreased right middle lobe opacification but mild interstitial process which
 is of uncertain chronicity.
