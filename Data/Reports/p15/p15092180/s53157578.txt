                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  HIV and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is again an opacity in the right
 middle lobe and, more generally, an interstitial abnormality in the lower
 lungs.  However, this appearance is very similar to the prior radiographs. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar interstitial abnormality and focal right middle lobe opacities;
 possibilities include an acquired chronic interstitial abnormality with right
 middle lobe atelectasis, but recurrence of acute infectious process with the
 same pattern as before is not excluded.
