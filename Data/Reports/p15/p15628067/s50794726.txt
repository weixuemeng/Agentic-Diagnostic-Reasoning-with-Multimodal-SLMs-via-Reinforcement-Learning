 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube placement, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has
 been pulled back.  The tip of the tube now projects approximately 3-4 cm below
 the gastroesophageal junction.  The tube should be advanced by approximatively
 5 cm.
 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.  The lateral radiograph shows bilateral
 small-to-moderate pleural effusions.  Unchanged appearance of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Unchanged presence of basal areas of atelectasis.  No focal
 parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
