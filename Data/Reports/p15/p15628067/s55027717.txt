                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  NG tube placed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest read in conjunction with chest CT on ___:
 
 The upper enteric tube passes well into the stomach.  Course of the tube
 suggests the stomach is enlarged.
   
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are unchanged.  A
 wedge of consolidation in the right lower lung, is not contiguous with the
 diaphragmatic surface, and therefore is probably not the region of right basal
 atelectasis seen on yesterday's CT scan.  Could be new atelectasis or
 pneumonia.  Upper lungs are clear.  Heart size is top normal.  No
 pneumothorax.
