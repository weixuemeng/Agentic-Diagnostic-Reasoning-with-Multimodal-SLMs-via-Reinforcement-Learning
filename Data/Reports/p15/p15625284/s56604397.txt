                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Mild COPD and productive cough.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  The lungs are mildly
 hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is no evidence of pneumonia,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are mild degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.  Upper scoliosis might be positional.
