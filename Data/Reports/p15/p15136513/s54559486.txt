 INDICATION:  Dementia, status post multiple falls, assess for fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates stable
 prominent interstitial markings and known post-radiation paramediastinal
 fibrosis particularly evident in the left upper lung.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  There is stable cardiac enlargement which may
 represent cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be
 considered.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute changes.  Stable interstitial lung disease and cardiac
 enlargement.
