                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with abdominal pain and low flow in the right
 lower lobe.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Lower lung volumes seen on the
 current exam.  Even with this, indistinct pulmonary vascular markings suggest
 component of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Bibasilar opacities may be due to
 atelectasis given low lung volumes, although infection cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for technique.
 No acute osseous abnormalities identified.  Anterior wedging of the T12
 vertebral body is unchanged from prior.  Air-fluid levels identified in the
 abdomen, better characterized by CT of the abdomen performed the same day.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities, potentially
 atelectasis, although clinical correlation regarding possibility of infection
 is suggested.  Pulmonary vascular congestion.
