                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Hyperdense ornamentation projects over the upper chest although it does not
 for the most part obscure any important structures.  The lung volumes are low.
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Minor streaky opacities at the lung bases
 are most consistent with very minor atelectatic change.  Small calcified
 pleural plaques are again visualized primarily at the right lung apex greater
 than left, but not widespread.  Otherwise, the lung fields appear clear.  The
 bones appear demineralized.  Surgical clips project over the right upper
 quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
