                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Tachycardia wheeze.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Worsening left lower lobe and left perihilar opacities are due to worsening
 atelectasis, aspiration and/or mucus plugging could be present.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  If any, there is a small left pleural effusion.  Elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable
 with mild cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta.  Right lower lobe atelectases are
 unchanged.
