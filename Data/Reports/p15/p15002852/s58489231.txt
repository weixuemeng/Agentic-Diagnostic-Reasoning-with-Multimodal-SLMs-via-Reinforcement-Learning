                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Metastatic small cell lung cancer, assessment of
 Port-A-Cath placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right Port-A-Cath catheter tip can be seen approximately at the level of
 mid SVC.  Elevated left hemidiaphragm is even more pronounced than on the
 prior study.  The patient is slightly differently rotated, thus the appearance
 of the aortic knob is different, but overall most likely unchanged given
 positional differences.  There is no pneumothorax.  No interval development of
 pleural effusion can be appreciated.
