                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Orogastric tube placement.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the endotracheal
 tube and of the right internal jugular vein catheter are still visible.  The
 tip of the nasogastric tube project over the very proximal parts of the
 stomach, although the sidehole is not visible.  The course of the tube is
 unremarkable.  However, if secure position in the stomach is distended, the
 tube should be advanced by at least 5 cm.
 
 No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.  No other changes.
