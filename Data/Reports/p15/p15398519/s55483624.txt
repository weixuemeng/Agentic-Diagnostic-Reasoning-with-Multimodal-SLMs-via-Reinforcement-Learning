 HISTORY:  HIV and COPD with worsening shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has
 taken a much better inspiration.  Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the
 right base, though there is no evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular
 congestion or pleural effusion.
