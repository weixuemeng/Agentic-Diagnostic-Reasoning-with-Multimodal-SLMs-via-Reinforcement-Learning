                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  A prior study from same day.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Post-intubation, confirm position of the ET tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest is obtained.  The evaluation
 is limited as the lateral aspect of the right hemithorax is excluded.  The
 endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 3.6 cm above the
 carina.  There has also been placement of a nasogastric tube with its tip in
 the right upper quadrant.  Otherwise, there has been no change with small
 bibasilar atelectasis and relative mediastinal prominence, which likely
 reflect portable AP technique.
