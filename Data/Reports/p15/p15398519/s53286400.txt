                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:53 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypercarbic respiratory failure.  High peak
 pressures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ as late as 1:05 p.m.:
 
 Endotracheal tube 5 cm from the carina with chin in neutral position, standard
 placement.  Cuff caliber distends the native trachea.  These should be
 evaluated clinically to be sure that the inflation is optimal, possibly
 necessitated by high inspiratory pressures.
 
 The lungs are grossly clear, though there is mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  I see no consolidation or pulmonary edema, no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.
 
 Right internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC.  An upper enteric tube passes
 into the stomach and out of view, but the last side port is above the
 gastroesophageal junction and therefore the tube should be advanced at least 5
 cm to move all the ports into the stomach.
