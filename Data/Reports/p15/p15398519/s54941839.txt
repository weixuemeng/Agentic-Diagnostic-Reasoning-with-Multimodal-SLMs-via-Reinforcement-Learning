                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged,
 within the limitations of technique.  There is again mild-to-moderate relative
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the left.  A right mid lung
 opacity has resolved since the prior study.  There are, however, new streaky
 opacities in the right lower lobe with otherwise clear lungs.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy new right basilar opacification, which would perhaps be
 compatible with atelectasis associated with persistent elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, but pneumonia could also be considered in the appropriate
 setting.
