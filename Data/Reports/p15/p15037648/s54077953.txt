                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by positioning and the patient's chin obscuring the
 medial aspect of the lung apices.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are hyperinflated compatible with COPD
 without focal consolidation.  Increased interstitial opacities are unchanged,
 likely reflective of chronic interstitial abnormality.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are mild degenerative changes seen in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  COPD.
