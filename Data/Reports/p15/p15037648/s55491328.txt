                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever  // Eval for PNA, acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperexpanded.  Diffuse interstitial thickening is re-
 demonstrated, likely reflecting chronic interstitial lung disease.  There is
 increased opacification at the right lung base, which likely represents a
 developing pneumonia.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Opacification at the right lung base concerning for developing pneumonia.
 2. Hyperexpanded lungs with chronic interstitial thickening, likely
 representing interstitial lung disease.
