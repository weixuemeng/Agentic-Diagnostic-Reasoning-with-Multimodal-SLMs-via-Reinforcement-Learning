                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with previous aortic valve
 replacement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable.  Heart size and mediastinal silhouette
 are within normal limits.  Replaced aortic valve is in expected position.
 
 There is new right suprahilar opacity, not seen on the prior study and
 potentially may represent interval development of infectious process,
 attention to this area on the subsequent studies is required.  
 
 There is a small amount of pleural effusion, bilateral.
 
 The patient is after resection of the distal portion of the right clavicle.
