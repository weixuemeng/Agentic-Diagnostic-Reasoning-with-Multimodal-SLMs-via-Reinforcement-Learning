                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:25 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with rising white count.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 The only region of questionable pulmonary abnormality is at the left lung
 base.  I strongly recommend conventional radiographs if feasible to evaluate
 possible pneumonia.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Pleural effusion, minimal if
 any.  Slight interval increase in heart size, still normal.
