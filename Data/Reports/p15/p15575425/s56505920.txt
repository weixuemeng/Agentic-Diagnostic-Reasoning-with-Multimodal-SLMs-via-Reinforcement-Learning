                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Coughing for three weeks and nonsmoker, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette
 remains within normal limits and there is no evidence of vascular congestion
 or pleural effusion.  On the lateral view, there is a predominantly linear
 opacification in the region of the major fissure that was present on prior
 study.  No acute focal pneumonia is appreciated at this time.
