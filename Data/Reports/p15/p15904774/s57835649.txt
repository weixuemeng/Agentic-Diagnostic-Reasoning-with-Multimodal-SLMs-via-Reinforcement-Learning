                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and congestion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is somewhat prominent peribronchial
 vascular opacification in each infrahilar region, particularly the right,
 which raises some concern for bronchopneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague lower lung opacities concerning for pneumonia in the
 appropriate setting but not vague and not very specific.  This study was
 performed with AP technique.  If necessary, findings could probably be better
 delineated with PA technique if needed clinically.
