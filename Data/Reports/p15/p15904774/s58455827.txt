                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Productive cough and fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lung volumes
 are low.  No definite sign of pneumonia or CHF.  Minimal streaky lower lung
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The heart and mediastinal contours appear normal.  The bony structures are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild limitation due to low lung volumes without definite signs of
 pneumonia.
