                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with lymphoma status post PICC
 placement, contact ___, ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  The chest findings on the single frontal view are grossly
 within normal limits.  Again a right-sided PICC line is identified, seen to
 terminate overlying the right-sided mediastinal structures at 2 cm below the
 carina.  This is compatible with the mid portion of the SVC.  No pneumothorax
 or any other placement-related complication is seen.  In comparison with the
 previous study, there existed already a PICC line, almost in identical
 position.  Clinical findings must determine whether this is the same line or a
 new one has been placed.  ___ was placed to ___ at 2 p.m.
