                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post PICC line placement.  History of lymphoma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a right-sided PICC line in situ, which probably terminates
 in the upper part of the superior vena cava shortly below the confluence of
 the brachiocephalic veins, somewhat pulled back from its prior position. 
 However, because of overlying soft tissue attenuation, the catheter is
 difficult to follow into the mediastinum, so it may terminate somewhat lower
 in the superior vena cava.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs
 appear clear.    
 
 IMPRESSION:  PICC line apparently terminating in the upper superior vena cava,
 although owing to poor visualization of its course in the mediastinum, it may
 protrude somewhat inferiorly than is apparent from this image.  No evidence of
 acute disease.
