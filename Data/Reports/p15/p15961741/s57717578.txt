                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fever, recent
 diagnosis of lymphoma, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle left
 base opacity likely relates to vascular structures or atelectasis, although in
 the appropriate clinical setting, a very early consolidation cannot be
 excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
