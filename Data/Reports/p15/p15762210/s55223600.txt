                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of metastatic melanoma to the liver and
 worsening jaundice.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  This study is technically limited due to the patient's body habitus
 and positioning.  Allowing for this limitation, the lungs are hypoinflated,
 resulting in bronchovascular crowding, but there is no focal opacity
 suggestive of pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged from the previous
 examination.  Cardiac size is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
