 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are grossly clear
 noting linear bibasilar opacities which are most likely atelectasis.  Please
 note that the lateral view is limited secondary to patient's arms being down
 by his side.  There is no large effusion, although there may be trace right
 pleural effusion noting that the posterior costophrenic angle is obscured. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.  Orthopedic hardware seen in the right glenoid.
