                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  History of lung cancer, hyponatremia
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiograph were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance.  Lungs are hyperinflated
 but essentially clear.  Bibasal flattening of the diaphragm is  consistent
 with hyperinflation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Post-surgical changes in the right hemithorax are stable.  Overall there are
 no findings to explain hyponatremia on the current chest radiograph.
