                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness and decreased p.o. intake.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms suggesting COPD.  The
 patient is rotated somewhat to the right.  Minor basilar atelectasis is seen. 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistently hyperinflated lungs suggesting chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  Otherwise, no significant interval change and no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
