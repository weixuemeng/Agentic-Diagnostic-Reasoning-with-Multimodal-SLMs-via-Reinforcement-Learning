                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the nasogastric tube has been
 removed.  Right IJ catheter tip extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
 
 The cardiomediastinal appearance is unchanged and there is no evidence of
 vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.  There is pleural effusion best
 seen posteriorly, most likely on the left.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs
 suggests some chronic pulmonary disease.
