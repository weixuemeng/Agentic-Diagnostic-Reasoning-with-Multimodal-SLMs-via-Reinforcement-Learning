 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the bowel cough tube is been
 removed. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size or
 slightly enlarged. Poor definition of pulmonary vessels is consistent with
 some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  There is suggestion of some
 increased opacification in the left perihilar and and lower zone.  Although
 this could merely reflect some elevated pulmonary vascularity, in the
 appropriate clinical setting the possibility of superimposed pneumonia could
 be considered.
