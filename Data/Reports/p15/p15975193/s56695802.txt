                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left arm pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is limited due to patient body habitus.  However, there
 is an increased opacity in the retrocardiac region.  Mild right basal
 atelectasis identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is moderately
 enlarged.  No acute fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1)  Limited study due to patient body habitus demonstrates increased
 retrocardiac opacity.  This is likely atelectasis, however, pneumonia must be
 excluded in the proper clinical setting. A lateral view may be obtained for
 further characterization. 
 
 2)  Moderate cardiomegaly.
