                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with +ppd  // r/o TB
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upper AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Streaky left lower lobe atelectasis is
 noted. A rounded density in the left hilar region may reflect partially
 calcified lymphadenopathy.  No right hilar adenopathy is identified. The
 cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Rounded left hilar density may reflect partially calcified lymphadenopathy in
 the setting of prior granulomatous disease exposure.  No focal consolidation
 is identified.  Findings could be further assessed on CT.
