                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded.  Mild interstitial markings are unchanged
 compared to ___ and likely reflect a component of chronic
 interstitial lung disease.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is again top normal.  Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar silhouettes are unremarkable, again noting marked tortuosity of the
 ascending and descending thoracic aorta.  Mild rightward deviation of the
 trachea is likely related to aortic tortuosity.  Incidental note is made of
 severe osseous demineralization.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
