 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:00 PM
  
  
  The pleural pigtail catheter appears to be in satisfactory position.  The left
  pneumothorax is not clearly identified on the frontal view.  There are
  bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions with atelectasis at the left
  lung base.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette are unchanged.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 12:52 AM
  The pleural pigtail catheter appears to be in satisfactory position.  The left
  pneumothorax is not clearly identified on the frontal view.  There are
  bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions with atelectasis at the left
  lung base.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette are unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORTABLE PICC LINE PLACEMENT
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p new port placement now with newly diagnosed
 pneumothorax, s/p pigtail chest drain  // proper placement of pigtail chest
 drain on L side
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:21
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, a left pigtail type catheter has been placed,
 partially obscured by the indwelling catheter, but otherwise grossly
 unremarkable.  The pneumothorax is considerably decreased in size.  A small
 residual pneumothorax is likely present, with faint lucency seen at the left
 lung apex.  This may also account for lucency medially, in the region of the
 aortic knob.
 
 There are small bilateral effusions, with bibasilar atelectasis.  No
 right-sided pneumothorax is detected.  The  cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 grossly unchanged and remains midline.  The tip of the indwelling catheter
 overlies the mid/distal SVC.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left-sided pneumothorax has decreased in size compared with earlier the same
 day.  Suspect faint residua at the lung apex and along the medial aspect of
 the lung.
 
 (This impression differs slightly from the resident wet reading, but is
 addressed on report from a subsequent radiograph from ___ at 10:25,
 which was issued prior to the resident wet reading.)
