                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PNX s/p CT placement  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a small left apical pneumothorax.  Lucency at the left lung base also
 is suspected to represent a portion of the pneumothorax.  There is a small
 left effusion.  A left sided pigtail type catheter is in place, overall
 similar, but slightly different in configuration.  A portion of the tip is
 obscured by the patient's indwelling catheter.  There is increased
 retrocardiac opacity likely representing combination of left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation pleural fluid, similar to the prior study.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.  No CHF.  Small right
 pleural effusion is unchanged.  No right-sided pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Again seen is a left-sided indwelling catheter, with tip over distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation unchanged.
 2. Left pigtail type catheter slightly different in configuration, but overall
 similar, partially obscured by the indwelling catheter.  Note is made that the
 pig tail portion is not clearly well formed on the available images, though
 this could be artifact due to positioning.
 3. Left apical lucency represents a small left pneumothorax, increased
 compared with the most recent prior film.  Lucency at the left base is also
 thought represent a pneumothorax.  This is slightly more pronounced/ visible
 on the current exam, though it is possible that this is due to the interval
 improvement in a small left pleural effusion.  Attention to this area on
 followup films is requested.
