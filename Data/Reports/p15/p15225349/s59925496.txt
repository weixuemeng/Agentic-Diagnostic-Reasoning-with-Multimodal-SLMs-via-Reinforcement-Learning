                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F cecal adenoca w/liver met s/p lap segment 6 wedge on ___
 c/b subhepatic collection s/p drainage now w/reaccum fluid, large
 pericardial/pleural effusion s/p pericardial window, BL CT  // Possible
 infection or worsening infusion    Possible infection or worsening infusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the anterior and posterior air-
 levels are unchanged, consistent with regions of hydro pneumothorax.  The
 small apical pneumothorax on the left is unchanged.  Bibasilar opacifications
 are consistent with atelectatic changes and pleural effusion bilaterally.  The
 possibility of superimposed pneumonia can certainly not be excluded.
