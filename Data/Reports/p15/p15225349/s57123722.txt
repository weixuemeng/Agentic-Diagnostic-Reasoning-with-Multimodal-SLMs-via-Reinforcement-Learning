                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PTX after port placement  // evaluate
 pneumothorax with portable suction
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:25
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, the left apical component of the
 pneumothorax appears similar.  The component along the medial portion of the
 lung near the aortic knob is similar, possibly very slightly larger.  The
 hydro pneumothorax at the left lung base is slightly different in
 configuration, but not clearly larger.  The lateral view shows an additional
 retrosternal component.
 
 The left chest tube and left indwelling catheter are both similar in position
 and configuration.  Slight irregularity in the proximal portion of the
 catheter near the port has been stable and likely relates to the construction
 of the Port-A-Cath, but clinical correlation is requested to confirm this.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar, grossly midline, allowing for
 slight rotation.
 
 There is a small right effusion, which is also similar.  Probable atelectasis
 at the right lung base.  Eventrated contour of the right hemidiaphragm is
 unchanged.  No right apical pneumothorax is identified.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite change in size of the left-sided pneumothorax.  The component
 adjacent to the aortic knob may be very slightly larger.  The hydro
 pneumothorax at the left base is slightly different in configuration, but not
 clearly larger.  The lateral view demonstrates a retrosternal component. 
 Although none of these enumerated components are individually especially
 large, taken together, the overall size of the pneumothorax is appreciable
 (small to moderate).
 
 The chest tube and Port-A-Cath are unchanged.  Clinical correlation regarding
 the Port-A-Cath is requested --___ see comment above.
