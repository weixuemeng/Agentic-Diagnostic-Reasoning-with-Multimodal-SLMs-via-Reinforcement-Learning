                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a left pneumothorax and pigtail in place,
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ at 17:59.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval improvement in the overall size of left pneumothorax. 
 There has been interval decrease in size of the left apical component -- a
 small residual left apical component remains visible.  The left costophrenic
 angle component is re-demonstrated, compatible with small residual
 pneumothorax.  The retrosternal/medial component adjacent to the mediastinum
 is much smaller and less conspicuous, nearly resolved.  Hydro pneumothoraces 
 are again seen both anteriorly and posteriorly on the lateral view .  There is
 no evidence of shift of mediastinal structures.  A left pigtail catheter is in
 unchanged position along the left chest wall.  Small foci of subcutaneous gas
 along catheter tract are unchanged.  The aerated portions of the left lung and
 the right lung are grossly clear.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  There is no right
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval near-complete resolution of the apical and retrosternal components
 of the left pneumothorax.  Residual left costophrenic angle small
 hydropneumothorax, possibly loculated.  On the lateral view, components are
 seen both anteriorly and posteriorly.  Left pigtail catheter along the left
 chest wall is in unchanged, grossly appropriate position.
 2. Stable small right pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 12:08 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
