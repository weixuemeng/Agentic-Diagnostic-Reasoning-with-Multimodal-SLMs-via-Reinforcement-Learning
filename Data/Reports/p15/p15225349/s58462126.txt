  In comparison to prior same-day chest x-ray from ___ at 10:36, there has
  been interval enlargement of left-sided pneumothorax status post water seal of
  pigtail catheter.  Again visible are apical and superolateral components of
  the pneumothorax, as well as a a sizable anterior component seen on lateral
  view, similar in size and appearance to previous chest x-ray from ___ at 17:59, but increased compared with the film from ___:00 the
  same day.  Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  Overall, interval
  enlargement of the pneumothorax component of a small to moderate left-sided
  hydro-pneumothorax.  No shift of mediastinal structures.  No additional
  significant interval changes.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PTX s/p port placement  // Please do exam
 at ___ ___. Question: status of PTX (put on water seal ___ ___).
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ ___ at 10:36
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to prior same-day chest x-ray from ___ at 10:36, there has
 been interval enlargement of the left-sided pneumothorax, status post water
 seal of pigtail catheter.
 
 Again visible are apical and superolateral components of the pneumothorax,
 similar, but slightly increased in size.
 
 There is has been  re-appearance of a sizable anterior/retro-sternal component
 seen on lateral view -- this is similar in size and appearance to previous
 chest x-ray from ___ at 17:59, but increased compared with the film
 obtained earlier today.
 
 The hydro pneumo thorax component seen posteriorly on the lateral view is
 fairly similar to the most recent prior film.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
 
 No shift of mediastinal structures. No additional significant interval
 changes.  Minimal atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval reaccumulation of the left-sided pneumothorax, detailed above. 
 Interval change is most striking in relation to the anterior component of the
 pneumothorax, seen behind the sternum on the lateral view.
