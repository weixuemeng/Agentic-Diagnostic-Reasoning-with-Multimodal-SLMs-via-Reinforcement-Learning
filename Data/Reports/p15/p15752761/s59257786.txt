                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with recent intubation, evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 5.4 cm from the carina, in satisfactory
 position.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and terminates within
 the stomach, however the side port is approximately at the level of the GE
 junction.  This should be advanced 4-5 cm for optimal positioning. 
 Single-chamber pacemaker lead projects in expected location.  Bilateral
 interstitial opacities could represent volume overload or infectious process. 
 Suggestion of nodularity in the right upper lung is better evaluated by same
 day chest CT.  There is no pneumothorax.  There may be a trace left pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Enteric tube should be advanced 4-5 cm for optimal positioning with all
 ports within the stomach.
 2. Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position.
 3. Bilateral interstitial opacities could represent volume overload or
 infectious process with suggestion of nodularity within the right lung.
