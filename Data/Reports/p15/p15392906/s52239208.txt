                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with chest pain  // evidence of infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings are seen throughout the lungs bilaterally,
 overall similar when compared to prior.  There is no new consolidation or
 effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Chronic deformities seen in the ribs bilaterally suggest prior
 fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation.  Increased interstitial markings in the lungs,
 potentially due to interstitial edema although given chronicity, chronic
 underlying interstitial process is also possible.
