                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with knee fracture, preop.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Lateral view is
 limited due to overlying soft tissues.  There is a focal opacity in the left
 mid lung, not clearly delineated on the lateral view, but potentially in the
 lower lobe.  Focal opacity also identified at the right lung base laterally,
 potentially due to pleural thickening or scarring.  There is no effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for technique. 
 Atherosclerotic calcification is noted at the arch.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected, although bones are diffusely osteopenic, limiting
 evaluation.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  A nodular somewhat irregular
 opacity in the left lung.  Given patient is asymptomatic based on this preop
 film, dedicated non-urgent chest CT is suggested to further evaluate.
