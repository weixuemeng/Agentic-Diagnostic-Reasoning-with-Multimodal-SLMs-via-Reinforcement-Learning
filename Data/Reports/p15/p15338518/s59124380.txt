 PORTABLE SUPINE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:
 
 The small right pleural effusion and associated atelectasis is unchanged. 
 There is suggestion of a new small left pleural effusion with persistent
 atelectasis obscuring the hemidiaphragm.  Mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary
 vascular congestion are unchanged.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  A right IJ central venous line terminates in the SVC.  There
 are subtle linear irregularities of several left ribs and at least one right
 rib which may indicate the presence of nondisplaced fractures.
