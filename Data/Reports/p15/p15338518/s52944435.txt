 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Productive cough, postoperative decreased arousal, evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the preoperative radiograph, there is a minimal
 decrease in overall lung volumes.  As a consequence, a small retrocardiac
 atelectasis is seen.  However, there is no evidence of pneumonia.  Borderline
 size of the cardiac silhouette.  The presence of a minimal left pleural
 effusion cannot be excluded.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
