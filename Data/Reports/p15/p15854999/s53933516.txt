                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intracranial hemorrhage, intubated, evaluate for endotracheal
 tube position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier on the same day at 12:00
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates in the mid trachea. There has been interval
 placement of an enteric tube although the tip appears to course out of the
 field of view of this exam.  A superiorly projecting tube over the mediastinum
 is likely external to the patient given adjacent contiguous tubing. Multiple
 EKG leads are noted overlying the chest externally. No focal consolidations
 identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminating in the mid trachea in satisfactory position.
