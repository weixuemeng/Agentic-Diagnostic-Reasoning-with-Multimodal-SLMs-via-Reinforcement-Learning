                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative bypass.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is free intraperitoneal gas beneath the
 hemidiaphragms bilaterally, consistent with recent surgery.  Areas of
 increased opacification are seen at the bases, especially on the left,
 although this could merely reflect post-operative atelectasis, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be seriously
 considered.
 
 No vascular congestion.
