                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man, with laparoscopic Nissen takedown with
 postoperative aspiration of contrast and delayed emptying on upper GI.  Assess
 for intrathoracic process and evidence of retained contrast.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso on ___.  Also chest radiograph on ___.
 
 SINGLE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is a small amount of retained enteric
 contrast in the epigastric region, probably in a residual Nissen pouch.  There
 is a moderate amount of contrast in the transverse colon.
 
 The lung volumes are low.  Again noted are bibasilar opacities, slightly
 improved at the left base compared to the prior chest radiograph, in keeping
 with the patient's aspiration event.  There is no new focal airspace
 consolidation.  No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is noted.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette remains within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  A small amount of retained enteric contrast in the epigastrium, probably
 in a residual Nissen pouch.  Enteric contrast in the transverse colon.
 
 2.  Interval mild improvement of bibasilar opacities, representing the known
 multifocal aspiration and/or superimposed infection.
