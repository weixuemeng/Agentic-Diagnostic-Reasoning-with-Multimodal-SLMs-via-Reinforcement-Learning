                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  GERD and obesity post-operatively, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is some clearing of the
 bibasilar areas of opacification consistent with pneumonia.  The area just
 above the minor fissure also is seen, consistent with some residual
 consolidation in this region as well.
 
 There is some contrast material in what appears to be the distal esophagus as
 well as in the colon as well as what appears to be the stomach.  Whether this
 reflects any degree of obstruction is difficult to assess on a single static
 image.
