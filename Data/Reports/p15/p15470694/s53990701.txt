                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Patchy and
 linear bibasilar opacities have slightly improved in the interval.  These
 findings are nonspecific but may be related to the patient's recent aspiration
 event.  No new areas of lung opacification are identified.  Please note that
 the small foci of aspirated contrast on the prior CT torso ___ ___,
 may be difficult to visualize on portable chest radiographs.  Retained enteric
 contrast is visualized in the epigastric region and has decreased in amount
 since the prior radiograph.
