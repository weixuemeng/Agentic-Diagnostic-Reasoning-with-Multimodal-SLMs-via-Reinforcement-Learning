                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath, here to evaluate for
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Both lungs are symmetrically hyperinflated with flattening of the
 bilateral hemidiaphragms, compatible with COPD.  Biapical opacities are likely
 related to scarring.  No significant pleural effusion, focal consolidation, or
 pneumothorax is detected.  No pulmonary edema is noted.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
