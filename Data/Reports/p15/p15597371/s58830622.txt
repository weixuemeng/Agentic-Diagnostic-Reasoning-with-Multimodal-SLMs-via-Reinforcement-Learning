                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 12:24 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with Guillain-___ syndrome, now with
 desaturation into the low 90s, question acute lung process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 12:24 a.m. is submitted. Best
 possible image was obtained as the patient was confused and had difficulty
 cooperating for the examination.  Patient is markedly rotated. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The patient's mandible obscures the right apex. There continues to be
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  There is a patchy opacity at the left
 base which may reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or
 aspiration should also be considered.  Overall, the lung volumes are
 diminished but the right lung is grossly clear.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Heart is stably enlarged.  Evaluation of mediastinal
 contours is limited due to marked patient rotation.
