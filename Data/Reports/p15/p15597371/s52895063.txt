 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with Guillain-___ syndrome, question
 resolution of edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 Portable AP semi-upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lung volumes remain low.  There is persistent stable opacity at the left
 base which could reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis, pneumonia or
 aspiration.  No pulmonary edema.  Low lung volumes.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to marked patient rotation
 and the left airspace disease.  No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to
 detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
