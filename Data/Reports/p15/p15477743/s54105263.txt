 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.

 silhouette and hilar contours are stable.  There is no cardiomegaly.  There is
 no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Apical thickening is stable. Well
 circumscribed opacity in the retrocardiac region on the lateral radiograph
 anterior to the aorta is likely a distended lower esophagus with retained
 enteric material or a hiatal hernia. Chronic left rib fractures are
 redemonstrated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Well circumscribed opacity in the retrocardiac region likely
 reflects distended lower esophagus with retained food or a hiatal hernia. No
 evidence of pneumonia.
