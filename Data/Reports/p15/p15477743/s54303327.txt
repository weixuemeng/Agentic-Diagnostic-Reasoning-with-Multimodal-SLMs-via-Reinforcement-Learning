                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with remote breast and lung
 cancer, currently with chest pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiograph were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Since the prior radiograph, there is no substantial change in the
 cardiomediastinal contour including the post-surgical changes in the left
 hemithorax.  Heart size is normal, and mediastinum is unchanged in appearance.
 The multifocal opacities seen on the prior radiograph appear to be
 substantially improved.  Multifocal areas of calcifications projecting over
 the both lungs are unchanged.  There is no interval development of new
 abnormalities.  Apical thickening is stable since the prior radiograph, and
 the lung bases are clear with no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Overall, there is no evidence of acute process on the current examination. 
 Comparison with more remote radiographs to assess the stability of the apical
 thickening is recommended.
