 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.

 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Lung
 volumes are slightly decreased. Left midline linear opacity likely reflects
 atelectasis.  There is however no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
