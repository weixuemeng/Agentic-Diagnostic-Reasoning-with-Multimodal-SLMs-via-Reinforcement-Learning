 INDICATION:    ___M with CHF, cholangitis  // eval ? free air, pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Relatively low lung more volumes are noted with bibasilar opacities which may
 be due to atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  There is
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette likely accentuated by poor inspiratory
 effort with possible superimposed mild cardiomegaly.  Elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm is noted.  Dense atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the
 aortic arch.  Old healed right posterior rib fracture is noted.  There is no
 acute osseous abnormality.  No free intraperitoneal air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities likely atelectasis, infection is not excluded.  No overt
 pulmonary edema.
