                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:   ___M with cholangitis, sepsis, s/p RIJ placement  // eval RIJ
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Correlation made to same-day chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right IJ catheter is seen with tip terminating over the lower SVC.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Relatively low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities, likely
 due to atelectasis in this setting of low lung volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged, likely due to poor inspiratory effort with possible superimposed
 mild cardiomegaly.  Elevation the left hemidiaphragm is seen.  Dense
 atherosclerotic calcifications are again noted at the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right IJ catheter with tip terminating over the lower SVC.  No pneumothorax.
