                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes and
 patchy retrocardiac opacities.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen throughout the aorta. 
 The heart size is normal.  The right hilum is not well seen but has a rounded
 contour.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Patchy retrocardiac opacities may represent atelectasis, less likely
 infection.  Evaluation with PA and lateral views may be helpful.
 
 2.  Right hilar contour of mild prominence, probably normal, but comparison to
 old images if available or repeat chest radiographs is recommended to reassess
 given the limitations of AP technique.
