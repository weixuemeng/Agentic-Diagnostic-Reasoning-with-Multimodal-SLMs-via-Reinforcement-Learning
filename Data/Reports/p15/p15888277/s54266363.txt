                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old with chest pain has stent ___ years ago.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 slight prominence of the interstitial markings, most likely chronic versus
 minimal interstitial edema.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  On the lateral view, there is a
 retrocardiac opacity which is difficult to determine whether it represents a
 hiatal hernia or the aorta and dilatation of the descending aorta is not
 excluded and could be further evaluated for on chest CT.  The aorta is
 calcified.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Evidence of prior
 vertebroplasty plus kyphoplasty is seen in the lower thoracic spine.  There is
 also loss of height of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction below
 level of the diaphragm, not well evaluated.
