                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and concurrent CT C-spine
 from ___
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A heterogeneous right apical lung opacity
 is better characterized on concurrent CT cervical spine examination.  There is
 blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles suggestive of small effusions
 and probable underlying atelectasis.  The remainder of the lungs appear clear.
 The patient is rotated, making assessment of mediastinal contours difficult. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Healed bilateral rib and humeral neck
 fractures are again noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  Surgical clips project
 over the left upper quadrant.  Fracture median sternotomy wires appear
 unchanged from prior.  Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are similar
 to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Heterogeneous opacity in the right lung apex, better seen on concurrent
 cervical spine CT.  Followup dedicated chest CT is recommended to ensure
 resolution.
 
 2.  Probable small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis
 
 3.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly
