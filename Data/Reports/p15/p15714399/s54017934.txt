                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pancreatitis and shortness of breath.  To evaluate for pulmonary
 edema or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed.  No prior chest
 radiographs are available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left lower lung opacity and increased retrocardiac density reflects
 combination of effusion and accompanying passive atelectasis. If any of this
 represents infection, cannot be convincingly ruled out on the single frontal
 chest radiograph alone and should be correlated clinically.  Small right
 pleural effusion and  minimal right basal atelectasis is present .  Upper
 lungs are clear.  Heart size is mildly enlarged and has a triangular
 configuration and is concerning for pericardial effusion.  Echocardiography is
 recommended for further evaluation.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild-to-moderate left and minimal right pleural effusion with accompanying
 atelectasis.  If any of this left lower lung opacity represents concurrently
 associated infection, cannot be ruled out, requires further clinical
 correlation.
 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly with a triangular configuration of the heart which is
 concerning for pericardial effusion.  Echocardiography is recommended for
 further evaluation.
