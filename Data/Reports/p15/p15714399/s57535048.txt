                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with resolving pancreatitis, white blood
 count ___.7, with shortness of breath and pleural effusions.  ? pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is unchanged.  Mild
 cardiomegaly cannot be excluded as patient's diaphragms are relatively high
 positioned and obscure major portions of cardiac contours.  There is, however,
 no evidence of any significant pulmonary vascular congestion.  A previously
 described density on the left base persists and indicates the presence of some
 small amount of pleural effusion blunting the left lateral and posterior
 pleural sinus, coinciding with a rather linear density suggestive of
 compression atelectasis in this area and already described on the preceding
 examination.  No significant interval change has occurred.  The right lung
 does not demonstrate any significant parenchymal abnormality.  No pneumothorax
 exists in the apical area.  Considering that the patient was described to
 suffer from acute pancreatitis when transferred from ___,
 such diagnosis can explain this pleural effusion as relate to inflammatory
 processes, predominantly in the tail portion of the pancreas. In comparison
 with the next preceding chest examination from ___, no significant interval
 change can be identified.
