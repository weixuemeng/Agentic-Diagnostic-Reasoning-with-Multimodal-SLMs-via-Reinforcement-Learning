                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever, cough  // eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is heterogeneous opacification of the right lung base, which likely
 represents a developing right lower lobe pneumonia.  Linear opacity also noted
 at the left lung base, potentially atelectasis.  The remainder of the lungs
 are clear.  Heart size and mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Osseous structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar regions of consolidation, which could be due to pneumonia in the
 proper clinical setting.  Component of atelectasis, particularly on the left
 is also possible.
