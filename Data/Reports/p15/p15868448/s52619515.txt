                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Alcoholic hepatitis, possible pneumonia and fluid overload.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Central lines, ET tube, and NG tube are unchanged.  There is
 worsening appearance to the lungs with pulmonary vascular re-distribution,
 volume loss at both bases and probable bilateral effusions.  Areas of
 consolidation in the bilateral lower lobes have increased and it is unclear
 how much of this is due to lower lobe volume loss or if an underlying
 infectious infiltrate is present.
