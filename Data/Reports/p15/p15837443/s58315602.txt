                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever, altered mental status, and hypertension;
 question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SINGLE PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Lung volumes are again low. A
 generalized increase in the radiodensity in the lower lungs could be due to
 edema, less likely to pneumonia, although this is still conceivable if the
 patient's clinical picture fits. 
 
 Bibasilar streaky atelectasis remains. Patient is status post median
 sternotomy.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Generalized increase in the radiodensity in the lower lungs could
 be due to edema, less likely pneumonia.
