 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with green sputum, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT abdomen pelvis ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is accentuated as a result and appears at
 least mild to moderately enlarged, similar to the previous study.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases are likely reflective of aspiration or
 pneumonia, greater on the right, and better assessed on the same day CT.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases, more pronounced on the
 right, concerning for aspiration or pneumonia, as seen on the same day CT.
