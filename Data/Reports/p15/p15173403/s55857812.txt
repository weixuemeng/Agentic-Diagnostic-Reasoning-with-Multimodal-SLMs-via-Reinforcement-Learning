                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent fall with a right pneumothorax.  Re-evaluate after chest tube
 removal.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A right chest tube has been removed with a tiny residual
 pneumothorax identified.  There is new consolidation in the left lung base. 
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.
 
 Obliquely oriented linear opacities project over the right hemithorax.  While
 some may represent displaced rib fractures, others are thought to be external.
 A small amount of subcutaneous air along the right lateral chest wall
 persists.  The bones are diffusely osteopenic which limits evaluation of the
 known compression fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tiny remnant pneumothorax after chest tube removal.  
 2.  New consolidation of the left lower lobe is likely atelectasis.
 3.  Repeat radiograph with removal of bandages is recommended to further
 evaluate linear opacity overlying the right chest.
 
 These findings were paged to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 16:11 on ___ at
 the time of discovery.
