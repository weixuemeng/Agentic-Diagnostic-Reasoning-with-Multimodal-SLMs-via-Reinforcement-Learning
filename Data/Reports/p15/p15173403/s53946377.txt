                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 9:36.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  Again,
 there are multiple right-sided rib fractures with overlying soft tissue
 emphysema along the right chest wall extending into the right neck.  There has
 been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube which crosses the midline
 and approaches the diaphragm, difficult to discern whether it is truly above
 the diaphragm.
 
 The above findings were discussed with ___ at 5:15 p.m. on ___, 5
 minutes after discovery.  
 
 Blunting of the right costophrenic angle raises concern for a small pleural
 effusion.  Otherwise, lung fields are grossly stable.
