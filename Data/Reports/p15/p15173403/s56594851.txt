                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of fall on ___. 
 Evaluate rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with
 patient in upright position.  The heart size is stable showing a relative
 prominence of the left ventricular contour, but no signs of left atrial
 enlargement or pulmonary congestion.  Appearance of thoracic aorta with
 general widening and moderate elongation unchanged.  The previously described
 multiple right-sided rib fractures with considerable displacement remain
 unchanged in position; however, the surrounding soft tissue prominences have
 regressed markedly.  There remains a mild blunting of the right lateral
 pleural sinus, likely representing scar formations now.  The thickening of the
 lower right lateral pleural space along the chest wall has regressed
 considerably.  There is no evidence of new pulmonary abnormalities.  The left
 hemithorax remains unchanged without evidence of new abnormalities.
 
 Unchanged position of previously described multiple right-sided displaced rib
 fractures but regression of soft tissue thickenings indicating healing.  No
 new pulmonary or cardiovascular abnormalities are identified.
