                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Trauma status post chest tube placement, now to water seal
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 547.
 
 FINDINGS: An increasing lucency at the right lung base is thought to represent
 a growing subpulmonic pneumothorax.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures are
 again demonstrated as is subcutaneous emphysema of the right chest wall, which
 is stable.  Parenchymal opacities are consistent with contusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible slightly increasing subpulmonic pneumothorax. 
 
 Findings of possible free air discussed with ___ at 14:49 via
 telephone by ___ immediately upon discovery of the findings. ___
 repaged at 3:11 pm to discuss change in initial wet read with free air being
 unlikely, rather increasing subpulmonic pneumothorax.
