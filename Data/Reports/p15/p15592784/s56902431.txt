                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of cancer, dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size
 within normal limits.  Mild atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the
 aortic knob.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Linear opacities within
 the left lung base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Vertebra plana of
 the T11 vertebral body is re- demonstrated.  Remote fracture of the distal
 right clavicle is also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
