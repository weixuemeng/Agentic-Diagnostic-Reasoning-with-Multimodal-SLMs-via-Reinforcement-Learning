                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CAD, here with ongoing chest pain  // Any
 evidence of pna?      Any evidence of pna?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased prominence of
 the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion.  Atelectatic
 streaks are seen at the left base and the medial portion of the left
 hemidiaphragm is silhouetted, possibly related to some volume loss in the left
 lower lobe.
 There is the suggestion of increased opacification in the right mid zone,
 though this is difficult to assess due to the multiple monitor leads overlying
 the area.  If the clinical condition of the patient permits, a lateral view
 could be helpful.
