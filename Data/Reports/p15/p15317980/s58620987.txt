                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent CABG about 3 weeks ago now with
 progressive acute on chronic chest pain since her surgery.  // ? acute
 pulmonary process, aortic dissection
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph, frontal view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffusely increased attenuation in the lungs and increased size of cardio
 mediastinal silhouette are consistent with pulmonary edema due to
 biventricular heart failure or fluid overload.  There is new left lower lobe
 collapse in retrocardiac region.  Bibasilar opacities are likely secondary to
 atelectasis and small pleural effusions.  There is no large mediastinal
 hemorrhage.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   Mild to moderate pulmonary edema and increasing moderate right pleural
 effusion due to biventricular heart failure and/or volume overload.  New left
 lower lobe collapse.
 
 2.  No large mediastinal hemorrhage.  If there is high clinical concern for
 aortic dissection, consider CTA for better evaluation
