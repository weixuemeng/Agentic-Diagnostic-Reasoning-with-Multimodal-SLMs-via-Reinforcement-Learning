                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with positional pain just under the left scapula. 
 Question mass.  Patient has had AVR and is on warfarin.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Heart is top normal to borderline enlarged, but pulmonary vasculature is
 unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  Lungs are
 well expanded and clear.  As far as one can tell from a conventional chest
 radiograph, the chest cage is normal, but the findings described are not
 really addressed by a conventional chest radiograph.  I would recommend CT
 scanning or at least detailed skeletal views of the regions of where the focal
 findings are.
