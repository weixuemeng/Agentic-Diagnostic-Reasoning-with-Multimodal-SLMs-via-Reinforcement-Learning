 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Pacemaker  // evaluate for lead position    
 evaluate for lead position
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs most recently ___.
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is new, accompanied by small
 bilateral pleural effusions, could be due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial
 effusion.  Pulmonary vascular engorgement is slightly more pronounced and
 there is a suggestion of borderline interstitial edema pointing to cardiac
 decompensation, but no mediastinal vascular engorgement to suggest volume
 overload.
 
 New transvenous right ventricular pacer lead follows the expected course to
 the ventricular apex.  There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.
