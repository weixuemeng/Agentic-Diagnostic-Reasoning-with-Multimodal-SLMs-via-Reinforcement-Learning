                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with 4 days of pleuritic chest pain
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Low lung volumes limits
 evaluation.  There is left lower lobe consolidation with associated volume
 loss, likely atelectasis though difficult to exclude a superimposed pneumonia.
 There is a small left pleural effusion.  There is mild right basal
 atelectasis.  Heart size is difficult to assess.  Mediastinal contour appears
 normal.  No pneumothorax.  No signs of edema.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis, difficult to exclude a superimposed left lower lobe
 pneumonia.  Small left pleural effusion.
