                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with ARDS secondary to pneumonia, status post PICC
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The tip of the left PICC projects over the
 expected location of the right atrium.  Recommend proximal repositioning by 4
 cm to the level of the cavoatrial junction.  The right internal jugular
 central venous catheter terminates at the low SVC, unchanged from prior. 
 Overall, aeration of the lungs appear improved from multiple recent prior
 examinations.  A confluent opacity within the right lung base persists and may
 be secondary to asymmetric pulmonary edema or aspiration/infection.  There is
 no large pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left PICC in the right atrium, proximal repositioning by 4 cm is
 recommended.
 
 2.  Improved lung parenchymal opacities with decreased edema.  Persistent
 consolidation in the right lower lobe may reflect asymmetric edema versus
 aspiration/infection.
 
 Dr. ___, communicated the PICC position and recommendations to
 ___ (IV RN) at 15:29 on ___ by telephone, 2 minutes after
 discovery.
