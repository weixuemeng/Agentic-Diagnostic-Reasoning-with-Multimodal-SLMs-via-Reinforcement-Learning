                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening dyspnea and wheezing after pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:   ___ as well as CT thoracic spine ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are well
 expanded with linear left lung opacity most consistent with atelectasis. 
 Rounded nodules seen in the left upper and lower lobes are better demonstrated
 on the recent thoracic spine CT as nodules with areas of central,
 benign-appearing calcification.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 The heart and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Lumbar fusion hardware
 is incompletely assessed. Old right rib fracture is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute intrathoracic process with left midlung opacity, most likely
 atelectasis.
