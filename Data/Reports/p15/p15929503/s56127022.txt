  Mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Coexisting infection at either lung base
  cannot be excluded given the limitations of this examination.  Dedicated PA
  and lateral radiographs could be considered for further evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with known CHF, here with dyspnea, weight gain  // ?
 pneumonia, ? pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe cardiomegaly appears increased compared to the prior examination. 
 Indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature suggest mild to moderate edema. 
 Limited evaluation, but apparent increased opacification of the lung bases may
 reflect edema, but infection is also a consideration.  Right greater than left
 pleural thickening appears similar compared to the prior examination.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are possible.  No pneumothorax.  A left pectoralis
 dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker and leads are unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Coexisting infection at either lung base
 cannot be excluded given the limitations of this examination.  Dedicated PA
 and lateral radiographs could be considered for further evaluation.
