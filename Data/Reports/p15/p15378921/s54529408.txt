 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Injury, low blood pressure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:45.

 left base atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is gaseous
 distention of the bowel underlying the left hemidiaphragm which is not well
 evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings with mild
 left base atelectasis and no definite focal consolidation.
 2.  Gaseous distention of the bowel underlying the left hemidiaphragm not well
 evaluated on this study.
