                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and high grade fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH, TWO VIEWS
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs
 are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Paradoxical
 lordosis in the lower thoracic spine is responsible for increasing density in
 the lower lung fields on the lateral view and this should not be confused with
 infected consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process; specifically, no evidence of
 pneumonia.
