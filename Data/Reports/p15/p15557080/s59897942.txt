                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:35 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with left pleural effusion after thoracentesis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion remains following thoracentesis and
 aspiration of the majority of the left pleural fluid.  Left hemidiaphragm is
 elevated, significance uncertain, but raising possibility of either primary
 atelectasis in the left lower lobe or pleural restriction, since there seems
 to be a posterior loculation of residual pleural fluid as well.  Mild
 interstitial edema which developed on ___ has improved, but there is a
 suggestion of a new region of consolidation at the right apex.  I would
 strongly recommend conventional radiographs as soon as feasible.
 
 Heart is moderately enlarged, its size exaggerated by difference in patient
 positioning and technique.
