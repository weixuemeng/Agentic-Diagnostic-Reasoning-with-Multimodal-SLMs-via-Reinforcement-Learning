                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post thoracocentesis for left pleural
 effusion.  Evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph performed approximately three hours prior to this
 exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Nearly total opacification of the left lung field is
 re-demonstrated, compatible with a large left-sided pleural effusion.  There
 are new diffuse interstitial opacities, with indistinctness of the right hilum
 suggesting pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change in size of left-sided pleural effusion. 
 Acute pulmonary edema.
