                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Possible stroke.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  Lungs are clear and the pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus posteriorly suggests a trace
 left pleural effusion.  No right-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are minimal degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Trace left pleural effusion.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
