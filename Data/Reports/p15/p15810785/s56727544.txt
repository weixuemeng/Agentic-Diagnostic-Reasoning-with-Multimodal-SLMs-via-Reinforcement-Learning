 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly
 increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation.  Borderline size of
 the cardiac silhouette.  Right pectoral Port-A-Cath persists.  No larger
 pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema, no pneumonia.  Minimal increase in
 radiodensity at the right lung apex might be caused by patient rotation.
