                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pelvic fractures, to assess for consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 change.  Continued blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  There is some
 increased opacification silhouetting the right hemidiaphragm.  This most
 likely reflects atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 superimposed consolidation would have to be considered.
