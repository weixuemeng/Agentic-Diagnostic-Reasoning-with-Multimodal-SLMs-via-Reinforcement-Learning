                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, allowing for marked
 differences and opaque shunt obliquity, there is probably little change and no
 definite acute focal pneumonia.  The left lung is well seen and shows no acute
 abnormality.  There is an area of increased opacification at the right base
 medially.  This could represent some atelectatic change or overlying hilar
 markings due to the obliquity.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle could
 reflect some small effusion.
