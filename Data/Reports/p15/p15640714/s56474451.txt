                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of pleuritic chest pain
 for weeks and rib pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Mild degenerative
 changes are seen along the spine.  There is questionable cortical stepoff at
 the lateral right fifth rib, concerning for fracture.  Difficult to exclude
 nondisplaced fractures of the right lateral fourth and third ribs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Apparent cortical step-off at the lateral right fifth rib raises
 concern for fracture.  Difficult to exclude nondisplaced fractures of the
 right lateral fourth and third ribs.  Recommend dedicated rib series for
 further evaluation.  
 
 No focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
