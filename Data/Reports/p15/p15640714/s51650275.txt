                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of pain on the right
 side, rule out rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 minimal basilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable and unremarkable.  Previously seen right-sided rib fractures are not as
 well appreciated on the current study.  If clinical concern for acute rib
 fracture persists, suggest dedicated rib series, which is more sensitive.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Previously seen right-sided rib fractures are better appreciated on the
 prior study; if clinical concern for acute rib fracture persists, suggest
 dedicated rib series, which is more sensitive.
