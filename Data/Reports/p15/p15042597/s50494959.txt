                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with  chest pain// evaluate for pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly underinflated, but grossly clear.  Prominence of the
 right infrahilar pulmonary vasculature is a stable finding, likely secondary
 to diminished lung volumes.  Heart size is top-normal, as before.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
 tortuous, a chronic finding.  Mediastinal contours are otherwise within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mildly underinflated lungs, but no evidence of pneumonia, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.
