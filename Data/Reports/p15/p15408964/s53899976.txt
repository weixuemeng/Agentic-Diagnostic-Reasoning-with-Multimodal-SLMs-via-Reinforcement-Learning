                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute onset dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 is minimal left lower lung scarring/atelectasis, decreased compared to the
 prior study.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There has been near-complete
 interval resolution of a small loculated left pleural effusion, with minimal
 residual pleural thickening/fluid along the lateral aspect of the left lower
 lung, best appreciated on the frontal projection.  There is no right pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Near-complete interval resolution of small loculated left pleural
 effusion.
