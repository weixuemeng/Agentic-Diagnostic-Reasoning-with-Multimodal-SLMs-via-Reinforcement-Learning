                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fatigue and recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is within
 normal limits.  There is streaky opacity in the left lower lobe with a small
 left pleural effusion noted.  The right lung is grossly clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left pleural effusion, a component of which is loculated
 laterally, with adjacent left lower lobe opacity, possibly reflecting
 pneumonia.  Continued followup examinations are recommended to ensure
 resolution of this finding after treatment.
