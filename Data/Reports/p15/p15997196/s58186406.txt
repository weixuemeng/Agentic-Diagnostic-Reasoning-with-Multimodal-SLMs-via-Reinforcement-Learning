                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 There is an increase in interstitial markings in a predominantly peripheral
 and basilar distribution consistent with known chronic interstitial lung
 disease which was previously presumed to reflect nonspecific interstitial
 pneumonia.  Increased opacities at the lung bases likely reflect this
 progressive fibrosis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 stable without cardiomegaly.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Progression of chronic interstitial lung disease.  Worsening opacities at the
 lung bases likely reflect progression of disease however underlying infection
 is difficult to exclude.
