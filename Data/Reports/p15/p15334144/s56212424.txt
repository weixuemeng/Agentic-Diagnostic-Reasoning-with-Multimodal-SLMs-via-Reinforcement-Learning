                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with hypertrophic
 obstructive cardiomyopathy after pulseless electrical activity arrest with
 transvenous pacer placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The patient continues to be intubated with the ET tube tip being 2.2 cm above
 the carina.  The transjugular pacemaker lead terminates in the expected
 location of the left ventricle.  The cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  There
 is improved aeration of the right lung, consistent with gradual improvement of
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is present.  Old rib fracture on the left is
 noted.
