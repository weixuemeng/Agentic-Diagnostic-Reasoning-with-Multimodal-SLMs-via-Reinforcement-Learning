                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fatigue.
 
 Comparison radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart
 is moderately enlarged. Pulmonary vasculature, including the hila, is more
 engorged, but there is no edema or pleural effusion. A large hiatal hernia is
 chronic.  There is no pneumothorax. Rightward tracheal deviation, more
 pronounced today, is probably due to an enlarging goiter. A mild wedge
 compression deformity of a midthoracic vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Moderate cardiomegaly, borderline decompensation. Large, growing
 goiter. Moderate hiatal hernia.
