                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a large hiatal hernia with air-fluid levels seen. Left basilar
 opacity may in part be due to adjacent atelectasis however, there is concern
 for a small pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation not excluded. Right basilar opacity is most likely due to
 atelectasis. No right pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The
 aorta is calcified. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess due to the
 large hiatal hernia, but may be mildly enlarged. No overt pulmonary edema is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large hiatal hernia. Left basilar opacity may in part be due to atelectasis
 adjacent to the hernia however there is concern for left pleural effusion with
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle and overlying atelectasis with
 possible left basilar consolidation.  Recommend followup to resolution and
 comparison with any prior studies.
