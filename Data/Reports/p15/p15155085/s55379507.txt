                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with uncontrolled hypertension
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient rotation and the patient's neck obscuring the
 left apex.  Heart size appears moderately enlarged accounting for limitations
 in technique. There is diffuse calcification of the aorta. Mediastinal contour
 is difficult to assess given the degree of rotation, but does not appear
 substantially changed from the previous study. Mild pulmonary edema is
 present.  Small left pleural effusion may be minimally increased in size
 compared to the prior study. A small right pleural effusion is also likely
 present.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis but infection
 is not excluded. No pneumothorax is identified. There are moderate
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly increased
 in size compared to the prior study. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
