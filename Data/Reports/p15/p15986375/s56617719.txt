                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough for one month.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  There are interstitial
 opacities noted in both lower lobes, in particular in the right lower lobe
 that might reflect atypical infection or interstitial process.  Correlation
 with chest CT is recommended if clinically warranted.
 
 There is also questionable nodular opacity in the right lower lobe projecting
 just above the diaphragm, 8 mm in diameter and can be re-assessed on the chest
 CT as well.
