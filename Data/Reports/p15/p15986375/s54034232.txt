                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  Allowing for this factor, heart is upper limits
 of normal in size.  No confluent areas of consolidation are observed, and
 there are no pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite pneumonia, but assessment of lung bases is limited by
 low lung volumes.  Repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory level may be
 helpful in this regard if warranted clinically.
