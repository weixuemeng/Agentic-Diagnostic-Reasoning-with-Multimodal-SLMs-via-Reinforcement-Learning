                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Found hanging.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Underlying trauma board and the external artifact partially obscure
 the view.  The right lower lateral hemithorax is not fully included on the
 image.  Given this, what appears to be an endotracheal tube is high in
 position, terminating approximately 7.9 cm above the level of the carina and
 above the level of the clavicles.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  High-lying endotracheal tube, as above.  Recommend repositioning.
