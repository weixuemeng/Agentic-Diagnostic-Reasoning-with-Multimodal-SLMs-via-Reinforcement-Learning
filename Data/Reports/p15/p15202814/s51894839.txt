                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New O2 requirement.  Question worsening infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 There is marked kyphotic positioning.  Lung volumes are probably slightly
 lower compared with the film from ___.  Again seen is a dual-lead
 pacemaker, with lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle.  Evidence of
 prior sternotomy, with mediastinal clips.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette,
 probably unchanged.  
 
 There is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, probably with a small
 left effusion.  This is similar, possibly slightly worse, compared with the
 prior film.  There is minimal atelectasis at the right base, which is also
 slightly worse.  Vascular markings appear similar.  No definite CHF.  No
 right-sided consolidation or gross right effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung volumes, but overall similar to the prior film. 
 Possible slight worsening in the degree of consolidation at the left base and
 slightly more atelectasis at the right base.
