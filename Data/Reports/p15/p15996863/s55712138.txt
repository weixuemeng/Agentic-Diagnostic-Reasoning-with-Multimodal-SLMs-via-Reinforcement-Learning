                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with right pleural effusion, post-right
 sided thoracocentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains within normal limits.
 Similar as identified on previous examination, there exists extensive
 pericardial calcifications surrounding the ventricular contours, but excluding
 the atrial wall areas.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  Slightly
 prominent azygos vein suggests elevated venous pressure.  This existed already
 on the previous study.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There
 exists now a moderate amount of pleural effusion on the right base that
 obliterates the lateral pleural sinus and obscures the peripheral half of the
 right-sided diaphragm.  The fluid extends along the right lateral chest wall
 and reaches the minor fissure.  When the lateral views are compared, increase
 of pleural density in the posterior pleural sinus and along the posterior
 pleural space has increased markedly and the amount must now be considered to
 be moderate.  As the films were obtained following a recent thoracocentesis,
 it can be assumed that the right-sided pleural effusion was markedly increased
 since the preoperative chest examination of ___.  Comparison with
 the most recent chest CT of ___, indicates that the present
 pleural effusion has a similar extension at that time.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax status post right-sided
 thoracocentesis.  Pleural effusion similar to what was present on chest CT of
 ___.
