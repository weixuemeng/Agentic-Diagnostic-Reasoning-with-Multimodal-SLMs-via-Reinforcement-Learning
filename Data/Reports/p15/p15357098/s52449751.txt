                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with CHF and renal failure.  Dyspnea, r/o CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes related low.  Bibasilar opacities are likely due to atelectasis,
 but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Heart size appears normal, and
 there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Chronic left rib deformities, as
 seen on the prior CT and radiograph, are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Basilar opacities are likely due to atelectasis, however in the correct
 clinical setting, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
