                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with aspiration of a foreign body.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiograph from earlier today (___ at
 12:20 a.m.).
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable frontal upright view of the chest was obtained.  In
 comparison to the prior study, there is increased aeration of the left lung;
 however dense consolidation persists.  Lung volumes remain low.  Opacities in
 the right cardiophrenic angle are largely unchanged and may reflect
 atelectasis or consolidation. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left lung consolidation, mildly improved. 
 2.  Persistent low lung volumes.
 
 2.  Bilateral subsegmental atelectasis.
