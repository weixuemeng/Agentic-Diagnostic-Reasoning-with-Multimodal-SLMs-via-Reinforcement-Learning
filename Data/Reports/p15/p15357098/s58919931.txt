 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  Minimal pleural-parenchymal scarring is noted at
 the lung apices.  Streaky atelectasis at the left lung base is noted. There is
 otherwise no focal consolidation.  Pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Incidental note is made of fusion of
