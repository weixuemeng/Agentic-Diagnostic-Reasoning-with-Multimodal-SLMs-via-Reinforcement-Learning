                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pericardial effusion, tachycardia  // Acute
 cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ CT dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates a left supraclavicular central
 venous dialysis catheter, its tip in similar position relative to prior study
 performed ___, probable mid superior vena cava.  Lung volumes are
 low, similar to prior examination.  Bibasilar atelectasis is moderate. 
 Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles is suggestive of small pleural
 effusions bilaterally.  Lingular opacity appears slightly more conspicuous
 relative to prior study worrisome for infectious process in the correct
 clinical setting.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear grossly similar
 to prior study.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no evidence of pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lingular opacity appears slightly more conspicuous relative to prior
 examination which in the appropriate clinical setting would be worrisome for
 infectious process.  Atelectasis and superimposed shadows are however
 alternative etiologies.
