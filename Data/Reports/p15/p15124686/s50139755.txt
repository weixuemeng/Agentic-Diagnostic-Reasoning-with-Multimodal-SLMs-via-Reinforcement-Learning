                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, chills, dry cough.  History of necrotizing pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Again demonstrated within the left lower lobe is a triangular area of
 opacification which appears improved compared to the prior exam, likely the
 residua of prior necrotizing pneumonia.  Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic sulcus may suggest chronic pleural thickening or fluid.  No new
 areas of focal consolidation otherwise demonstrated.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Triangular area of opacification in the left lower lobe likely reflects
 sequela of prior necrotizing pneumonia, and is improved compared to the prior
 radiograph.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to chronic
 pleural thickening or trace fluid.  No new areas of focal consolidation are
 demonstrated to suggest pneumonia.
