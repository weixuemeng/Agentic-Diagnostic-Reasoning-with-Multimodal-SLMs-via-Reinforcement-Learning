                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with history of pneumonia.  // Follow up
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   ___ and ___ chest radiographs, and
 chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A wedge-shaped left lower lobe opacity in the retrocardiac region is slightly
 decreased in size compared to chest radiograph of ___, and is
 accompanied by adjacent linear opacity extending to the lung periphery.
 Minimal blunting of left costophrenic sulcus is unchanged and probably
 reflects pleural thickening. Right lung and right pleural surfaces are clear,
 and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Scoliosis is incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe parenchymal abnormalities are likely the sequela of previous
 necrotizing left lower lobe pneumonia. However, if the patient is experiencing
 recurrent infections or recent respiratory symptoms, CT may be considered to
 more fully evaluate the lung parenchyma and airways in this region if
 warranted clinically.
