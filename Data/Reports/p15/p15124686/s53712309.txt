                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with left lower lobe
 necrotizing pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and ___.
 
 There is still presence of left lower lobe consolidation with potential some
 degree of volume loss.  The opacity is noted on both PA and lateral view.  As
 compared to ___, there is interval improvement in the extent of
 opacification though with currently no definitive evidence of accompanying
 effusion.  Rest of the lungs are clear.  There is presence of scoliosis.
 
 Given the location of the consolidation, a possibility of sequestration is
 present.  Correlation with past medical history and prior imaging might be
 considered and if clinically suspected, correlation with CTA of the chest
 would be reasonable.
