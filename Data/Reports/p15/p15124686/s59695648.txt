                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Previously visualized tiny left pneumothorax is not longer visualized. 
 Increasing opacity in the right lower lobe is likely atelectasis.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions larger on the left side are stable.  Left lower lobe
 consolidation is unchanged.  Left pleural drain is in place.
