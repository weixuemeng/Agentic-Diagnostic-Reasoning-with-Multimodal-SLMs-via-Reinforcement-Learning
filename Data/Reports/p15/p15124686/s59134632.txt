                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Necrotizing pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, left pigtail catheter remains in
 place and there is again no evidence of pneumothorax.  Extensive opacification
 of the left mid and lower zone again reflect some combination of pneumonia and
 pleural effusion with probable volume loss in the left lower lung.  Continued
 opacification at the right base consistent with consolidation and pleural
 effusion.
