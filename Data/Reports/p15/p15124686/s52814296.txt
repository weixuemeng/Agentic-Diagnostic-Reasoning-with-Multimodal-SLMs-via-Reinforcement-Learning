                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large left pleural effusion has increased in size since the prior
 chest radiograph and is accompanied by extensive consolidation within the
 lingula and left lower lobe.  Patchy consolidation at the right base is new
 since the prior chest x-ray, but progressive since more recent CT of ___.  Small right pleural effusion is new since the prior chest x-ray,
 but slightly increased since more recent CT exam.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is displaced more to the right compared to the prior
 study, likely due to mass effect by the effusion, but small pericardial
 effusion is also noted on recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Worsening multifocal pneumonia accompanied by enlarging pleural effusions,
 left greater than right.
