  There are low lung volumes and a suboptimal inspiratory effort.  There is
  moderate to severe cardiomegaly.  There is a tortuous thoracic aorta. 
  Tracheal and bronchial wall calcifications are a common finding in elderly
  patients.  A 4.2 cm lucency in the right lower lung is consistent with known
  emphysematous bulla, better assessed on prior CT chest from ___. 
  Retrocardiac opacity likely represents basilar atelectasis.  Right basilar
  opacities are similar in appearance to prior exams, consistent with basilar
  atelectasis around large emphysematous bullae.  There is no focal lung
  consolidation.  No pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax.

 EXAMINATION:
 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:
 ___ year old woman with acute SOB, tachypnea  // eval for pulm edema,
 aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest single view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 There are low lung volumes .  There is moderate  cardiomegaly. There is a
 tortuous thoracic aorta. Tracheal and bronchial wall calcifications are again
 visualized.  A 4.2 cm lucency in the right lower lung is consistent with known
 emphysematous bulla, better assessed on prior CT chest from ___.
 Retrocardiac opacity likely represents basilar atelectasis. Right basilar
 opacities is slightly increased compared to to prior exams, consistent with
 basilar atelectasis around large emphysematous bullae. There is no focal lung
 consolidation. No pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax.
