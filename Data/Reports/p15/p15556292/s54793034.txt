  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Chronic changes as detailed above.
  Nodular opacity projecting over the left mid lung, potentially within the
  overlying bones.  When patient is amenable, PA and lateral suggested for
  evaluation of possible underlying pulmonary nodule.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with sob  // ?pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is hyperinflation with increased interstitial markings throughout the
 lungs which are most suggestive of a chronic interstitial process.  Linear
 right basilar opacity is unchanged and likely due to scarring with adjacent
 emphysematous changes.  Nodular opacity projects over the left mid lung not
 clearly identified on prior.  Enlar cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.
 No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Chronic changes as detailed above.
 Nodular opacity projecting over the left mid lung, potentially within the
 overlying bones.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:
 When patient is amenable, PA and lateral suggested for evaluation of possible
 underlying pulmonary nodule.
