                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Chronic rightward shift of the mediastinal
 structures appears unchanged since before ___.  The patient is status
 post right lower lobectomy.  Chronic collapse of the residual right lung is
 redemonstrated with marked bronchiectatic changes.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears unchanged.  There is mild vascular congestion.  New
 increased opacity over the lower portion of the left lung could represent
 consolidation but more likly a layering pleural effusion.  A pleural effusion
 is also suspected on the right.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Suspected pleural effusions.  A developing parenchymal opacity at the left
 lung base is not excluded; short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful to
 reassess.
