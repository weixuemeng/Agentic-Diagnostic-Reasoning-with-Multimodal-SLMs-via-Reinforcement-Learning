 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion is much smaller following thoracentesis. No
 pneumothorax.  Heterogeneous opacification of the left lower lobe is either
 atelectasis or pneumonia.  Mediastinal shift due to prior right upper
 lobectomy and chronic midline lower lobe collapse is long-standing.
 
 ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard placements. A right PIC line ends
 low in the SVC.
