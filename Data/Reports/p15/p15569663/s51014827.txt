                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MS, dementia, epilepsy, intubated for airway protection
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 There is markedly rotated positioning.  An ET tube is present.  The tip lies
 above the medial clavicular head, relatively high.  It probably lies
 approximately 6.4 cm above the carina.  
 
 The cardiac silhouette is not well delineated due to rotation, and it projects
 over the right chest.  As a result, the lower right lung is obscured. 
 However, there also appears to be some pleural fluid or thickening tracking
 along the right chest wall into the right apex, not fully evaluated.  There is
 some patchy opacity at the left base with obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm and probably some parenchymal airspace change in the mid and
 lower zones, better seen on the prior film.  Some nodular densities in left
 upper zone are also likely present, better seen on today's film, but probably
 without significant change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube tip lies above the level of the clavicular heads.  Clinical
 correlation to assess for possible advancement of approximately 2.5 cm is
 requested.
 2.  Probable background COPD with opacities in the left mid and lower zones
 and possible opacification of the right lung with suspected bilateral
 effusions.  Allowing for rotation, the possibility of rightward shift of the
 mediastinum is suspected.  (Rightward shift of the mediastinum was shown on
 targeted review of the chest CT from ___.)
