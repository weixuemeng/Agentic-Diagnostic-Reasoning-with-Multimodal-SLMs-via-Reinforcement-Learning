                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  DKA.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle right
 base patchy opacity is seen, which could be due to overlapping structures or
 could be due to small foci of consolidation.  The left lung is clear.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle patchy right base opacities could be due to small foci of
 infection versus overlap of structures.
