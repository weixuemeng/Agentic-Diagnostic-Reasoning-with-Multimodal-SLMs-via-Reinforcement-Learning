                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation
 presents with rapid ventricular rate and CHF exacerbation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, thoracic spine radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is at least moderately enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Mild pulmonary edema is noted, worse in
 the interval.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present with
 bibasilar airspace opacities, most likely reflective of atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Percutaneous catheter is noted with pigtail in
 the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  Left PICC tip now appears to be
 flipped, likely within the azygos.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities, likely compressive atelectasis.  Infection is not
 excluded.
 2. PICC tip appears to be flipped in the interval, potentially within the
 azygos.  This can be confirmed with a lateral view.
