                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH, PORTABLE AP.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with intubated head bleedlast // Eval ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior imaging is available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis contributes to retrocardiac consolidation. 
 Opacity in the left upper lobe is also noted, possibly also due to
 atelectasis.  There is elevation of the left mainstem bronchus.  The right
 lung is grossly clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates above the level of the thoracic inlet, with
 hyperinflation of the cuff in the expected region of the larynx.  Partially
 visualized right shoulder arthroplasty is noted.  An esophageal catheter
 terminates in the stomach.  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal vascular
 clips appear intact.  The heart is mildly enlarged.
 
 Bilateral rib fractures are identified, some of which are chronic and some may
 be acute on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left lower lobe collapse.
 2. Malpositioned endotracheal tube above the thoracic inlet.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The malpositioned endotracheal tube was subsequently
 repositioned and a follow-up chest x-ray was obtained prior to the
 interpretation of this examination.  Therefore, no notification was necessary.
