                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubated, ?pna  // int change      int
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of the ET tube is between 2 and 3 cm from the carina.  Transesophageal
 drainage tube passes into a nondistended stomach and out of view.  Right
 jugular large-bore catheter ends in the upper SVC.  No associated mediastinal
 widening.
 
 Between ___ and ___ there was a substantial increase in moderate right
 pleural effusion and the development of pulmonary edema and progressive
 worsening of bibasilar consolidation.  Pulmonary vascular congestion has
 decreased over night and right pleural effusion is smaller.  Given the very
 low lung volumes present throughout this hospitalization, it is hard to say
 whether bibasilar consolidation is atelectasis and dependent edema or
 concurrent pneumonia.  Upper lungs are clear of consolidation.  Heart is
 moderately enlarged.
