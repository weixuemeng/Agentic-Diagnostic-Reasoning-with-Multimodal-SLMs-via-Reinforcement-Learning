                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with pancytopenia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette without vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  On the
 lateral view, there is increased opacification in the retrocardiac region. 
 This is difficult to identify on the frontal view, though in the appropriate
 clinical setting, a developing pneumonia must be considered.
