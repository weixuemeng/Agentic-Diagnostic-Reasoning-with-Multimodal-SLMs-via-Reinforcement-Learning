                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New onset left facial droop and left upper extremity weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is diffusely
 calcified.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no overt
 pulmonary edema is present.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. 
 Hazy opacification in the retrocardiac region may reflect atelectasis though
 infection cannot be excluded.  There is likely a moderate hiatal hernia. 
 Biapical scarring with calcifications is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Small bilateral pleural effusions with hazy retrocardiac opacity, possibly
 atelectasis though infection is not excluded.
 
 2. Possible moderate size hiatal hernia, which could be better assessed with a
 lateral radiograph.
