 Portable AP upright chest film, ___, at 10:36 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits given portable technique.  In
 the right infrahilar region is a suggestion of a 2.5-cm cavitary lesion,
 although this may be related to confluence of vascular shadows.  Therefore,
 followup imaging with PA and lateral views would be advised.  The left
 hemidiaphragm is elevated, of uncertain significance.  There are streaky
 interstitial opacities in both lungs which may reflect smoking-related changes
 or small airways disease.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No pneumothorax
 or pleural effusions.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Right coronary stent
 is in place.  Results were conveyed to ___, the unit coordinator on Farr
 9, on ___ at 11:32 at the time of discovery as the patient's nurse was
 unavailable.
