                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with question right infrahilar cavitary
 lesion.  Assess for sources of fever.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest are submitted dated ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable cardiac
 and mediastinal contours.  The questioned cavitary lesion in the right
 infrahilar region on the most recent study does not persist and therefore is
 felt to have reflected confluence of vascular shadows.  Minimal blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle suggests chronic pleural thickening or a tiny
 effusion.  The left hemidiaphragm remains slightly elevated of uncertain
 significance.  No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. 
 If the patient's symptoms of fever persist, followup imaging should be
 considered.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  A right
 coronary stent remains in place.
