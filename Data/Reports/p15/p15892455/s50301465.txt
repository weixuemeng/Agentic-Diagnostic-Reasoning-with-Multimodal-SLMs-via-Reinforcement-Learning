                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Delirium, evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low, leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is
 seen.  Stable, moderate to severe cardiomegaly is noted.  The aorta is
 tortuous and contains atherosclerotic calcifications.  Mediastinal contours
 are otherwise stable.  Redemonstrated is a metallic density seen projecting
 over the heart, which may relate to a prior cardiac surgery.  A left
 ventriculoperitoneal shunt is noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
