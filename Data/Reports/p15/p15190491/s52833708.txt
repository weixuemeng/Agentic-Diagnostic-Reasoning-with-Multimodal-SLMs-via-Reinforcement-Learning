 INDICATION:  History of CHF with aortic valve replacement.  Evaluate for acute
 cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As before, the patient is status post midline sternotomy and aortic
 valve replacement.  A trace right pleural effusion is substantially decreased
 compared to the prior study from ___.  A previously seen small
 left pleural effusion has resolved.  There is bilateral lower lung
 atelectasis.  Linear atelectasis versus fissural fluid is seen at the right
 lung base.  There is mild cephalization without frank interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly is not significantly changed.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is not significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Pulmonary vascular congestion without frank interstitial edema.
 
 2.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Trace right pleural effusion, decreased in size compared to the prior
 study from ___.  Interval resolution of small left pleural
