                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with diffuse >___% erthema migrans / purpura fulminans type
 rash. Evaluate for atypical pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is hazy opacity at the bases bilaterally, possibly due to
 superimposition of soft tissues of the chest wall. The cardiac, hilar and
 mediastinal contours are normal.No pleural abnormality is seen.  Mildly
 elevated left hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased hazy opacities at the lung bases bilaterally possibly due to
 superimposition of soft tissues of the chest wall.  Lateral radiograph may be
 helpful to further evaluate the lungs in order to exclude a basilar pneumonia.
