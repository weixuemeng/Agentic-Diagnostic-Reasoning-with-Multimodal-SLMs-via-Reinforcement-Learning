                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle
 patchy left lower lobe opacity could represent atelectasis; however,
 underlying infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  The
 right lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable subtle focal left lower lobe opacity could be due to
 atelectasis or infection.
