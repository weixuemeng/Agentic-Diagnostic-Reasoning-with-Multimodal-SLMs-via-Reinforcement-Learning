                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever, eval for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest upright AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is calcified, indicating atherosclerosis. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  The lungs are hyperexpanded and there is flattening of the
 diaphragms, best seen on the lateral radiograph.  Increased opacity projecting
 over the posterior lung bases on the lateral view, potentially atelectasis or
 chronic interstitial markings.  Infection would be difficult to exclude. 
 Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.  Multilevel degenerative change of the visualized
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle increased opacity projecting over the posterior lung bases on the
 lateral view, potentially atelectasis or chronic interstitial markings.
 Infection would be difficult to exclude.
