                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with shortness of breath increase o2 requirement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and ___ as
 well as a CT PA chest from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   A large retrocardiac opacity
 containing foci of gas may represent a large hiatal hernia though this would
 be new from the prior imaging studies.  Left lower lobe opacity may represent
 pneumonia.  Small pleural effusions are seen, left greater than right.  A hazy
 opacity in the right lower lung is indeterminate.  Small nodules project over
 the upper lungs which are new from the prior study.  Heart size cannot be
 assessed.  No large pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large retrocardiac density which may in part reflect the presence of a hiatal
 hernia though consolidation in the lower lungs concerning for pneumonia with
 small pleural effusions.  Nodules project over the upper lungs which require
