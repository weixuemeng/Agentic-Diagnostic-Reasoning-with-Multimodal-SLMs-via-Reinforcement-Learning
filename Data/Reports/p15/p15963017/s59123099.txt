                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea on exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated along with marked
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are similar with unchanged enlargement of the pulmonary arteries suggestive of
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Focal opacity in the left upper lobe along the fissure is unchanged,
 compatible with platelike atelectasis.  Patchy bilateral lower lobe opacities
 also likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized. 
 Exaggerated kyphosis of the thoracic spine is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis and unchanged platelike atelectasis in the left upper
 lobe.
