 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post cardiac arrest, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 new right internal jugular vein catheter.  The course of the catheter is
 unremarkable, the tip of the catheter projects over the lower SVC.  The
 nasogastric tube is also newly placed, the tip projects over the distal parts
 of the stomach.  The position of the endotracheal tube is unchanged. 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  The massive bilateral parenchymal opacities
 are slightly improved as compared to the previous image, likely due to
 increased ventilatory pressure.  No larger pleural effusions.
