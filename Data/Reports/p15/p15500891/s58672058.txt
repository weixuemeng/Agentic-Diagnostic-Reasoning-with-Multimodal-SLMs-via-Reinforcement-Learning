                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with a history of emphysema,
 now presenting with dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal lateral chest radiographs demonstrate multiple intact sternal wires. 
 A fiducial marker in a known right lower lobe nodule is again seen, not well
 evaluated on chest radiograph.  Cardiac size is normal and the lungs
 hyperinflated.  The descending aorta appears slightly larger in caliber
 compared to ___.  A retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of the
 lateral left hemidiaphragm may be secondary to overlapping hilar structures,
 given slight patient rotation.  However, pneumonia is also a consideration. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Subtle retrocardiac opacity on lateral radiograph, potentially due to
 overlap of normal structures due to oblique positioning.  If there remains
 clinical suspicion for pneumonia, repeat radiograph with improved positioning
 would be helpful.
 2. Right lower lobe neoplastic nodule with fiducial marker in place.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Updated recommendations were communicated via telephone by Dr.
 ___ to Dr. ___ at 08:14 on ___, upon attending review.
