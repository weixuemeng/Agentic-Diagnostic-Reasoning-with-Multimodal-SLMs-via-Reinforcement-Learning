                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an improvement of
 transparency of the lungs reflecting a decrease in extent of the pre-existing
 mild fluid overload.  No new parenchymal opacity, in particular no evidence of
 pneumonia.  Moderate cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and
 bilateral hilar enlargement persists.  No pleural effusions.
