 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:31 PM
  Patient rotation alters the normal anatomic landmarks.  Heterogeneous right
  lower lung opacities are increased compared to the study from ___, possibly atelectasis, although infection is certainly possible.  A
  curvilinear lucency is seen along the medial aspect of the left lung apex,
  concerning for a tiny pneumothorax ; further assessment with a dedicated
  upright well-centered radiograph is recommended.  The endotracheal tube ends
  5.7 cm above the level of the carina.  An enteric catheter passes below the
  level of the diaphragm and out of the field-of-view inferiorly.  A left
  subclavian central venous catheter likely ends in the upper SVC.  Findings
  were discussed Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 21:31 via telephone on the day
  of the study, 2 minutes after discovery.
