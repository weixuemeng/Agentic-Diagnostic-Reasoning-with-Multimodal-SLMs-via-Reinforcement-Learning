                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with tobacco use and chronic cough for several
 months.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower, exaggerating what may be a mild increase in cardiac
 size, still not pathologically enlarged.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 engorgement, edema, or pleural effusion.  Lungs are clear of any focal
 abnormality.  Atherosclerotic calcification in the thoracic aorta is
 relatively mild.
 
 There is slight indentation in the right wall of the trachea at the thoracic
 inlet which may be an indication of a right thyroid nodule or alternatively an
 impression made by a crossing artery.  Clinical correlation advised.
