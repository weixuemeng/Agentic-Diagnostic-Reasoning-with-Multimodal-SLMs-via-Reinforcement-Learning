                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged with diffuse
 atherosclerotic calcification of the thoracic aorta noted.  Hilar contours are
 similar with enlargement of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally suggestive of
 underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Severe bullous emphysema is seen
 with large bulla noted most pronounced in the right lung base.  Patchy opacity
 within the left upper lobe is new in the interval which may reflect an area of
 infection though underlying neoplasm cannot be excluded.  Patchy opacity in
 the left lung base may also reflect an additional area of infection or
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.  Surgical anchor is noted in the right humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Marked bullous emphysema.
 2. Patchy left upper lobe opacity, new in the interval, may reflect infection,
 however underlying neoplasm cannot be excluded.  Additional patchy left lower
 lobe opacity may reflect additional site of infection or atelectasis. 
 Followup radiographs after treatment are recommended, and if the finding in
 the left upper lobe persists, dedicated chest CT is suggested.
 3. Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
