                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough status post chemo.  Please evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Opacities at the right mid lung and right base are worse,
 especially at the base.  Multiple other cavitary nodules in both lobes are
 better demonstrated on recent CT but are grossly similar in number.  There is
 likely small right pleural effusion.  There is no cardiomegaly.  Bilateral
 hilar fullness is compatible with known mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening opacities in the right lung compatible with known
 conglomerate masses. Given the degree of change at the base over a relatively
 short time period, findings are worrisome for new pneumonia.
