                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with slurred speech.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is no confluent consolidation. 
 There are however mildly prominent interstitial markings in the lungs
 bilaterally.  The cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged and the aorta is
 tortuous.  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted.  There is
 mild wedge deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body.  Osseous structures
 are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mildly increased interstitial markings in the lungs may be due to chronic
 underlying disease versus mild interstitial edema.
 
 Mild wedge deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body, age indeterminate and
 clinical correlation recommended.
