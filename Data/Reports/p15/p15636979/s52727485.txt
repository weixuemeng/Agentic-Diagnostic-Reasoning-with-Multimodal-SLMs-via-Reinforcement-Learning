                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Renal cell carcinoma after radical nephrectomy.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  There is new opacity in the
 left upper lung projecting over the inferior edge of the second rib, not seen
 on the prior study.  It potentially can reflect infectious process or
 summation of vessels but given the patient's history, assessment with chest CT
 is required.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
