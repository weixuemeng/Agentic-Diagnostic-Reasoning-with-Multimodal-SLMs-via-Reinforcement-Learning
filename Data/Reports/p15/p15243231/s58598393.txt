                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Hypotension. Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated. Single portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph
 demonstrates hypoinflated lungs. Heterogeneous opacity within the right lower
 lobe is most consistent with atelectasis however differential includes
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Persistent mild cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal contour and hila are
 unremarkable.  Calcified tortuous aorta is again noted.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Heterogeneous right lower lobe opacity is most consistent with atelectasis
 however differential includes pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Persistent mild cardiomegaly.
