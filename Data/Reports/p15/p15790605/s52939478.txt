                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with large mediastinal mass, s/p
 mediastinoscopy, with oxygen requirement  // evaluate for pneumothorax,
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest PA and lateral ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.  Atelectatic changes are seen at the
 left lung base in the setting of increased stomach distention and elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm.
 Pneumonia cannot be excluded in the left lung.  The right lung is clear.  No
 other changes are seen compared to prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.  Increased distention of the stomach and
 atelectasis of the left lung makes it difficult to exclude a pneumonia.
