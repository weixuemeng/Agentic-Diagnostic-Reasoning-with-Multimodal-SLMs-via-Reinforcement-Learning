                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Nausea, presyncopal episode, history of CHF, assess for
 pulmonary edema or cardiomegaly.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  AP technique limits
 evaluation for cardiomegaly, though the heart does appear to be top normal in
 size.  No signs of CHF/pulmonary edema.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  No definite signs of pneumonia.  A vague nodular opacity projects over
 the left upper lung which could represents an artifact, though a pulmonary
 nodule not excluded.  Bony structures are intact.  Degenerative changes are
 partially imaged in the T-spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam, with top normal heart size.  Possible nodule in the
 left upper lung.  Dedicated PA and lateral views may be obtained to better
 asses.
