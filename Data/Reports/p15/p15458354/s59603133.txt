                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with syncope
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, stable when compared to prior radiograph dated ___. 
 Bilateral asymmetric pleural thickening, right greater than left, which
 appears similar in appearance to prior study obtained ___ years prior and
 preserved in ratio. No focal opacity is seen which is convincing for
 pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion.  Osseous structures demonstrate no
 acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetric bilapical pleural thickening, right greater than left, which
 appears preserved in ratio relative to prior study obtained ___ years ago. 
 This is felt likely to reflect pleural-parenchymal scarring.  If, however,
 referable symptomatology exists clinically, a dedicated CT for further
 evaluation should be obtained.
