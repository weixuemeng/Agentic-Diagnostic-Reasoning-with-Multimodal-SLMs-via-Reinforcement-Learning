                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Mechanical fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  This
 accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely within normal
 limits.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures. Minimal patchy opacity in lung bases likely
 reflects atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Streaky
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis, though infection
 cannot be excluded.  No evidence of acute traumatic injury.
