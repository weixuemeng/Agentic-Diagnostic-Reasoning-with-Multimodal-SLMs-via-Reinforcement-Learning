                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  There may be right middle lobe atelectasis.  No
 displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings with possible
 mild right mid lobe atelectasis.
