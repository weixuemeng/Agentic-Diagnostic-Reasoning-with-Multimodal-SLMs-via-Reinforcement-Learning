                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 multifocal opacities in both lungs, particularly in the right mid-to-lower
 lung fields, involving the right upper lobe and superior aspect of the lower
 lobes.  No pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pulmonary opacities bilaterally predominantly
 involving the upper and lower lobes, worrisome for multifocal pneumonia. 
 Recommend followup to resolution.
