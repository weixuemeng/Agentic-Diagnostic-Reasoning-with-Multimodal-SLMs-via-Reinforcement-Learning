                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension, bilateral pneumothorax, question esophageal tear.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 2.9 cm above
 the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip overlying the fundus.  The NGT
 sideport lies at or immediately above the level of the GE junction.  A left
 subclavian central line is present, tip over distal SVC.  There are bilateral
 chest tubes. Compared with the earlier film, the right-sided chest tube side
 port has advanced slightly, now overlying the lateral chest wall. No obvious
 pneumothorax is identified on the single view.  Scattered subcutaneous
 emphysema is present.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, with atelectasis at both bases.  On the
 right, the degree of patchy opacity has increased compared with ___ at
 4:03 a.m.  On the left, retrocardiac density and minimal opacity laterally is
 essentially unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Bilateral chest tubes.  No obvious pneumothorax.  The right chest tube
 side port now overlies the lateral chest wall.
 
 2.  Mediastinal contour unchanged.  No pneumomediastinum identified.
 
 3.  Patchy opacity both bases, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation.
