  New peripheral left mid-lung opacity and persistent bibasilar opacities could
  represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Indistinct pulmonary
  vascular markings are compatible with pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax. -

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dementia, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is
 extensive respiratory motion that degrades the image.  Apparent increase in
 opacification in the left mid and lower lung zones is worrisome for pneumonia
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  Volume loss in the left lower lobe with
 pleural effusion is probably present.  
 
 Although the pulmonary vessels are not optimally seen, there is evidence of
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Monitoring and support devices are
 essentially unchanged.
