                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothoraces and subcutaneous emphysema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position approximately 2.9 cm above the
 carina.  An NG tube is present, tip overlying fundus. A left subclavian
 central line is present, tip over distal SVC.  Two chest tubes are present,
 one on the left, one on the right.  Of note, the right-sided chest tube side
 port lies immediately outside the thorax.  
 
 There is possible slight leftward shift of the mediastinum.  There is
 increased opacity at the left lung base, consistent with collapse and/or
 consolidation, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  Diffuse pulmonary
 vascular plethora and scattered atelectasis is present in both lungs.  No
 pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum is identified on the current film. 
 Scattered subcutaneous emphysema is present bilaterally.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes as described.  Of note, the sideport of the right chest
 tube lies outside the chest wall.
 2.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 3.  No pneumothorax identified at present.  Subcutaneous emphysema noted.
