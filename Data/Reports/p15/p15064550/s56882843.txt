                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy is midline.  There are low lung volumes, with basilar
 atelectasis.  No definite infiltrate. No CHF or gross effusion. Minimal
 blunting of left costophrenic angle is likely present. Mild prominence of the
 cardiac silhouette is likely accentuated by low lung volumes. No widening of
 the superior mediastinum is detected.  Small metallic densities overlying the
 lower mediastinum on the AP view are shown on the lateral view to lie high
 either adjacent to the surface of the skin or outside of the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and minimal blunting of the left
 posterior costophrenic angle. No CHF. Doubt frank consolidation.
