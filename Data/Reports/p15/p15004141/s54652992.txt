                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxemia, here to evaluate for pneumonia or CHF exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___ at 14:56 p.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volume is improved from the most recent prior
 study.  There is persistent pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial edema. 
 A moderate-to-large right and small left pleural effusion are unchanged with
 underlying bibasilar opacification most likely reflecting atelectasis.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette remains enlarged but stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged pulmonary vascular congestion, bilateral pleural
 effusions and underlying atelectasis.
