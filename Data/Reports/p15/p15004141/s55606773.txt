                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and head strike.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size remains at least moderately enlarged, though assessment
 is somewhat limited due to the presence of a moderate-to-large right pleural
 effusion.  A small left pleural effusion is also noted.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities could reflect atelectasis, though infection is difficult to exclude.
 There appears to be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.  Fusion hardware within the lumbar spine is partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions, moderate to
 large on the right and small on the left.  Bibasilar airspace opacities could
 reflect atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded.
