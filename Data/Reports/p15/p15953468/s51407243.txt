                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 637
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia and respiratory failure
 status post arrest, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 638 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip 4.5 cm above the carina.  Left
 subclavian PICC line has its tip in the mid to distal SVC.  A nasogastric tube
 is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  There
 continues to be a patchy bilateral airspace process and associated layering
 moderate-to-large right pleural effusion.  These findings were shown to
 represent a combination of cavitary changes and ground-glass opacity on recent
 chest CT of ___ and are concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  Overall,
 the radiographic appearance of the chest has not changed.  No large
 pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is
 diminished given semi-erect positioning.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely unchanged given differences in technique and positioning between
 studies.
