 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest 
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___.

 catheter remains in place at the base of the right lung.  
 
 Again seen are bilateral airspace opacities consistent with pulmonary edema,

 and hilar contours are grossly unchanged.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.

 2. ET tube seen 7 cm above the carina and should be advanced 3-4 cm for
