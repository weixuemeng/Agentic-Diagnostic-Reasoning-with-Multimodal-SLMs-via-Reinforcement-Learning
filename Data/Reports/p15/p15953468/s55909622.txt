                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with PICC.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP supine
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable AP supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right PICC
 which terminates in the mid SVC.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable relative to prior examination.  Pulmonary vasculature is prominent. 
 Bilateral patchy opacities, right greater than left, may represent infectious
 process although superimposed edema is not entirely excluded.  Relative to
 prior study dated ___, this appears minimally improved
 particularly within the left hemithorax.  There is no large pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Imaged osseous structures are without an acute
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Bilateral patchy opacities, right greater than left, may reflect
 multifocal pneumonia although superimposed pulmonary edema is not entirely
 excluded.  Findings have improved relative to prior study performed ___.
 
 2.  Right PICC terminates in the mid SVC.
