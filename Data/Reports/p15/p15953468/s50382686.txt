                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is a
 pigtail catheter at the right base.  There is probably some decrease in the
 still substantial pleural effusion.  Overlying material makes it extremely
 difficult to assess for pneumothorax, though no substantial pneumothorax is
 appreciated on this limited study.
