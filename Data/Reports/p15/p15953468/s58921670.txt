                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman status post cardiac arrest with endotracheal tube
 placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable semi-upright chest radiograph shows an endotracheal tube
 in place with the tip 4 cm above the carina, unchanged from an oblique study
 from two days ago.  Right pleural effusion and patchy bilateral airspace
 consolidation persists.  A left-sided internal jugular central venous catheter
 is seen with the tip just reaching the proximal SVC.  Note is made of an ovoid
 air collection in the right mid lung zone within which soft tissue density is
 suggested, better evaluated on images from an outside chest CT from ___.
 
 CONCLUSION:  In comparison with prior study from two days ago, right-sided
 pleural effusion and bilateral patchy airspace consolidation, possible right
 lung cavitary lesion, and left infrahilar atelectasis are largely unchanged. 
 Note, slightly peripheral location of left IJ central venous catheter tip.
