                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Influenza, pneumonia, right IJ.  Evaluate for
 endotracheal tube location.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.6 cm above the level of
 the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the
 diaphragm, inferior aspect not seen on the image.  A right internal jugular
 catheter is seen terminating at the region of the brachiocephalic veins.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There are large bilateral airspace
 opacities, right greater than left.  Pleural effusion may also be present on
 the right.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, although the right aspect of
 the cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to the large right lung
 opacity.  On the right, opacity involved most of the right hemithorax aside
 from the right lung apex.  On the left, there is left mid-to-lower lung large
 area of consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.  Nasogastric tube
 courses below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included in the
 image.  Right internal jugular venous catheter terminates in the region of the
 brachiocephalic subclavian junction.
 
 Large bilateral, right greater than left, pulmonary opacities are highly
 concerning for severe multifocal pneumonia.  Right pleural effusion may be
 present.
