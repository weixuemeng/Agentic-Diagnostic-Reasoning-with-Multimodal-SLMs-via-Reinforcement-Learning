 pneumonia and pulmonary edema     Rule out pneumonia and pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette, but no appreciable elevation in pulmonary venous
 pressure. An opacification in the retrocardiac region and possibly at the
 right base is consistent with atelectasis. However, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
