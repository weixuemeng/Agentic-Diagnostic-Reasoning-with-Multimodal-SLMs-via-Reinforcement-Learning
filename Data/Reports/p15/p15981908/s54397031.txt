                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Ingestion of hair relaxant, here to evaluate for free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  Report of CT chest dated ___ and prior chest radiograph
 dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Faint opacification at the lateral aspect of the lungs bilaterally
 is thought to represent underpenetration of soft tissues.  The lungs are
 otherwise symmetrically well expanded and well aerated without focal airspace
 opacity, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are slightly prominent related in part to tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum.  The trachea is
 midline.  There is no free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No evidence of pneumomediastinum or free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
