 WET READ: ___ ___ 7:51 PM
  Low lung volumes are accentuating the bronchovascular markings, but there is
  no pulmonary edema.  A left basilar linear opacity is most consistent with
  atelectasis.  Previously seen free air is not well appreciated on this study.

 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Rales, assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal, is accentuated by low lung volumes.  Bibasilar
 atelectases are larger on the left lower lobe.  There is no pulmonary edema,
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
