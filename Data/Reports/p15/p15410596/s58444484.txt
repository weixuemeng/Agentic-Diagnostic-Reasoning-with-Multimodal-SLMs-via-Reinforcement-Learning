                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and confusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is accentuated as a result and appears
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Crowding
 of the bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema. 
 Patchy and streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Fusion hardware within the lower lumbar spine is partially imaged. 
 Compression deformity of a mid lumbar vertebral body as well as mild loss of
 height anteriorly of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction are of
 indeterminate age.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  Compression deformities within
 the imaged thoracolumbar spine, age indeterminate.
