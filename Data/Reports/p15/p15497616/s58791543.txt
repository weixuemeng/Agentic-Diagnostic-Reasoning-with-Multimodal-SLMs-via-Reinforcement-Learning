                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever in the patient two days after lumbar surgery.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable except for potential prominence of
 the left pulmonary artery that might reflect evidence of pulmonary
 hypertension.  Lungs are essentially clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No evidence of infectious process in the lungs to explain patient's fever.
