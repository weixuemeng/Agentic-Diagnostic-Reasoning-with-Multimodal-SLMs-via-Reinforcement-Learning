                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with RAF and ___ # weight gain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Low lung volumes are
 present which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette. Heart size
 appears mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures with probable mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect
 atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present. 
 Degenerative changes are noted involving both glenohumeral and
 acromioclavicular joints. No acute osseous abnormalities visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis. 
 Probable small bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
