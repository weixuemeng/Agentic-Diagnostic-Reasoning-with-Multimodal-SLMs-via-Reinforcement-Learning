                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F h/o cirrhosis who presented from rehab with fever and
 hypoxia, now with worsening hypoxia. Currently treating for HCAP.  // Eval for
 new/worsening infiltrates, pulmonary edema, any other acute pulmonary process 
 Eval for new/worsening infiltrates, pulmonary edema, any oth
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are generally low.  A very mild perihilar haze could represent
 mild edema, but the major abnormalities are areas of subsegmental atelectasis
 in both lungs, moderate on the right, mild on the left. There is no
 appreciable pleural effusion. Heart size is normal.
 
 Worsening hypoxia could be due to unexpected pulmonary emboli or progression
 of hepatic pulmonary syndrome. I see no other good explanation.
