 contours are stable. The right lung remains low in volume with streaky
 opacities at the base suggestive of atelectasis or scarring. More scattered
 opacities throughout the left lung, but slightly more prominent at the base,
 are stable either reflecting atelectasis or aspiration pneumonia. Clinical
 correlation is advised. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.
