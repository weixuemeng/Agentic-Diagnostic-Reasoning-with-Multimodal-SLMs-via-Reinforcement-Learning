                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever  // Eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.
 Given this, the there is linear left mid lung atelectasis/ scarring as well as
 likely atelectasis in the right mid lung zone. Perihilar opacities may relate
 to prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and low lung volumes although
 underlying infection is difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical
 setting. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. right glenohumeral joint
 degenerative change is incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Left mid lung
 linear atelectasis/scarring.  Bilateral perihilar opacities may relate to
 prominence of pulmonary vasculature and low lung volumes although underlying
 infection is difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.
