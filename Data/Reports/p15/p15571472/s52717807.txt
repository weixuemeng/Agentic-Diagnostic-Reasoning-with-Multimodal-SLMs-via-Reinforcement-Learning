                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, assess for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral radiographs were obtained of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None 
 
 FINDINGS: Persistent opacification of the right hemithorax with associated
 volume loss is consistent with the prior history of right pneumonectomy.  The
 left lung is clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is not reliably evaluated with normal appearance of
 the left mediastinal border.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process with unchanged postsurgical
 changes.
