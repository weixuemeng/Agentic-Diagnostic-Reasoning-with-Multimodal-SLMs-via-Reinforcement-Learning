                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, question acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate low lung
 volumes.  Bronchovascular crowding likely accounts for the relative opacity
 seen at the lung bases, mostly on the frontal view.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Bony structures
 are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited, negative.
