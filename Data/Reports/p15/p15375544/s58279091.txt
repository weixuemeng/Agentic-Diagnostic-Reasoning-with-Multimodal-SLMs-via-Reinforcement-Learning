 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is again noted with leads terminating

 Corevalve device remains in unchanged position.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Atherosclerotic calcifications at
 the aortic knob are again present.  Previously noted pattern of mild pulmonary
 edema has improved.  Lungs remain hyperinflated with linear opacities in the
 lung bases most likely reflective of atelectasis.  There may be small
 bilateral pleural effusions, but no pneumothorax is present.  There is no new
 focal consolidation.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine.

 Bibasilar atelectasis with trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Previously

 consolidation.
