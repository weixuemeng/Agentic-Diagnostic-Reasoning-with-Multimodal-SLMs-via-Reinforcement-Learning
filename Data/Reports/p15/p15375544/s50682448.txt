                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with  shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads in unchanged
 positions in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Transcatheter aortic valve
 remains in unchanged position.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are similar with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at
 the aortic knob.  There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema, not
 substantially changed in the interval.  There is likely a trace left pleural
 effusion which appears similar, and the previously noted right pleural
 effusion is likely decreased in size.  No pneumothorax is present.  Mild
 atelectasis is noted in the lung bases, more pronounced on the left.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and trace left pleural effusion, similar to
 prior exam.  Previously noted trace right pleural effusion may be improved. 
 Continued bibasilar atelectasis.
