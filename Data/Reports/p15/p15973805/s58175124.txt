                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated transfer with a right internal jugular pacer, endotracheal
 tube and OG tube.  Evaluate for pneumonia and tube placements.
 
 COMPARISON (MRN ___):  ___
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are extremely low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette
 and pulmonary vasculature.  Heart size is normal.  Moderate left pleural
 effusion and left basal consolidation are new since ___ and increasing
 since ___.  Remainder of the lung fields is essentially clear. 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard position with tip 3 cm cranial to the carina.
 Right internal jugular temporary pacer lead ends near the pulmonic valve.  An
 upper enteric tube terminates in the mid gastric body. There is no
 pneumothorax. Vascular clips denote prior gastric surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Acute, moderate left effusion and left lower lobe consolidation, point to
 pneumonia, alternatively reaction to subdiaphragmatic infection, perhaps due
 to surgical complications.
 
 2.  Right internal jugular approach pacer wire likely in the right ventricular
 outflow tract or pulmonic valve.  Appropriate positioning of ET tube and upper
 enteric tube.
 
 Dr ___ ___ reinterpretation with Dr ___ by telephone at 9:15AM.
