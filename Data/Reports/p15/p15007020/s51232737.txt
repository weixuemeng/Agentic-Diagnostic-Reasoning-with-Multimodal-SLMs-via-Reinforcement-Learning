                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough for two days.  Left lower lung field crackles.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is a subtle left lower lobe opacity
 obscured by the heart on the PA view.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The stable moderate cardiomegaly is
 exaggerated by pectus deformity.  On lateral view, the presence of left atrial
 and left ventricular enlargement suggests the presence of mitral
 regurgitation.  The aorta is stably tortuous and calcified.  The pulmonary
 vascular markings are normal.  The pacemaker with its RA and RV leads are in
 appropriate and unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Early left lower lobe pneumonia.
 2.  Marked cardiomegaly with evidence of left atrial and left ventricular
 enlargement suggesting mitral regurgitation
 3.  No pulmonary edema.
 
 Findings were conveyed to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone on
