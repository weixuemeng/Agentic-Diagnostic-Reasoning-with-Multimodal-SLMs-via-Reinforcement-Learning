                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to
 UGI and aspiration, s/p bronchoscopy  // Assess for interval change
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph, frontal view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 46 mm above the carina.  Transesophageal tube courses below
 the diaphragm and out of view.  Right internal jugular venous catheter
 terminates in mid SVC.  Increased attenuation of the right lung is likely due
 to layering large pleural effusion which is increased from before.  Bilateral
 lower lobe collapse is unchanged.  Left pleural effusion is small and
 unchanged.  Opacity in the right lung apex appears slightly denser.  Enlarged
 cardiac silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion is slightly larger air than before.  Small left
 pleural effusion is stable.  Bilateral lower lobe collapse is unchanged.
