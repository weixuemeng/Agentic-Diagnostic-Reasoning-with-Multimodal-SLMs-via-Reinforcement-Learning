                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Upper GIB intubated  // ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent prior from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ETT and right subclavian line are present in standard positions.  There has
 been interval removal of the enteric tube.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  Lung volumes are lower than on the most recent prior
 study.  Atelectasis with small pleural effusion is noted at the right lung
 base.  Hazy opacification of the right lung is noted with relative increased
 lucency of the left lung, increased compared to prior.  This may be technical.
 However, mild pulmonary edema is resolved.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left
 base atelectasis is present.  Gaseous distention of the stomach is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ET tube in standard position.
 2.  Lower lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and small right pleural
 effusion.
