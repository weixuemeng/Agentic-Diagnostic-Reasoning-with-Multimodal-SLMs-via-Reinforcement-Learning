                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 12:12 P.M.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new fevers, question pulmonary etiology.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___.
 
 An AP upright and lateral view of the chest ___ at 12:12 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged being upper limits of
 normal given portable technique.  There continues to be a layering left
 effusion with patchy associated airspace opacity likely reflecting compressive
 atelectasis.  There is possibly also a tiny right effusion given blunting of
 the costophrenic angle.  Otherwise, the lungs are hyperinflated suggestive of
 underlying emphysema.  Right internal jugular central line has been removed. 
 No pneumothorax.  A portion of a left renal stent is visualized on the edge of
 the image.
