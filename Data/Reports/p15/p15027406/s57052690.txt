                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypertensive urgency, fluid overload.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 7:29 a.m.
 
 Compared with prior film, there has been considerable interval improvement in
 the bibasilar opacity and left effusion.  There is minimal residual patchy
 opacity at the right base, with slight blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle.  At the left base, there is minimal, if any, residual pleural fluid and
 minimal subsegmental atelectasis.  Again seen is evidence of COPD, with
 hyperinflation, flattened diaphragms, and parenchymal distortion.  Also again
 seen is moderately severe cardiomegaly with a calcified unfolded aorta.  No
 CHF.  The lateral view raises the question of upper-limits-of-normal
 dilatation of the upper abdominal aorta (2.9 cm.
 
 The patient's left-sided pacemaker with lead tips over right atrium and right
 ventricle again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval improvement in bibasilar opacities.  No new opacity identified. 
 No CHF.
 2. COPD and moderately severe cardiomegaly.  
 3. Borderline aneurysmal dilatation of the upper abdominal aorta.
