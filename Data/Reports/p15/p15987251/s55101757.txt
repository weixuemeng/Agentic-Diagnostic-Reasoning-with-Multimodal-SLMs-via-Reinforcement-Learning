 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a combination of septic and cardiogenic shock
 following line placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 4:22 p.m.:
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved, though the decrease is exaggerated
 by the increase in lung volumes concomitantly.  Mediastinal vascular
 engorgement has resolved.  Heart size top normal.  Pleural effusion small if
 any.  Left jugular line ends in the low SVC and right subclavian line close to
 the superior cavoatrial junction.  Pleural effusions are presumed, but not
 substantial.
