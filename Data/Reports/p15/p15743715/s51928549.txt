                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post fall with head and neck pain,
 with head laceration.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax, although the posterior costophrenic sulci
 are excluded limiting evaluation for tiny effusions. Heart size is within
 normal limits.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal allowing
 for low lung volumes.  No acute osseous injury is identified.  There is no
 free air under the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study. No acute intrathoracic process.
