                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough and rales in right axilla,
 evaluate for possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of
 ___.  There is evidence of moderate cardiac enlargement and the
 thoracic aorta is moderately elongated and shows calcium deposits in the wall.
 No local contour abnormalities are identified.  The pulmonary vasculature
 demonstrates an upper zone re-distribution pattern and there are increased
 interstitial structures on both bases.  The lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.  Acute discrete parenchymal
 infiltrates of pneumonia appearance are not seen.  On the preceding chest
 examination of ___, patient had similar findings.  It was at that
 time interpreted as probably being in pulmonary vascular congestion whereas
 pneumonic infiltrates were not seen.
 
 Findings on the present chest examination are very similar to what existed
 before and suggest the presence of probably idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in
 the lung bases.  No new parenchymal infiltrates are seen.  As on the previous
 examination, there is evidence of a left-sided shoulder arthrodesis,
 unchanged.  Our records include a previous chest CT of ___.  The
 report at that time excluded pulmonary emboli, observed bilateral ground-glass
 opacities most severe on the lung bases, evidence of moderate collapse of the
 left mainstem bronchus compatible with bronchomalacia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of new parenchymal infiltrates indicative of
 pneumonia.
