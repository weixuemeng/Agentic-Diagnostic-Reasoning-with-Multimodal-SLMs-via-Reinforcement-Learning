                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Chronic interstitial opacities are again noted
 bilaterally, most pronounced within the periphery and lung bases, previously
 thought to reflect NSIP. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is
 likely due to the presence of low lung volumes without overt pulmonary edema. 
 Slightly increased opacification at the lung bases may reflect superimposed
 atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Left
 humeral prosthesis is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with chronic interstitial opacities compatible with
 previously characterized NSIP.  Slightly increased patchy opacities in the
 lung bases may reflect superimposed atelectasis, however infection is
 difficult to exclude.
