 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Gastrointestinal bleed, status post nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 nasogastric tube.  The course of the tube appears unremarkable.  The tip of
 the tube, however, can only be followed down to the lower third of the
 esophagus and is not seen beyond this anatomic location.  Abdominal views are
 recommended to determine the exact location of the tube tip.  Low lung
 volumes.  No pneumothorax.  Mild crowding of vascular structures at the lung
 bases.  Mild cardiomegaly.
