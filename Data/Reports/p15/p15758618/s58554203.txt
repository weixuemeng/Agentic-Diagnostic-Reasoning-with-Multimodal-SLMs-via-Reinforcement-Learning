                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and altered mental status.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Given low lung volumes, as well as soft tissue attenuation in the
 right lower hemithorax, there does not appear to be any focal consolidations
 concerning for pneumonia, but likely a small right pleural effusion.  The
 cardiac size is within normal limits.  The patient is rotated exaggerating the
 mediastinal contours.  There may be slight cephalization of the vessels which
 could be related to mild vascular congestion; however, there is no frank
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Perhaps mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Small right pleural
 effusion.
