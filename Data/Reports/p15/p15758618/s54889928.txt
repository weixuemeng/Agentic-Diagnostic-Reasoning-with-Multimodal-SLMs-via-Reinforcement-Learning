 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to a prior study, the nasogastric tube has been
 removed.  A new right PICC line.  The course of the line is unremarkable, the
 tip of the line projects over the upper-to-mid SVC.  There is no evidence of
 complications, notably no pneumothorax.
 
 Mild fluid overload and moderate cardiomegaly persist.  Retrocardiac
 atelectasis.  No larger pleural effusions.
