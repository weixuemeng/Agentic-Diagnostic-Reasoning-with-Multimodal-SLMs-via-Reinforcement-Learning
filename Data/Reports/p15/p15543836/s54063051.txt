  Enteric feeding tube coursing midline with tip in stomach and side-port at the
  level of the diaphragm.  Consider advancing 5-10 cm for better positioning.
  
  Endotracheal tube incompletely evaluated.  Recommend repeat chest radiograph
  to assess endotracheal tube positioning.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ETT  // placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 4.6 cm above the level of the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach, as expected.  Mild bilateral
 hilar fullness likely represents mild central pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Left retrocardiac airspace opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear without lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal central pulmonary vascular congestion and left retrocardiac
 atelectasis.  ETT and NG tube are in appropriate position.
