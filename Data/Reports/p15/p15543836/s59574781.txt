                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ETT  // placement?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 4.3 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube
 is coiled within the stomach.  Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  Bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  There is no
 lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly larger compared to the prior
 study and there is pulmonary vascular redistribution.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Appropriate positioning of an ETT and nasogastric tube.  Low lung volumes with
 bibasilar atelectasis.
