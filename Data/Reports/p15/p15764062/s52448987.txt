                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The
 hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The central
 pulmonary vessels are prominent; however, no overt edema is seen.  The lung
 volumes are low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Bibasilar linear
 opacities are most compatible with atelectasis, although increased right
 basilar opacity may reflect a small consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Right basilar opacity
 is likely atelectasis; however, please correlate with physical findings in
 this area to exclude consolidation.
