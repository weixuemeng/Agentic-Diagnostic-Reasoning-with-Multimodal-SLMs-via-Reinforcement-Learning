 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute onset of dyspnea, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  No evidence of acute lung disease.  Unchanged position of the right
 PICC line, with its tip projecting over the right atrium.  The technical
 quality of the examination is limited given respiratory motion artifacts, in
 particular at the level of the lung bases.
