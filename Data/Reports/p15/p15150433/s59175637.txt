 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___
 through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Supine positioning probably exaggerated severe cardiomegaly, but there is the
 suggestion of new mild pulmonary edema.  This is most pronounced in the region
 of previous pneumonia in the right lung.  Pleural effusion is presumed, but
 not substantial.  There is no pneumothorax.  ET tube and nasogastric drainage
 tube are in standard placements and a left PIC line ends in the upper SVC.
