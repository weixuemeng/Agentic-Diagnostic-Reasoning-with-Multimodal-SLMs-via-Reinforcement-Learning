                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman intubated with multifocal pneumonia and
 pulmonary edema  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:31
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube remains present, tip approximately 4.7 cm above the carina.  An NG
 type tube is also present, tip beneath diaphragm, off film.  Left subclavian
 PICC line is again noted overlying the proximal SVC.
 
 Rotated positioning.  No definite change in the overall cardiac
 cardiomediastinal silhouette or prominent pulmonary arteries.
 
 Vascular plethora and and increased interstitial markings are compatible with
 CHF which may be slightly improved.  Increased retrocardiac density,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, is also
 slightly improved.
 
 Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  Small left effusion cannot
 be excluded.
 
 Ovoid focal opacity overlying left upper zone laterally is new compared with
 the prior study and lies an area of overlying tubing --___ artifact
 outside of the the patient?
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
 2. Continued CHF with interstitial edema, though there is evidence of slight
 improvement.
 3. Interval improvement in left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
