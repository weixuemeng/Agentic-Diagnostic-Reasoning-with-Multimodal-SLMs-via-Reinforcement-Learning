                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms compatible with
 COPD.  Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous and the remainder of
 the mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Minimal atelectatic changes are noted in the lung
 bases.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 Moderate to severe multilevel degenerative changes are re- demonstrated in the
 mid to lower thoracic spine with mild loss of height of a low thoracic
 vertebral body which is chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
