 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypotension and hypoglycemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Moderate bibasilar opacities persist, likely
 reflecting a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusions.  The left-sided
 effusion is moderate and the right effusion is small; both are unchanged
 compared to prior examination from ___.  Mild pulmonary edema is
 improved in the interval.  There is no pneumothorax.  A coarse linear opacity
 in the right upper lung is unchanged dating back to ___, and likely
 reflects vascular calcifications.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Grossly stable bibasilar opacities, likely a combination of atelectasis and
 bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. Improving mild pulmonary
 edema.
