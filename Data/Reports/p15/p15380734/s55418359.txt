                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with question sepsis, please eval to rule out
 acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Portable AP chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is a
 moderate left pleural effusion, increased since the prior exam.  There is a
 stable small right pleural effusion.  The pulmonary vasculature is prominent
 consistent with pulmonary edema.  Opacity in the left lung most likely
 represents atelectasis. The heart size is top normal and there are aortic knob
 calcifications.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased left pleural effusion and pulmonary edema.  Left lung
 opacity most likely represents atelectasis, although an early developing
 infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.  Recommend repeat radiographs after
 diuresis to rule out underlying infectious process.
