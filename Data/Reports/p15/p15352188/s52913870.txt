                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY  History: ___F with cough and low sat  // ? pneumonia      ?
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Anatomy is distorted by a a severe dextro otoscoliosis, as demonstrated
 previously.  In addition, the lung bases are partially obscured by soft
 tissue.  There is streaky density at the lung bases likely representing
 subsegmental atelectasis.  This is somewhat more pronounced in the right lung
 base and a small peribronchial infiltrate would be difficult to exclude.  The
 heart and mediastinal structures are stable.  The aorta is tortuous and
 calcified.  The bony thorax is grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe scoliosis there is streaky density at the lung bases likely
 representing subsegmental atelectasis.  A small focal pulmonary infiltrate,
 particularly at the right lung base, would be difficult to exclude, however.
