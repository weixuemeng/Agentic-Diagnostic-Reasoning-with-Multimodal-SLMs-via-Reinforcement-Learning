                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate extensive consolidation in
 the lingula and left lower lobe.  The cardiac silhouette is difficult to
 evaluate secondary to this overlying opacity, but is likely normal in size. 
 There is also a moderate left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is
 visualized.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lung consolidation compatible with lingular and left lower lobe
 pneumonia.  Moderate left pleural effusion, likely parapneumonic.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Followup chest radiograph in 4 weeks is recommended to
 evaluate for resolution following appropriate antibiotic therapy.
