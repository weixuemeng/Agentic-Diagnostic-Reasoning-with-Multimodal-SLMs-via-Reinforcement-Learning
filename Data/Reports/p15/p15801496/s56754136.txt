                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hx pna presenting with worsening symptoms.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   There is improvement in left
 basal opacity though mild residual consolidation persists which likely
 reflects mild residual pneumonia.  A small left pleural effusion appears
 improved from prior.  Right lung remains clear.  Heart size cannot be readily
 assessed due to effacement of the left heart border.  Mediastinal contour is
 normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small residual left effusion and mild residual lingular opacity likely
 reflects resolving pneumonia.
