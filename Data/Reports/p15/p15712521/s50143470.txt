                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough for one week.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Mild cardiac enlargement is unchanged when
 compared to the prior study.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. 
 Minimal streaky opacity in the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis,
 and there is mild crowding of the bronchovascular structures due to slightly
 low lung volumes.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is present.  Scoliosis of the thoracic spine, convex to
 the right is redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mildly reduced lung volumes with probable atelectasis in the
 right lung base.
