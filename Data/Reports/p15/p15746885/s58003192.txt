                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sclerosis after TIPS with sputum, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is indistinctness of
 pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Small
 right pleural effusion persists.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia, especially at the right base, would have to be
 considered.
