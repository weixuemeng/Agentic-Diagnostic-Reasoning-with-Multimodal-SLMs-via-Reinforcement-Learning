                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, PA and lateral
 view shows some opacification posteriorly which could represent pleural
 thickening or atelectatic changes at the right base.  No unequivocal evidence
 of acute pneumonia, though this would still have to be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
