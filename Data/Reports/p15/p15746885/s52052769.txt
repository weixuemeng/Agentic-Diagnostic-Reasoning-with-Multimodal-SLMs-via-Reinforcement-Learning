                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with cirrhosis, now with chest congestion and
 cough.  Evaluate possible pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Multiples small irregular opacities are present in the lower lungs.  The
 findings were similar on ___ when lung volumes were lower, and there
 is evidence of congestion in both central and pulmonary circulations.  Most
 likely explanation is somewhat atypical appearance of edema, but if following
 diuresis chest radiographs do not show substantial clearing of the nodular
 component, I would recommend chest CT scanning to exclude real lung nodules,
 presumably infectious.  Heart size is normal and there is no appreciable
 pleural effusion.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 11 a.m. when the findings were recognized.
