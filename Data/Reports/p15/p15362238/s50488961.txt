                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Left-sided pacemaker
 device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle,
 and region of the coronary sinus.  Heart size remains mild to moderately
 enlarged. The aorta remains tortuous.  Hilar contours are unchanged. Moderate
 size right pleural effusion is re- demonstrated with a laterally loculated
 component, not substantially changed in the interval.  No overt pulmonary
 edema is demonstrated. Right basilar opacity could reflect compressive
 atelectasis though infection cannot be completely excluded.  Left lung is
 grossly clear. No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Relatively unchanged appearance of moderate size right pleural effusion, a
 component of which appears to be loculated laterally. Right basilar opacity
 could reflect compressive atelectasis though infection is difficult to
 exclude.
