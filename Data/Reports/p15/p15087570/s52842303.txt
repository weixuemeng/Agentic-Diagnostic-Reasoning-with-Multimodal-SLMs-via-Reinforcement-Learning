  New interstitial abnormality, which most likely represents mild pulmonary
  edema, but differential diagnosis includes atypical infection. New small
  bilateral pleural effusions. Follow up chest radiograph after diuresis, if
  performed, may be helpful. Discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 21:09 on
  ___ at time of discovery. Retrocardiac density most likely represents
  atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. Discussed with
  Dr. ___ by phone at 21:12 on ___ at time of discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cholangitis, persistent dyspnea and hypoxia.  Question pulmonary
 edema.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 enlarged, slightly more than on the prior film.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. 
 Probable atelectasis at both bases, though the possibility of an underlying
 pneumonic infiltrate would be difficult to exclude.  Small bilateral effusions
 are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings consistent with CHF, with bibasilar atelectasis.  A superimposed
 pneumonic infiltrate would be difficult to exclude.  Small bilateral
 effusions.  These findings are new compared with ___.
 
 2.  Cardiomediastinal enlargement, slightly more pronounced than on ___.
