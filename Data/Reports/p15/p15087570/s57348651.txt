                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, retching, rigors x ___ weeks  // ?pna,
 colitis, diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low and exaggerate heart size, which is likely mildly
 enlarged.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Trace bilateral
 pleural effusions.  There is mild central vascular congestion without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes exaggerate heart size, which is mildly enlarged.  Given
 the absence of interstitial edema, this could represent cardiomyopathy or
 pericardial effusion.  Recommend correlation with physical exam findings.
 2. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
