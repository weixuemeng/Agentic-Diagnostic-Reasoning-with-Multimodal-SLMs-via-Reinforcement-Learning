                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CKD cholangitis, volume overload from resuscitation.  Question
 interval change after diuresis.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 18:21 p.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film, there has been considerable improvement in the
 CHF findings.  There is residual upper zone redistribution, but generalized
 pulmonary vascular plethora and the interstitial edema has resolved.  There
 are small bilateral effusions seen posteriorly. There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains slightly enlarged, but
 appears slightly less prominent than on the prior exam.  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change.  Suspect background COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval improvement in CHF findings.
 2.  Upper zone redistribution, bibasilar atelectasis, and small posterior
 effusions.
