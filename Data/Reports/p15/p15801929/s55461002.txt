 silhouette is top normal in size, but stable.  The mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, as before. 
 Multilevel mild degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Patchy bibasilar opacities
 concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
