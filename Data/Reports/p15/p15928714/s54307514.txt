                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of right posterior
 tenderness to palpation over sixth to eighth ribs.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Large
 retrocardiac hiatal hernia with air-fluid level is again seen.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There
 is a fracture of the posterolateral right seventh rib and possible
 nondisplaced fracture of the posterior right sixth rib versus artifact.  The
 lateral right sixth, eighth, ninth and lower ribs are not well evaluated on
 this study and if clinical concern, suggest dedicated rib series.  The aorta
 is calcified and tortuous.  Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimally displaced fracture of the posterolateral right seventh
 rib and possible nondisplaced fracture of the posterolateral right sixth rib. 
 The ribs are not optimally evaluated on this chest radiograph.  Consider
 dedicated rib series for further evaluation.
