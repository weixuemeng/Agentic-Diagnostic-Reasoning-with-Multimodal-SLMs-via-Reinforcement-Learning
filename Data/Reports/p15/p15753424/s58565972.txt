                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ngt // assess NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___ at 01:22
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 5.5 hours prior, there is
 increased right lower lobe atelectasis.  Unchanged, dense, left lower lobe
 consolidation with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm is likely
 atelectasis with a moderate pleural effusion or alternatively a developing
 pneumonia.  Moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged. An NG tube has been
 advanced and is coiled within the gastric fundus.  An ET tube now terminates
 4.5 cm above the carina. A right-sided IJ central venous catheter is unchanged
 in position and terminates in the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 An NG tube is coiled in the gastric fundus.
 Unchanged, moderate pulmonary edema.  Increased right lower lobe atelectasis
 with a small right pleural effusion.  Unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis or
 pneumonia with a small to moderate pleural effusion.
