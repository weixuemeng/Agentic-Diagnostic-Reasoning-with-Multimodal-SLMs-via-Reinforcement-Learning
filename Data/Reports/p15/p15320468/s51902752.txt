 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:27 PM
  Esophageal catheter courses below the diaphragm and curves superiorly
  projecting over the left upper quadrant, likely within the stomach. Persistent
  abnormal appearance to the left lower hemithorax with slight improved
  aeration. Given the course of the esophageal catheter, diaphragmatic hernia is
  a possibility, chronicity indeterminate. Left pleural effusion is also a
  possibility. This could be further evaluated with CT, as recommended
  previously.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, the tip lies approximately 3.6 cm above the carina.  
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with
 interstitial edema.  There is opacification at the left base, with obscuration
 of the left hemidiaphragm, in an unusual configuration.  The appearance raises
 question of a large gastric and/or diaphragmatic hernia.  
 
 An NG tube is present, the tip extends to the level of the lower mediastinum
 and overlies the left upper quadrant near the expected site of the physiologic
 diaphragm.  A left effusion cannot be excluded.  There is minimal atelectasis
 at the right base and minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube in satisfactory position.
 2.  Interstitial edema.
 3.  Atypical opacity in the left mid and lower zones raising the question of
 gastric and/or diaphragmatic hernia.  NG tube as described.  This appearance
 is similar to ___ at 12:24 p.m.  If clinically indicated, abdominal CT
 could help for further assessment.
