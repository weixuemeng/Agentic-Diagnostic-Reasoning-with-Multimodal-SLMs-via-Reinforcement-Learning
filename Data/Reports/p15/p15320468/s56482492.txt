                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a semi-erect position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube tip projects approximately 4 cm above the carina.
 An esophageal catheter courses below the diaphragm, likely within the stomach.
 There is marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with bowel/stomach
 underneath, query diaphragmatic hernia/injury, with subsequent shift of the
 mediastinum to the left.  The visualized portions of lung demonstrate no
 evidence for focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.   The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube tip projecting 4 cm above the carina.
 2.  Marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with likely stomach and/or
 bowel beneath.  Query diaphragmatic hernia, diaphragmatic injury/rupture can
 not be excluded.  Recommend clinical correlation, correlation with any prior
 chest imaging, and consider CT for further evaluation.
