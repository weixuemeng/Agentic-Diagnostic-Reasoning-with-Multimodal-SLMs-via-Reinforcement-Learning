                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:03 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with respiratory failure and subdural hematoma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Much of the opacification projected over the left lower hemithorax is due to
 fluid-filled stomach that is either herniated or beneath the chronically
 elevated left hemidiaphragm, but it obscures what is probably a substantially
 atelectatic left lower lobe and perhaps some pleural effusion.  Atelectasis in
 the right lower lung and small right pleural effusion have developed since
 ___, worsened since ___.  The heart is moderately enlarged. 
 Thoracic aorta is generally enlarged and calcified.  An enteric tube ends in
 the lower esophagus or proximal stomach above the level of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
