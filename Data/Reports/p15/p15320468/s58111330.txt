                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Patient is status post evacuation of subdural, altered mental
 status and seizure activity.  For evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  ET tube is identified in good position about 3-4 cm above the carina.
 An NG tube is coiled within a massive retrocardiac hiatal hernia.  This is
 associated with significant atelectasis.  There is opacification of both lung
 bases suggesting small pleural effusions.  There is worsening opacification of
 the left upper lung zone while the appearances mostly of vascular congestion,
 superimposed pneumonia is not excluded.
 
 A right-sided PICC line is in unchanged position.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Probable slightly worsening bibasilar pleural effusions.  Worsening opacity in
 the left upper lung zone.  Support hardware remains unchanged in position.
