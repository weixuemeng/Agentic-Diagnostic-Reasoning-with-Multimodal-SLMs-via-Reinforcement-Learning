                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, the tip lies approximately 4.8 cm above the carina.  An
 NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film.  A right-sided
 PICC line is present, tip at the SVC/RA junction.  No supine film evidence of
 pneumothorax is identified. 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes. ___ allowing for this, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette  appears enlarged.  There is left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation with increased retrocardiac density and
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  There is subsegmental atelectasis at
 the right base.   Allowing for low inspiratory volumes and supine technique,
 no overt CHF.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 2:00 a.m. and allowing for technical differences, the
 left base consolidation is worse, but this appearance is likely accentuated
 due to differences between semi-erect and portable techniques.
