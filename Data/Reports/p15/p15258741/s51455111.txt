                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure, evaluate interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  An ET tube is present, the tip lies
 approximately 5.8 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip extending
 beneath diaphragm off film.  A right subclavian PICC line is present, tip
 overlying right atrium, though its position is likely accentuated by low
 inspiratory volumes and lordotic positioning.  
 
 Again seen is prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, grossly
 unchanged.  Also again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. 
 Possibility of a left-sided pleural effusion cannot be excluded.    There is
 vascular plethora and vascular blurring, likely accentuated by low lung
 volumes.  There is atelectasis at the right base.Doubt gross right effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Change in position of PICC line, which may be accentuated by lordotic
 positioning.  The tip now overlies the upper right atrium.
 
 2.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, unchanged.
 
 3.  Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and vascular markings, also
 grossly unchanged.
