                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Right rib pain after a fall. Question rib fracture or
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs are available from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The heart is
 borderline in size. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The lungs appear clear. No
 fracture is identified. There is vague sclerosis in a linear fashion along the
 lower part of the scapula which may be due to a prior fracture. Correlation
 with physical findings is suggested.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. Vague linear sclerosis in the
 lower scapula; although recent fracture is doubtful, if physical findings
 refer to the site, the dedicated scapula radiographs could be considered.
