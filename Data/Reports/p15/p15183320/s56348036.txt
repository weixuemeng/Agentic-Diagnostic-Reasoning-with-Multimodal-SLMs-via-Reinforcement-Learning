                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with liposarcoma  // re-staging: eval for
 pulmonary metastatic disease
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Lungs are clear. Pulmonary nodule seen
 along the fissure on the left is too small to be noted on the current chest
 radiograph and reassessment with chest CT would be justified.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No new nodules are noted within the
 limitations of the resolution of the study technique.
