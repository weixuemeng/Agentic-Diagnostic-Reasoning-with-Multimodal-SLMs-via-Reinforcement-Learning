                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath, question congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Heart is moderately enlarged, pulmonary vasculature engorged, and interstitial
 abnormality at the lung base is probably mild edema.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are dependent, and probably minimize the visual impact of mild
 hyperinflation.  A cluster of smaller irregular opacities in the axillary
 region of the right lung are of uncertain chronicity and significance, and
 should be evaluated at least with repeat chest radiographs over the next
 several weeks.  CT scanning may ultimately be necessary unless prior imaging
 can be obtained.
 
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are continuous from
 the left axillary generator.  No pneumothorax.
