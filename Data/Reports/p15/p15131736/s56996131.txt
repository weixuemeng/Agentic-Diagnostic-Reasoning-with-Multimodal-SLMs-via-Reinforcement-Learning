                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia and CHF exacerbation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  Substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 persists with extremely prominent pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary
 artery hypertension.  Some retrocardiac opacification is consistent with
 atelectasis or supervening pneumonia.  There are small bilateral effusions
 with some atelectatic change at the right base.
