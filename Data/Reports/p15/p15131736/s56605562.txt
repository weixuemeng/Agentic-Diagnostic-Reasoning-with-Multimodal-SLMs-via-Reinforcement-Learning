                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, for tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal
 tube lies approximately 5 cm above the carina.  Bibasilar opacities persist,
 more prominent on the left, and most likely representing atelectasis and small
 effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would
 have to be considered.
 
 Nasogastric tube extends to the distal stomach and central catheter tip is in
 the lower portion of the SVC.  Stable cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little overall change.
