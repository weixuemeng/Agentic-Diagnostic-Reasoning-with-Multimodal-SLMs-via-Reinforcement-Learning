                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left chest tube, left pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 13 32.  Chest CT ___ at 14:09.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is seen within the chest wall and neck.  A
 left chest tube tip projects over the medial mid lung field.  A small left
 pneumothorax is demonstrated, though the assessment of this is limited by the
 overlying extensive subcutaneous emphysema.  Heart size is normal.  No
 rightward shift of the mediastinum is demonstrated.  Focal opacity within the
 left lung base could reflect infection or aspiration.  Multiple left-sided rib
 fractures are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Extensive subcutaneous emphysema with pneumomediastinum and small left
 pneumothorax.  Left basilar opacity is concerning for infection or aspiration.
