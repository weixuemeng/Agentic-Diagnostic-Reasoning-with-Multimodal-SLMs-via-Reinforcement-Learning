                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, cough, recent pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest upright AP and lateral views
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Heart size remains
 mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contours are unchanged with tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta again noted. The right PICC has been removed. Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal. Lung volumes are low. Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present, but assessment of the lung apices is limited as the patient's soft
 tissues of the neck project over and obscure these regions. No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
