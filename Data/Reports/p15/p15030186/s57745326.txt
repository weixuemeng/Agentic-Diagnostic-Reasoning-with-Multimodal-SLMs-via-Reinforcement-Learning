                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F w/hypoxia and chest pain, please eval for pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, reflective of a tortuous thoracic
 aorta and probable mild cardiomegaly.  Lung volumes are low. There is probably
 minimal left basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise, there is no new focal lung
 consolidation.  There is no pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  It
 would be difficult to exclude a small left pleural effusion given appearance. 
 No sizable right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Relatively stable chest radiograph demonstrating mildly increased left basilar
 opacity the setting of lower lung volumes, probably representing atelectasis.
