                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:22.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A new endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.2 cm from the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube is noted which terminates below the left hemidiaphragm, off
 the inferior borders of the film,.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size appears
 moderately enlarged.  Widening of the superior mediastinum is likely due to
 supine technique and low lung volumes.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  No overt pulmonary edema is noted.  Retrocardiac
 hazy opacity may reflect atelectasis.  A small left pleural effusion may be
 present.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.  Low lung
 volumes.  Hazy retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis.  Possible small
 left pleural effusion.
