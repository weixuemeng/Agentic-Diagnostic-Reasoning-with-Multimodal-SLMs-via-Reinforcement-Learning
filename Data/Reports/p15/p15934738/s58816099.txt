                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left PICC remains in place, coursing within a left-sided superior
 vena cava, unchanged in position.  Persistent moderate cardiomegaly is
 accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema. 
 Small right pleural effusion is present with adjacent patchy posterior basilar
 opacity.  In addition to the dependent pleural effusion, there is a suggestion
 of a focal loculation laterally in the mid portion of the right chest,
 although prominent extrapleural fat probably contributes to this appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Cardiomegaly and congestive heart failure.
 
 2.  Small right pleural effusion with possible component of loculation
 laterally.  Adjacent dependent right lower lobe opacity may reflect
 atelectasis, but pneumonia should also be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
