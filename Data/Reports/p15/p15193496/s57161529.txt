                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Assault to head, intoxicated.  Evaluate for rib
 fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are very low,
 which causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  No focal opacity,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  The mediastinal and cardiac
 contours are likely normal.  No rib fractures are identified.  If there are
 focal symptoms, dedicated views of those areas are recommended.
