 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cough and dyspnea, evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a mildly tortuous thoracic aorta, with aortic arch calcifications
 noted, unchanged from prior; the remainder of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are stable and within normal limits.  The bilateral hila are
 unremarkable.  A rounded opacity at the left lung base measures approximately
 7 mm, not clearly seen on the lateral projection, and not apparent on prior
 radiographs. The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no evidence of pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. 7 mm left lower lung rounded opacity, not seen on prior exams or on lateral
 projection, possibly a nodule.  Recommend repeat PA and lateral chest
 radiograph for further evaluation.
 2. Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat PA and lateral chest x-ray to further evaluate left
 lower lobe rounded opacity.
