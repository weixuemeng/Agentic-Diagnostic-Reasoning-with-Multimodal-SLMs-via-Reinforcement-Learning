  1. No pneumothorax identified.
  2. Significant interval improvement of asymmetric vascular engorgement and
  indistinct pulmonary vasculature, right greater than left.
  3. Hyperinflated lungs.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 9:24 AM
  Significant interval improvement in vascular crowding and indistinct pulmonary
  vasculature, right greater than left, compared to ___.
  
  Unchanged air lucency between the left cardiac silhouette and medial left
  lung, which may reflect a persistent small medial left pneumothorax.
 WET READ VERSION #2 ___ ___ 9:57 AM
  
  1. Significant interval improvement in vascular crowding and indistinct
  pulmonary vasculature, right greater than left, compared to ___.
  2. Unchanged area of lucency between the left cardiac silhouette and medial
  left lung, which may reflect a persistent small medial left pneumothorax.
  3. Heterogeneous area of opacification at the right lung base likely
  represents vascular crowding or atelectasis, less likely aspiration or
  pneumonia.
