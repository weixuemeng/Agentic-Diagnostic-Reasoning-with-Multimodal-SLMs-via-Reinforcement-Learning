                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Acute pulmonary embolism and pneumonia, chest pain.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right internal jugular line has been discontinued.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax demonstrated on the current examination.  The previously seen
 right middle lobe consolidation appears to be improved since the prior study. 
 It might reflect interval improvement of pulmonary infarct.  Alternatively, it
 could be less prominent due to different rotation of the patient.
