                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough.  Evaluate for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, including ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  There is calcification of the aorta, indicating
 atherosclerosis.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  There may be slight
 blunting of the costophrenic angles.  No pneumothorax is seen. There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.  Again seen is a partially visualized sclerotic,
 nonaggressive appearing lesion in the right proximal humerus, likely
 representing an enchondroma with bone infarct considered less likely. 
 Degenerative changes of the visualized thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles, which may represent trace
 pleural effusions, mild atelectasis or pleural thickening.  Otherwise, no
 acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
