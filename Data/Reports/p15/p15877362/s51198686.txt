                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and hypotension and patient with prior history of
 pulmonary embolism.  CTA chest from ___ and chest radiograph
 from ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  There is a focal opacity in the
 left lower lung, partially obscuring the left cardiac silhouette.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear.  There is a large amount of relative lucency within the
 left lung, which is suggestive of emphysema.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Subtle opacity of the left lower lung abutting the left heart
 border which may represent an early lingular pneumonia . Please refer to
 subsequent CTA chest for additional details.
