                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with pre-psych facility placement screening. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 Chest radiograph dated ___.
 Reference is made to CTA chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low with bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, edema, or pneumothorax.  Slight increase lucency in the left
 upper and mid hemithorax is likely secondary to emphysema which is more severe
 in the left lung as seen on the CT chest from ___.  The thoracic aorta is
 tortuous or ectatic.  Aortic knob calcifications are mild.  The heart is
 probably normal in size given the lower lung volumes.  Sclerotic,
 nonaggressive appearing lesion is incompletely imaged in the right proximal
 humerus but was also seen partially in ___, most likely an enchondroma, less
 likely bone infarct.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal pneumonia.
