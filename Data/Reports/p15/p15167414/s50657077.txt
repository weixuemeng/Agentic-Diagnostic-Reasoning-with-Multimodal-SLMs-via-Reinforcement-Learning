                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with congestive heart
 failure and end-stage renal disease with volume overload.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and right ventricle. 
 Post-sternotomy wires are re-demonstrated.  There is no substantial change in
 bilateral interstitial opacities concerning for interstitial pulmonary
 edema/volume overload.  Enlargement of the right thyroid gland is suspected
 given the leftward deviation of the trachea.  Small amount of left pleural
 effusion is noted, new.  Heart size and mediastinum although stable
 demonstrate evidence of cardiac enlargement.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 lateral view demonstrates substantially high position of the bowel anteriorly,
 grossly unchanged since the prior study, might represent anatomical variant.
