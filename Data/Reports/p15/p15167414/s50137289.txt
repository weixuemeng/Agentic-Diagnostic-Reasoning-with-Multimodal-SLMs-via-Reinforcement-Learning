                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with jaw pain and elevated troponins.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart size is
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  The right lower lobe
 heterogeneous opacity could represent atelectasis, but pneumonia is not
 excluded.  Interstitial lung markings are diffusely increased, suggesting
 pulmonary edema although other diffuse interstitial lung diseases cannot be
 excluded.  Leftward deviation of the trachea is consistent with thyroid
 goiter.  The patient is status post CABG.  Pacer leads of a left chest wall
 generator terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right lower lobe atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.  
 2.  Diffusely increased interstitial markings could represent pulmonary edema.
 Repeat radiographs are recommended after therapy to document resolution.
 3.  Leftward deviation of the trachea is consistent with thyroid goiter.
 4.  Mild cardiomegaly.
 
 Final impression was communicated via phone call by ___ to ___, CCU
 resident, on ___ at ___.
