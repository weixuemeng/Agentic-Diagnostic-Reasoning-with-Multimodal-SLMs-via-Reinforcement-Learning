 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, new cough, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The known right mass with associated chest wall destruction and
 pleural effusion is unchanged.  Otherwise, the lung parenchyma appears
 constant.  There is no evidence of new parenchymal opacities suggestive of
 pneumonia.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged presence of a
 left pectoral Port-A-Cath.  No pneumothorax.
