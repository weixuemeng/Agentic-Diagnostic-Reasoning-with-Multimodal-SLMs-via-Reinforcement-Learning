                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nephrolithiasis, ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of an
 endotracheal tube with its tip at the clavicular level, approximately 6 cm
 above the carina.  The huge right mid and lower lung mass is again seen.  No
 definite vascular congestion.  Left lung is essentially clear, though some
 haziness at the base could reflect some layering effusion.
