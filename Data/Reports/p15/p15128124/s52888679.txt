                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hyperglycemia.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  
 
 The lungs are grossly clear.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
 There is no vascular congestion or pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  Metallic density in the midline
 subdiaphragmatic region is likely related to prior abdominal surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2) Unusual density in the region of the GE junction could be related to prior
 abdominal surgery. If there is no relevant history of surgery, the ddx could
 include an ingested foreign body.
