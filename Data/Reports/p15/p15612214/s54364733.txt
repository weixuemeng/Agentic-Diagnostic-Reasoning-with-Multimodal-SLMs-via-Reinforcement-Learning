                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The heart size is
 mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There
 is mild pulmonary edema, and small bilateral pleural effusions, the latter of
 which appear minimally increased compared to the prior exam.  Consolidative
 opacity in the retrocardiac region likely reflects compressive atelectasis
 though infection is difficult to exclude.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral
 pleural effusions, slightly increased from the prior exam.  Left basilar
 opacity likely reflects atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded.
