                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with seizures.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___ and ___.
 
 The patient is after partial sternotomy.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 stable.  There is interval resolution of pulmonary edema.  Minimal linear
 opacity in the right lower lung might potentially reflect area of atelectasis
 or infectious process (less likely).  Left apical opacity is unchanged and
 most likely reflects post-radiation changes related to the upper thorax.
