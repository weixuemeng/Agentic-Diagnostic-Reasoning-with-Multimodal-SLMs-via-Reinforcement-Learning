                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, presenting with right-sided
 chest pain, shortness of breath and fatigue.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is again status post coronary artery bypass graft
 surgery.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  What is
 new, however, is a new mild interstitial abnormality primarily affecting the
 right lower lobe with a very small pleural effusion on the right as well as
 thickened fissures.  Particularly since other portions of the lungs appear
 essentially clear, an infectious process is favored based on the imaging,
 although atypical pulmonary edema is difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right lower lobe opacity concerning for pneumonia.  Vascular
 congestion seems less likely based on the imaging appearance, but correlation
 with clinical presentation is recommended.
