                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoglycemia.  Question aspiration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Patchy opacity in
 the right lower lung is non-specific, but aspiration, pneumonia or substantial
 atelectasis could be considered.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy medial right lower lung opacity worrisome for pneumonia,
 and in the appropriate setting, aspiration or atelectasis could be considered.
 Short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful to assess further, preferably
 with standard PA and lateral technique, if feasible.
