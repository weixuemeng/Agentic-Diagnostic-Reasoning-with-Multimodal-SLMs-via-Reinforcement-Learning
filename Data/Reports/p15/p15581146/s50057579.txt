 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  history of fall, to assess for interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-erect portable chest view was read in comparison with
 prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Increased retrocardiac density and left lower lung opacities likely a
 combination of atelectasis an/or consolidation and small effusion.  However,
 if any of this opacity represents infection, cannot be ruled out.  Mild
 atelectasis is present at the right lung base.  Upper lungs are clear.  Heart
 size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Atherosclerotic calcification in the arch and descending thoracic aorta is
 severe.
