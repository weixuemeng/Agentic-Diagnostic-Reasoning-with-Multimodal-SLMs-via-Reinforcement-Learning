                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and productive cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits. An opacity in the left lower lung obscuring the left cardiac
 border is not well seen on the lateral view but probably represents pneumonia
 within the lingula. Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear. There no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity in the left lower lung suggesting pneumonia probably in the lingula.
