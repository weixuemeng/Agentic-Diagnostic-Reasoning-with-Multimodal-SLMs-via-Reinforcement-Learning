                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 8 A.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after AVR and CABG.  Evaluate possible pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Since ___, the feeding tube has been removed.  Right supraclavicular
 central venous dialysis catheter is unchanged in position in the right atrium,
 and a left subclavian line still ends in the upper SVC.
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has increased, and there is
 still substantial distention of mediastinal and pulmonary vasculature with a
 suggestion of early edema in the left lower lung.  Small-to-moderate right
 pleural effusion and a tiny left pleural effusion are slightly larger. 
 Greater opacification at the right lung base could be due to early edema, but
 raises concern for aspiration or at least new atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  
 
 ___ was paged at 9 a.m. when the findings were recognized.
