 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Assessment for lymphadenopathy, parenchymal changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  A hyperlucency over the left inferior hemithorax is obviously due
 to a lumpectomy or mastectomy.  Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia, no other relevant parenchymal changes.  No
 lung nodules or masses.  No pleural effusions.  A right dialysis catheter over
 the internal jugular vein is unremarkable.
