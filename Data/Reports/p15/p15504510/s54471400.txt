                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  In the right lower lobe, there
 is a new opacity.  In the left lower lobe, there is a smaller and more subtle
 opacity adjacent to the apex of the heart.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is increased
 AP diameter consistent with COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe opacity, new since prior study as well as a more
 subtle left lower lobe opacity, both of which may indicate pneumonia or
 aspiration.
