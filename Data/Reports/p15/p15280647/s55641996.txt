                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with h/o prostate Ca.  Now with unexplained ___
 lb. weight loss  // r/o underlying pathology
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Borderline
 size of the cardiac silhouette. Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No
 evidence of lung parenchymal pathologies, in particular no evidence of primary
 or secondary neoplastic disease.  The sagittal diameter of the thorax is
 slightly increased, potentially suggesting overinflation.  No pleural
 effusions. If clinical symptoms persist, CT should be performed, given the
 higher sensitivity in the detection of small or mediastinal lesions.
