                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Borderline enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated with
 coronary artery stents re- visualized on the lateral view.  Aorta remains
 mildly tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are unchanged.
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal in the lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Lungs are mildly
 hyperinflated. 4 mm nodular opacity projecting over the right lung apex is
 noted, which could be within the lung or osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 2. 4 mm nodular opacity projecting over the right lung apex. It is unclear if
 this lies within the lung or osseous structures. Further assessment with
 shallow oblique imaging is recommended.
