 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  HIV who aspirated and had coughing spell with LOC.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 minimal left base atelectasis.  There is persistent blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angle.  This may be due to very trace pleural effusion.  No focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable minimal blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles may
 be due to trace pleural effusions.  No significant interval change.
