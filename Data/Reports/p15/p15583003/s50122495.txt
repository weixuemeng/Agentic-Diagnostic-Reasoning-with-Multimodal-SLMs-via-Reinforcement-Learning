                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is again
 noted to be significant elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Spinal
 stabilization hardware is noted in the lower C-spine.  There is subtle
 reticular opacity in the left lower lobe which could represent very early
 pneumonia in the right clinical setting.  No large pleural effusion is seen. 
 Heart size appears essentially stable, though the right heart border is
 obscured.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.  No
 definite signs of free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Elevated right hemidiaphragm, unchanged.  Subtle reticular left
 lower lobe opacity may represent a very early pneumonia.
