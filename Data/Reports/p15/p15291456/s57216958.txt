                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient three months status post autotransplant
 for multiple myeloma, now with fevers and productive cough, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains normal.  No
 configurational abnormalities seen.  Mild degree of general thoracic widening
 and elongation but stable in comparison with previous study.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal
 infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are
 free.  Similar as on the preceding examination, there are multiple rib
 abnormalities with locally distended structures of the ribs, but no acute
 fractures are seen.  These osseous changes in this patient with history of
 multiple myeloma appear stable and no significant interval change can be
 identified.  The same holds for the appearance of the thoracic spine with at
 least two vertebral bodies that are reduced in height.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no evidence of acute infiltrate.
