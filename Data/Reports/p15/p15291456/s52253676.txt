                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with febrile neutropenia.
 
 STUDY:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right-sided central line
 with its tip in the upper SVC.  The heart size is at the upper limits of
 normal, also exaggerated by AP projection.  The mediastinal contours
 demonstrate a mildly tortuous aorta.  The lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Irregularity of multiple right ribs along
 with pleural thickening may represent sequelae of multiple myeloma, but no new
 chest wall abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post right central line placement without complication; no
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
