                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Difficulty swallowing pills, now presenting with cough.  Concern
 for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate very low lung volumes
 and probable bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis, though consolidation
 cannot be excluded.  Bilateral small pleural effusions are also present.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears widened due to low lung volumes.  There
 is no pneumothorax. Old right mid clavicular fracture is noted.
