                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of slurred speech.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Mild
 bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  Subtle opacity at the right lung base most
 likely represents atelectasis, less likely consolidation.  No definite
 discrete focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Degenerative changes are seen along the
 spine.
