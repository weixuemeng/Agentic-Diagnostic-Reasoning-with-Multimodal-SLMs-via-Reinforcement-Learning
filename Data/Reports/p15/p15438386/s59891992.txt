                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again, there are low lung volumes.  Mild blunting of the costophrenic angles
 may in part relate to low lung volumes with likely trace pleural effusions. 
 Additional subtle bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis.  The
 patient is rotated to the right.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 similar with the cardiac silhouette possibly slightly less prominent as
 compared to the prior study.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Chronic
 deformity of the right clavicle is again noted.
