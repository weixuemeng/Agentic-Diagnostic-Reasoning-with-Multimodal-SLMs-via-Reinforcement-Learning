                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever with pneumonia on outside chest radiograph, now
 tachypneic requiring increased oxygen, here to evaluate for pulmonary edema or
 worsening infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiograph performed at ___ dated ___
 and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is patchy opacification at the right lower lung with a
 slightly nodular appearance below the right hilus lateral to the right heart
 border.  There is mild blunting at the right costophrenic angle which may
 represent a small amount of pleural fluid.  No pneumothorax is detected.  A
 slightly spiculated density projecting over the left lung apex is noted
 measuring approximately 1.4 x 1.2 cm.  The heart is enlarged with increased
 prominence of the right heart contour from the prior study of ___.  The
 cardiac silhouette is slightly water bottle suggestive of possible pericardial
 effusion.  The thoracic aorta is unfolded and mildly tortuous.  The
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits and unchanged from ___.  The
 trachea is midline.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right lower lung consolidation compatible with pneumonia.  Nodular
 opacities within the consolidation lateral to the right heart border raised
 the possibility of underlying pulmonary nodule or mass.
 
 2.  1.4-cm spiculated mass in the left lung apex.  Comparison with prior or
 subsequent chest CT would be helpful for further evaluation.
 
 3.  Water bottle shaped cardiac silhouette concerning for pericardial effusion
 or cardiomegaly increased from ___.
 
 Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 2
 a.m. on ___.
