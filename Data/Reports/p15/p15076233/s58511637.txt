  The image is obtained in a lordotic position making evaluation somewhat
  difficult.  The tip of the enteric tube may be in the stomach but the side
  port is likely in the esophagus.  To place all portions safely in the stomach
  the enteric tube should be advanced approximately 10 cm.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Sepsis and dilated stomach, now with NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  The NG tube is at the gastroesophageal junction, slightly too high.
 At the time of dictating this film, subsequent study had already been
 performed.  The heart is moderately enlarged, increased compared to prior. 
 There is pulmonary vascular re-distribution.  There are bilateral lower lobe
 greater than upper lobe alveolar infiltrates.  There are small bilateral
 effusions.  The overall impression is that of fluid overload. Underlying
 infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.  Sternal wires and mediastinal clips
 are again seen.
