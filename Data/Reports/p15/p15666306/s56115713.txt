                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen pelvis ___ at 09:24
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation.  Right internal jugular
 central venous catheter tip terminates in the region of the mid SVC.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Ill-defined hazy opacity within the left lung base
 appears progressed compared to the previous chest radiograph, which could
 reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema given the rapid interval progression.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Subsegmental atelectasis is
 noted in the left mid lung field.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the mid SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
  2.  Ill-defined hazy opacity in the left lung base, progressed compared to
 the prior CT, concerning for asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Follow-up PA and
 lateral radiographs are recommended.
