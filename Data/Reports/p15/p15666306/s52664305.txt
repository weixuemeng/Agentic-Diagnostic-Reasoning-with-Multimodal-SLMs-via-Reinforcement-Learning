                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman w/ sepsis s/p rectal abscess drainage, now w/
 productive cough, 4L O2 requirement w/ sats in low 90s  // new O2 requirement?
 new O2 requirement?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased hazy opacification
 at the bases with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with
 layering pleural effusions and underlying compressive atelectasis.  Cardiac
 silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size.  Given the underlying
 effusions, the pulmonary vasculature is difficult to assess, though appears to
 be mildly engorged.
 Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with substantial volume loss in the
 left lower lobe.
