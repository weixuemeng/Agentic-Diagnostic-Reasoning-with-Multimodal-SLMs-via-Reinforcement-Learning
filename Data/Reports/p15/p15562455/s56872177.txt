                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and chest pain, here to evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.  
 
 Technique:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  Patchy opacity in the right
 middle is better seen on the lateral view.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  There is no
 free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacity in the right middle lobe, suggestive of pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical context.
