                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Bicycle injury, possible clavicle injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are relatively low lung volumes that accentuate the
 bronchovascular markings.  Basilar atelectasis is seen without definite focal
 consolidation.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. 
 There is a displaced mid right clavicular fracture with approximately 1.3 cm
 of bony overriding and with inferior displacement of the distal fracture
 fragment by approximately one shaft width.  Partially imaged hardware in the
 mid to distal left clavicle is noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Displaced right midclavicular fracture.
