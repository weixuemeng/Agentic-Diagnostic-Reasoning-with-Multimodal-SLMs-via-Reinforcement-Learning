 location of ET tube
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs.
 
 New ET tube in standard placement.  Even the patient has been intubated lung
 volumes have improved, severe heterogeneous infiltrative pulmonary abnormality
 is no better, probably worse.  Although some of it may be pulmonary edema the
 heterogeneity is strongly suggestive of concurrent pneumonia.  Heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal veins are not engorged.  Bilateral pleural effusion is at
 least small.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Nasogastric drainage tube ends in the stomach.  Right jugular line ends in the
 low SVC.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  It is important to obtain prior chest imaging to assess
 the radiographic history of recurrent abnormalities.
