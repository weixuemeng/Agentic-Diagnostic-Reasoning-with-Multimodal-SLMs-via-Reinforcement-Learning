                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxic respiratory failure influenza
 positive with pulm edema requiring intubation  // eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to the prior radiograph of 2 days earlier, support and
 monitoring devices remain in standard position.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable.  Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities have slightly improved,
 likely due to improving pulmonary edema.  Residual opacities involving the
 right lung to a greater degree than the left likely reflect a combination of
 residual edema and infectious pneumonia.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions
 are again demonstrated.
