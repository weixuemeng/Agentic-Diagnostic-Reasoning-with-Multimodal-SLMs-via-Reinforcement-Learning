                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with pneumonia with acute onset shortness of breath and
 hypoxia.  // Please eval for pneumonia, acute process.      Please eval for
 pneumonia, acute process.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the Dobhoff tube lies in
 the antrum of the stomach.  The cardiac silhouette appears at the upper limits
 of normal in size.  Engorgement of poorly defined pulmonary vessels is
 consistent with substantial elevation in pulmonary venous pressure. Bibasilar
 opacifications are consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the
 lower lobes, especially on the left.  However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially
 in the absence of a lateral view.
