                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with T1DM and dCHF presented to OSH with
 dyspnea, initially thought to be pneumonia, but radiograph improved with
 diuresis, but now oliguric and ___ after aggressive diuresis initially  //
 Pulmonary edema? Consolidation?    Pulmonary edema? Consolidation?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 Heterogeneous pulmonary abnormality.  Regions Of interstitial infiltration
 could be edema, but more discrete areas of consolidation and nodulation, left
 midlung, could be explained instead by widespread infection.  Left hilus may
 be enlarged.  Cardiac silhouette is partially obscured and size is difficult
 to assess, but it is not very large.  Pleural effusions are presumed, could be
 moderate on the left.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Right jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 It is very important to obtain prior chest imaging, both recent and remote to
 determine the chronicity of current lung abnormalities.
