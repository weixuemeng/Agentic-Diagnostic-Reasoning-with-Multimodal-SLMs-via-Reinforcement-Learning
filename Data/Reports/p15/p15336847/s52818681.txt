                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ETT/sepsis  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs most recent dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The projection precludes meaningful comment on the heart size.  The
 cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged however.  A right-sided internal
 jugular catheter is in-situ, the tip is at the cavoatrial junction.  The tip
 of a nasogastric tube is outside of the field of view abuts right below the
 diaphragm.  Lung volumes are slightly improved when compared to the prior
 study.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen.  Minimal retrocardiac
 atelectasis is stable compared to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.
