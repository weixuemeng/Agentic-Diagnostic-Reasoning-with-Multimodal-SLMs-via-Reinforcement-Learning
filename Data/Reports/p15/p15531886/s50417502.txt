                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Known right sided pulmonary mass history of non-small-cell lung
 cancer here with worsening shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm as also seen on outside hospital CT from ___. 
 Again demonstrated is a large right-sided mass, which on CT was seen to invade
 the mediastinum from the right.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  No new focal consolidation is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette is unremarkable.  Lower right peritracheal opacity likely relates
 to the right-sided mass which extends into the mediastinum.
