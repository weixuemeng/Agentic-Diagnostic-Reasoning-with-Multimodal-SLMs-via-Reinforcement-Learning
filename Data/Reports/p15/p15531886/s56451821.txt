                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___F with tumor burden, recent Y stent placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Large right perihilar mass
 is again seen and not significantly changed.  More extensive streaky right
 basilar opacities are seen which may be due to atelectasis, especially given
 relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm perhaps slightly more so than on
 prior.  Tracheal stent is identified.  The left lung is grossly clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right perihilar mass as on prior.  Linear right basilar
 opacities, most suggestive of atelectasis.
