                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Assess for interval resolution of the right lower lobe pneumonia
 seen in ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate improvement but not
 resolution of a right lower lobe opacity, which could represent residual
 disease.  A left lower lobe opacity is not well seen today, and could
 represent resolution of a focus of multifocal pneumonia or atelectasis versus
 obscure a shin of a prominent fat pad by the left hemidiaphragm.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 A right lower lobe opacity is decreased but still minimally present and could
 represent residual disease.  Recommend followup chest radiograph in 4 weeks.
 
 These findings were entered into the critical communications dashboard by Dr.
 ___ at 17:56 on ___.
