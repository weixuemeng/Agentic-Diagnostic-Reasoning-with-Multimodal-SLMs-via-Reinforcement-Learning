                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Mr. ___ is a ___M history of hypertensive nephropathy s/p
 LRRT in ___, diastolic CHF, HTN, HLD, afib (not on AC) presenting with
 nonbloody, nonbilious emesis found to have elevated troponins likely ___ CHF.
 S/p cardiac cath revealing large lesion to LAD which had diffuse ___% stenosis.
 Cath on ___ with placement of DES in LAD. In process of being evaluated for
 MitraClip procedure. Concerned with steadily increasing leukocytosis with no
 clear source of infection  // ?Aspiration PNA?Aspiration PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with diffuse pulmonary opacifications consistent with the
 clinical diagnosis of pulmonary edema which may be worse than on the previous
 study.  Bilateral pleural effusions are best seen on the lateral view.
 Although no specific coalescent area is identified.  In view of the extensive
 pulmonary abnormalities, it would be very difficult to exclude superimposed
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
