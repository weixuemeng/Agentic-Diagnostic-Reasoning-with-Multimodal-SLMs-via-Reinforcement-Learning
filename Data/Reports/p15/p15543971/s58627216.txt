 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse parenchymal opacities have improved slightly consistent with pulmonary

 difficult to exclude especially without the lateral view.  A small left
 calcified granuloma is unchanged.  Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis is stable.
 Small bilateral pleural effusion is unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged but stable.  The mediastinum is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Improved pulmonary edema.
 
 2. With the underlying diffuse opacities, definitive consolidation is
 difficult to exclude especially without the lateral view.
