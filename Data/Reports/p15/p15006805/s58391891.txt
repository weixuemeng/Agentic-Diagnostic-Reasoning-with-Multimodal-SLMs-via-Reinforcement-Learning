                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain, shortness of breath for 1 day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is moderately enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. The
 aortic knob is calcified.  Patchy ill-defined opacities are seen within the
 right mid lung field as well as within the lung bases bilaterally, more so on
 the right. Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of diaphragms suggestive of
 COPD. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, and no pulmonary edema is
 demonstrated.  Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities within the right mid lung field and both lung bases. These
 findings could reflect areas of infection and followup radiographs after
 treatment are recommended to ensure resolution.
