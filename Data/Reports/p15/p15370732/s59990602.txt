                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with abdominal pain and distention.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and PET-CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. The left pectoral pacemaker leads
 end in the expected locations of the right atrium and right ventricle.  There
 is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is seen.  The known FDG-avid nodules seen on recent PET-CT are
 below the threshold of detection on chest radiograph.  Heart size is within
 normal limits allowing for lung volumes.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are stable. Blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus is similar to
 ___, although no effusion is seen on CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
