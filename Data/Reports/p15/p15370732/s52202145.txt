 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 nasogastric tube.  The course of the tube through the esophagus is
 unremarkable.  The tip of the tube appears to project over the very proximal
 parts of the stomach, the tube should be advanced by approximately 5 cm.
 
 Otherwise, there is no relevant change.  No complications such as
 pneumothorax.
