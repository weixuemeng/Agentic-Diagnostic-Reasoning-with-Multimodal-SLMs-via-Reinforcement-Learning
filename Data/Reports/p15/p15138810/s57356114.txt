                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  A new area
 of consolidation has developed in the left lower lobe, predominantly in the
 retrocardiac area, and a more subtle area of opacity has developed in the
 right infrahilar region.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are also new.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New bibasilar opacities, most prominent in the left retrocardiac region. 
 These findings may be due to acute aspiration or developing pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful
 in this regard.
 2.  New small bilateral pleural effusions.
