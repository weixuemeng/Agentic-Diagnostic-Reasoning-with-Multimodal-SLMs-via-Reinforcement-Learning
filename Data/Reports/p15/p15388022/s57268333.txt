 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Cardiac silhouette
 size is top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Increased interstitial opacities are
 noted in lung bases bilaterally, similar to that seen on the previous chest
 radiograph, and appear to correlate to a chronic interstitial abnormality
 better assessed on the previous CT.  No new focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are not arm moderate degenerative
 changes in the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Chronic interstitial abnormality at the
