                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with LUQ pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a partially calcified rounded density projecting over the mediastinum
 near the AP window compatible with calcified lymph nodes.  Several scattered
 punctate parenchymal densities, may be granulomas, sequela of prior
 granulomatous infection such as histoplasmosis versus vessels on end. Lungs
 are otherwise fully expanded and clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
