                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change in the bilateral areas of opacification with continued enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette.  The appearance most likely is consistent with a
 combination of multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary vascular congestion.
