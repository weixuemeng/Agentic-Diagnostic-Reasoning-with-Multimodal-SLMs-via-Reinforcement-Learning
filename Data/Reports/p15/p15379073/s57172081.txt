 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough, congestion, and persistent fevers.

 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Ill-defined opacities

 are indistinct.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable.  No substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Multifocal ill-defined opacities are new and consistent with atypical
 pneumonia.  Indistinct appearance of the pulmonary vasculature suggests
 concurrent early heart failure.
