                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Assess for effusion and cardiac surgery.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued increased
 opacification at the left base consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe
 and pleural effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 right lung is essentially clear.
