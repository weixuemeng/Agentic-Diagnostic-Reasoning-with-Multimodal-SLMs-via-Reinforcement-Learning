                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Ascending aorta repair, to assess for pulmonary disease.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 somewhat better inspiration.  Continued opacification at the left base is
 consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion.  Minimal
 thickening of the minor fissure suggests some pleural fluid on the right as
 well.
 
 No evidence of vascular congestion.
