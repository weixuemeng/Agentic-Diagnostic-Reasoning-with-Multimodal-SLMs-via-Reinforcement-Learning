                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with congestive cardiac failure who presents
 from rehab with right thigh pain and shortness of breath.  Assess for
 pulmonary edema, pneumonia or other abnormalities.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Mild cardiomegaly is increased compared to the
 prior exam.  Bilateral interstitial edema is improved. New focal nodularity
 particularly within the left lung are concerning for disseminated infection.
 Prominence and some minimal opacification at the right lung base may represent
 atelectasis or worsening pulmonary edema, although infection cannot be
 entirely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Interstitial edema is improved compared to the prior exam.
 2. Mild cardiomegaly is increased compared to the prior exam.
 3. Focal nodularity predominantly in left lung, new since the prior exam, is
 concerning for disseminated infection. A dedicated CT of the chest is
 recommended for further evaluation. 
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 11:30am on ___ via telephone.
