                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with recent CHF and a diagnosis of amyloidosis
 on chemo with lethargy and generalized weakness.  Assess for evidence of
 pulmonary pathology.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well inflated.  Slightly increased interstitial
 marking are seen but there is no confluent consolidation.  There is a moderate
 cardiomegaly with a mildly prominent azygos vein. There is a small right sided
 pleural effusion. There is a tortuous aorta, but the mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 Degenerative changes are noted about the right AC joint.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, small right pleural effusion with a prominent azygos
 vein and increased interstitial markings suggest mild failure.
