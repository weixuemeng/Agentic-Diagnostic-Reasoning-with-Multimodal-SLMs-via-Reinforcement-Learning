                                 FINAL REPORT

 there  pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has improved since ___, 6:28 a.m. 
 Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions persist.  Opacification in the
 lower lungs has been greater than the remainder since at least ___.  I
 attribute this to atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded.  
 
 Given normal heart size and the absence of mediastinal vascular engorgement,
 at the time this radiograph was taken, cardiac decompensation had probably
 resolved.
 
 Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Left PIC line ends in
 the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
