 WET READ: ___ ___ 12:27 PM
  1. Findings worrisome for developing pneumonia within superior segment of left
  lower lobe with small pleural effusion.2. Tubular right upper lobe 1.9 cm
  opacity is most consistent with mucous plugging however a small pulmonary
  nodule would be similar in appearance.  Recommend followup chest radiograph in
  6 weeks after resolution of symptoms to assess for clearance.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with 4 days of cough.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature.  In comparison to ___ there has been interval resolution of a right lower lobe opacity.
 A new tubular 1.9 x 0.5 cm right upper lobe opacity is most consistent with
 mucous plugging however a small pulmonary nodule with the similar in
 appearance.  Interval increase in a heterogeneous opacity within the superior
 segment of the left lower lobe worrisome for developing pneumonia.  Small left
 pleural effusion is best assessed on lateral projection.
 
 A tracheostomy is noted.  There is mild rightward deviation of the trachea
 likely related to the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Findings worrisome for developing pneumonia within superior segment of
 left lower lobe with small pleural effusion.
 2.  Tubular right upper lobe 1.9 cm opacity is most consistent with mucous
 plugging however a small pulmonary nodule would be similar in appearance. 
 Recommend followup chest radiograph in 6 weeks after resolution of symptoms to
 assess for clearance.
