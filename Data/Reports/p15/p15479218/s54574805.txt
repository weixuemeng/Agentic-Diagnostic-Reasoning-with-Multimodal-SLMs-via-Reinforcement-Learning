                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aspiration pna and pleural effusions, vent
 dependent  // cario pulm process      cario pulm process
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 05:21
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 05:18 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian PICC line, endotracheal tube, right pleural pigtail catheter,
 and feeding tube are likely unchanged in position. There are worsening
 layering effusions with associated patchy airspace disease more likely
 reflecting atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. No
 evidence of pulmonary edema. The pulmonary vessels do appear somewhat
 cephalized which suggests pulmonary venous hypertension. No pneumothorax.
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given
 differences in positioning.
