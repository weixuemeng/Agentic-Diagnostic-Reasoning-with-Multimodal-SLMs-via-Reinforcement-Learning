                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cholangiocarcinoma, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged moderate
 cardiomegaly, low lung volumes, and minimal fluid overload.  A small left
 pleural effusion is likely present.  Left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged,
 also unchanged is the marked increase in diameter of the right pulmonary
 artery.  The quality of the radiographic penetration is limited, so that the
 assessment for potential metastatic lesions should better be performed on CT,
 if clinically relevant.
