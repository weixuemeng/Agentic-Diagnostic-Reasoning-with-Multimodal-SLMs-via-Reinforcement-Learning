                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with common bile duct stone.  Evaluation for
 acute pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A pacemaker generator overlies the left
 anterior chest wall.  The leads appear intact and project over the expected
 location of the right atrium and right ventricle.  The lung volumes are low. 
 Bibasilar opacities likely represent dependent atelectasis.  No large pleural
 effusion is identified.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, though
 no overt edema.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Calcifications are noted within the aortic arch.  The cardiac silhouette is
 severely enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Intact pacemaker leads in standard position.
 2.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, though no overt edema or large pleural
 effusions.
 4.  Severe cardiomegaly.
