                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant pain after ERCP.  Evaluate for free air under
 diaphragm.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is moderately enlarged with tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta.  A left anterior chest wall dual-lead pacer is unchanged compared to
 prior study.  There is poor inspiratory effort with associated bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary edema appears similar to prior study.  There is
 no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The osseous structures are grossly
 unremarkable.  There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum.  Stents identified in
 the right upper quadrant, presumably biliary.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema.  Although there is no clear worrisome consolidative
 focus, underlying infectious process cannot be excluded given the appropriate
 clinical circumstance.
 2.  No evidence of pneumoperitoneum.
