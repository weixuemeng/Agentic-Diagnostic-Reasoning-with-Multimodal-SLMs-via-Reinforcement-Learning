                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a cough for several days, possible left lower
 lobe infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to the only prior chest radiograph
 available, ___:
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has resolved, and the pulmonary vasculature is
 no longer particularly engorged.  Severe cardiomegaly persists and the
 pulmonary hila are large enough to reflect pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary abnormality probably reflects previous episodes of
 congestive heart failure.  There is no atelectasis or consolidation and no
 pleural effusion.  Marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm anteriorly is
 probably due to eventration.  Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular
 pacer leads are unchanged in their respective locations.  The ventricular lead
 ends close to the interventricular septum.  Thoracic aorta is generally large,
 tortuous and heavily calcified but not focally aneurysmal, and unchanged over
 six weeks.
