                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post ERCP with chills and low-grade
 temps, evaluate for infection.  
 
 COMPARISONS:  CTA chest from ___ and multiple chest radiographs,
 most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  A left chest wall
 pacemaker is present with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle. 
 Compared to the prior study, there has been improvement in pulmonary vascular
 congestion and aeration at the left base.  Lung volumes remain low.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are present, left greater than right.  There is no
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Right hilar opacity is stable and
 consistent with an enlarged pulmonary artery as seen on CT.  Multiple
 pulmonary nodules identified on the recent CTA chest are not definitively
 identified.  There are degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.  The imaged
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improvement of pulmonary vascular congestion and improved aeration at the
 left base.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
