                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, chills and back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs
 are low in volume but clear aside from minimal basal/retrocardiac atelectasis
 or scarring.  Interstitial prominence is likely due to chronic changes related
 to the congestive heart failure.  No overt pulmonary edema or vascular
 congestion seen currently.  The heart remains moderately enlarged with
 tortuous aortic contour.  Dual lead pacemaker is noted.  No pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
