                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with questionable aspiration pneumonia, interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable single frontal chest radiograph was then obtained.
 
 The patient is status post intubation.  The tip of the ET tube terminates 5 cm
 above the carina.  A right IJ tip terminates at the mid SVC and a left PICC
 line and left subclavian line also terminate at the mid SVC.  The NG tube is
 coiled in the fundus of the stomach.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Subsegmental atelectasis is present in right mid lung
 zone and the right lung base.  Left lower lung opacity is likely secondary to
 layering pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Small left pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis. 
 
 2. Right mid and lower lung atelectasis.  No focal consolidation.
