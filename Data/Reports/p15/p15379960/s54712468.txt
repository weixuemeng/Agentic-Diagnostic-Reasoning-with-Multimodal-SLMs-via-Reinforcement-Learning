                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views were reviewed and compared to the prior study.  Low lung
 volumes limits the evaluation; however, there is a possible retrocardiac
 opacification.  There is no vascular congestion, or pneumothorax.  The heart
 size is likely normal considering the low lung volumes.  There are no
 concerning osseous or soft tissue lesions.
 
 IMPRESSION: A possible retrocardiac opacification could represent atelectasis;
 however, in the appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia has to be considered.
