                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle raising concern for a small
 left pleural effusion.  Left base streaky retrocardiac opacity may relate to
 pleural effusion and atelectasis although an underlying consolidation is not
 excluded.  The right lung is clear.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle raises concern for small pleural
 effusion with overlying atelectasis, patchy left base retrocardiac opacity may
 relate to pleural effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation not
 excluded.
