                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Septic shock, increased oxygen requirement.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  Increasing opacities in the left lower lobe could
 be due to increasing atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded.  There is no pneumothorax or large effusions.  Sternal wires are
 aligned.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
