  Heterogeneous opacity within lower lobe only seen on lateral projection most
  likely represents atelectasis however clinical correlation is recommended to
  assess for early pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Fever. Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Lungs are grossly clear on the frontal
 view. Questionable opacity overlying the lower thoracic spine on the lateral
 view without silhouetting of the diaphragm contours may be due to
 superimposition of normal structures due to suboptimal positioning on the
 lateral radiograph
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite pneumonia. If clinical suspicion for infection persists, repeat
 lateral radiograph with improved positioning may be helpful to fully exclude a
 lower lobe pneumonia.
