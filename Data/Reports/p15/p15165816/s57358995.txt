                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with DM, HTN, CAD p/w right MCA stroke  // R/O CHF,
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes. Bibasilar atelectasis is seen without
 focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are likely exaggerated by low lung volumes. The
 aorta is tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.
 There may be mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement, without overt
 pulmonary edema. There is anterior wedging of a vertebral body at the
 thoracolumbar junction, of indeterminate age.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Relatively low lung volumes. Bibasilar atelectasis without definite focal
 consolidation. Mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement, without overt
 pulmonary edema.
 
 Anterior wedging of a lower thoracic vertebral body of indeterminate age.
 Correlate clinically for acuity.
