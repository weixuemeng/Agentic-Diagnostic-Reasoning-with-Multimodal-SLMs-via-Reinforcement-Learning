                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, cough  // infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are normal.  There is patchy consolidation on the left,
 suspicious for pneumonia.  On the frontal view, it appears to be silhouetting
 the left heart border, which suggests that it is located in the lingula. 
 However, on the lateral view, this consolidation appears to be localized to
 the left upper lobe.  Heart is normal in size.  There is ipsilateral hilar
 prominence, likely representing reactive lymphadenopathy.  Small pleural
 effusion.  No pleural effusion on the right.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left upper lobe pneumonia, with a small associated pleural effusion and
 probably reactive hilar lymphadenopathy.
