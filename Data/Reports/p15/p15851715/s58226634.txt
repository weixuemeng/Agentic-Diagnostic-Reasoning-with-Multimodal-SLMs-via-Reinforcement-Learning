                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with wheezing, cough.  Study requested
 to rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 Low lung volumes due to suboptimal inspiratory effort accentuate the
 bronchovascular structures.  There is atelectasis of the right mid lung. 
 There are no definite focal consolidations, however, for a more thorough
 evaluation, repeat examination is recommended with full insipration. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right mid lung atelectasis and crowding of bronchovascular
 structures due to suboptimal inspiratory effort.  Recommend repeat examination
 with full inspiration.
