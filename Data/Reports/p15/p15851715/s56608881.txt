                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with sudden onset of wheezing,
 evaluate for any acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.  The heart size is within normal limits. 
 No typical configurational abnormality is identified.  Thoracic aorta is
 mildly widened and elongated but without local contour abnormalities or walled
 calcifications.  Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No evidence of acute
 or chronic pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are present, and the lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No signs of pneumothorax in the apical
 area.  Skeletal structures demonstrate mild degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine, but no evidence of vertebral body compression fracture is
 noted.
 
 In comparison with the next previous examination, the at that time identified
 poor inspiration with crowded pulmonary vasculature and plate atelectasis on
 the bases has normalized.  Presently, the lungs are clear without evidence of
 acute infiltrates or evidence of pulmonary congestion.  The lateral view
 discloses rather prominent surrounding soft tissue structures indicative of
 adiposity.
