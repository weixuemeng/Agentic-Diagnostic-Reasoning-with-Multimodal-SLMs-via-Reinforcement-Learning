 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with known bilateral effusions seen on CT chest. 
 // ? change in bilateral effusions / establish baseline CXR for later
 comparison      ? change in bilateral effusions / establish baseline CXR for
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 04:48
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. The layering
 bilateral effusions are likely not changed.  Associated bibasilar airspace
 opacity most likely reflects compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia can
 not be excluded.   No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax.
