  Since the prior study, obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm by left basilar
  atelectasis and pleural effusion is more conspicuous, likely partially
  positional, although small increase in size of left pleural effusion is
  likely, given left lateral chest wall soft tissue swelling, presumably due to
  third spacing of fluid.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increasing dyspnea in setting of saline
 infusion.  // ? pulmonary edema      ? pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is probably mild increase in
 the left pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis at the base, although
 this could merely be related to change in patient position. Otherwise, little
 change.
