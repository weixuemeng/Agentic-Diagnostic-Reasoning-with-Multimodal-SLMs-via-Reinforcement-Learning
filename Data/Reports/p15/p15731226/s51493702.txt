                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent pleural effusions with continued
 dyspnea and decreased breath sounds at ___ base.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates persistent but decreased right
 pleural effusion.  This appears to be a lenticular opacity laterally at the
 right base on frontal views raises possibility of a loculated pleural
 component. The lungs are otherwise clear with no focal opacity convincing for
 pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent right pleural effusion, much decreased since prior examination. 
 Lenticular shape on the frontal view may raises the possibility of loculation.
