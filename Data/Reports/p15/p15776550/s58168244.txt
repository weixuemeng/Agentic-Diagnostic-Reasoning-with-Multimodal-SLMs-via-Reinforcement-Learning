                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath after IV fluid administration at an outside
 hospital.  Evaluate for edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal chest radiographs demonstrate a nasogastric tube which extends below
 the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  There is asymmetric increased opacity of the right
 hemithorax with multiple areas of consolidation, most prominent in the upper
 lobe. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  A metallic density is seen
 projecting over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Multiple areas of consolidation in the right lung, consistent with
 multifocal pneumonia, possibly related to aspiration.
 2. A metallic density projecting over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen
 , possibly a catheter tip.
