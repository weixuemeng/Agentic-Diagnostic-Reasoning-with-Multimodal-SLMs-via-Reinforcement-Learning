                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pleural effusion.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Large left pleural effusion is demonstrated, associated with a right
 mediastinal shift with substantial opacification of the left lower lung, most
 likely consistent with underlying atelectasis, although mass or pleural lesion
 cannot be excluded.  Left upper lung and right lung appear to be clear. 
 Pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Cardiac silhouette cannot be assessed given the obscuration of the
 left cardiac border by pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
