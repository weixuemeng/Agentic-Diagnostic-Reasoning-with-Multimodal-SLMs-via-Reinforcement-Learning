                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 4:41 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath after pleural drainage.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, ___ p.m.:
 
 Moderate left and small right pleural effusions are both slightly smaller.
 Greater opacification in the lower lungs due largely to pulmonary metastases
 has increased and is most readily explained by mild pulmonary edema but
 pulmonary hemorrhage is an alternative and given the severe extent of
 pulmonary metastasis, I would probably not recognize early pneumonia.  The
 heart is not enlarged.  Infusion port ends in the right atrium.  No
 pneumothorax.
