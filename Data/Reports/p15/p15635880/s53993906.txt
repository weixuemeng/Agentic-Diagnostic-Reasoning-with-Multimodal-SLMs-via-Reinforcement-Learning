 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the known pre-existing
 multiple bilateral lung nodules have not substantially changed in size and
 distribution.  However, there is a massive increase in extent of the left
 pleural effusion.  The effusion now occupies approximately one-third of the
 left hemithorax.  Moreover, areas of basal atelectasis have newly appeared.
 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged left pectoral
 Port-A-Cath.
