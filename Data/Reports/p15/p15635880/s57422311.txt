 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation.  There is unchanged
 evidence of multiple massive bilateral diffuse pulmonary nodules and now
 bilateral, left more than right pleural effusion.  Unchanged size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged right pectoral Port-A-Cath.
