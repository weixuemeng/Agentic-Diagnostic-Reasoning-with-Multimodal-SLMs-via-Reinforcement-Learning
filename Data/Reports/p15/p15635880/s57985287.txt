                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath, reported consolidation at
 outside hospital.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  A Port-A-Cath
 resides over the left chest wall with catheter tip extending to the level of
 the low SVC.  Diffuse metastatic disease is again seen with interval increase
 in bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  A left chest tube is
 in place, not significantly changed in position from prior.  A previously
 noted right basal chest tube is not clearly seen and may have been removed in
 the interval.  Left basal consolidation appears increased from prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing effusions and lower lung consolidations on a
 background of diffuse metastatic pulmonary disease.
