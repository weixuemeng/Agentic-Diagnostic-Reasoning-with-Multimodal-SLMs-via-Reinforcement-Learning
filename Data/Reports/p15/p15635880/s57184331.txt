                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with malignant pleural effusion status post
 placement of left Pleurx catheter.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest demonstrates interval placement of a left
 pleural tube.  There are two curvilinear opacities which are seen projecting
 over the left apex, but are difficult to discern secondary to projection of
 the bony structures in this area.  This may represent a small apical
 pneumothorax.  The left-sided port remains in standard position, unchanged
 since the prior study.  Multiple bilateral parenchymal opacities are again
 seen, consistent with metastatic breast cancer.  The heart size is unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval placement of a left pleural catheter with possible small
 left apical pneumothorax.  Otherwise, unchanged since the prior study.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ page at
 16:15, 5 minutes after the finding was discovered and was then subsequently
 discussed over the telephone.
