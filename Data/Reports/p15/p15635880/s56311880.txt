                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer, now with
 symptoms suspicious for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT scout image ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Study is essentially unchanged from comparison study.  There are
 multiple round nodular opacities which correlate with previously documented
 metastatic disease.  There are no areas of focal consolidation which are
 suspicious for pneumonia.  The left-sided Port-A-Cath is seen in position
 terminating appropriately within the mid SVC.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  The pleural surfaces are unremarkable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Evaluation for pneumonia is limited by the presence of multiple
 metastatic processes.  Though pneumonia cannot be ruled out, no consolidation
 suspicious for pneumonia was identified.
 
 These findings were reported to Dr. ___ at 11:08 a.m. via phone by
 ___.
