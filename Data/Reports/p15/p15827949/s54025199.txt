                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Catatonia.  Please rule out acute intrapulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.  The left
 hemidiaphragm is elevated and underlying loops of bowel are mildly distended. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  There is no evidence of acute intrapulmonary process.  
 
 2.  The left hemidiaphragm is elevated and underlying loops of bowel are
 mildly distended.  The elevation may be secondary to the loops of bowel,
 however, withour prior radiographs for comparison a causal relationship is
 difficult to establish.
