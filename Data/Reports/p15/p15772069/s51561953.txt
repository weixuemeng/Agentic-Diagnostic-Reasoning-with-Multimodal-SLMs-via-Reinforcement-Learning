 Small nodular opacities seen on prior PET-CT cannot be clearly seen on
 radiograph.  No evidence of congestion or edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Bony structures appear intact.  Chronic left anterior
 rib deformities likely account for increased sclerosis at the left second and
 third anterior rib arches.
