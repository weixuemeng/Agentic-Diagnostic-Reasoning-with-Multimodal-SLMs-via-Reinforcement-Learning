                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with s/p fall r/o infection  // eval ? PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Lung volumes are low
 and apparent interstitial opacities in the lung bases likely represents
 crowding of vascular structures. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent interstitial opacities in the lung bases, possibly due to crowding of
 bronchovascular structures related to low lung volumes. However, if clinical
 concern for pneumonia persists, PA and lateral views with greater inspiration
 effort are recommended.
