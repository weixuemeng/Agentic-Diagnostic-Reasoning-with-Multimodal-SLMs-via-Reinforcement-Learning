 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right chest tube is unchanged as compared to prior chest CT, with

 intact.  Tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position, terminating 5 cm above
 the carina.  A small to moderate sized right pleural effusion is again noted. 
 Peribronchial cuffing and diffuse airspace opacities are consistent with
 persistent pulmonary edema.  A calcified right hilar lymph node is again
 noted.  The mediastinal silhouette is stable.
