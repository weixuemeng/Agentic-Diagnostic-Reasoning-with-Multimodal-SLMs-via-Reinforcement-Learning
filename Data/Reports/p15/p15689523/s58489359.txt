                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with AMS, hypotension, vent, evaluate for PNA vs CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___
 and recent chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Extensive bibasilar opacities slightly improved compared with the prior study.
 A uniform opacity overlying the right lung field suggests at least a moderate
 pleural effusion.  A calcified right paratracheal structure corresponds to a
 calcified mediastinal lymph node.  The tracheostomy tube, a right-sided chest
 tube, right IJ central venous catheter, and right PICC line appear in
 unchanged position.  Sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Slight interval improvement in extensive bibasilar opacities.
 2. Persistent right pleural effusion.
 3. Unchanged position of lines and tubes.
