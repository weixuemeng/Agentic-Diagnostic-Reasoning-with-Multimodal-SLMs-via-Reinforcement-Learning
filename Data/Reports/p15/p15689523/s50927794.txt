 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tracheostomy tube is no longer visualized.  Diffuse bilateral interstitial
 opacities with perihilar predominance have increased as compared to the prior

 lobes.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged including engorgement of the azygos and central venous
 structures.

 1. Diffusely increased bilateral opacities with a perihilar predominance is
 consistent with worsening moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are overall unchanged.
