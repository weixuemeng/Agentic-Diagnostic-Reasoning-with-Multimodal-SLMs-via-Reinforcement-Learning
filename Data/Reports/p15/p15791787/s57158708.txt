                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post fall with decreased hematocrit,
 evaluate for rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged likely
 representing cardiomegaly; however, pericardial effusion cannot be completely
 excluded.  However, there is no evidence that  any pericardial effusion is
 hemodynamically significant.  Both lungs appear clear with no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
