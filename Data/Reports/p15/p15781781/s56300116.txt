                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, sob  // eval for pna      eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  There is minimal atelectasis at the right lung base.  Blunting
 of the bilateral costophrenic angles is likely secondary to a small amount of
 pleural effusion.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles is likely secondary to a small
 amount of pleural effusion.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
