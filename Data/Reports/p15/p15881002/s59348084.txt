 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multifocal regions of consolidation are present in both lungs, most severe in
 the lingula and left lower lobe and to a lesser extent within the right lower
 lobe and both upper lobes.  The upper lobe opacities appear to be superimposed

 adenocarcinoma.
 
 Moderate left and small right pleural effusions.
 
 RECOMMENDATION:
 
 DIRECT COMPARISON TO OLDER OUTSIDE RADIOGRAPHS TO DETERMINE TIME COURSE OF
