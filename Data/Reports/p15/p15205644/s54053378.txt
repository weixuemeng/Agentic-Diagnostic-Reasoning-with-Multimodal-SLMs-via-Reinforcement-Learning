 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever of unknown origin  // eval for PNA  
 eval for PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly is mild, unchanged.  There is minimal interval increase in the
 mediastinal width, potentially representing vascular enlargement.  There is
 gradual progression of multifocal opacities that might represent pulmonary
 edema but multifocal infection would be another possibility and correlation
 with chest CT would be recommended.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
 There is no pneumothorax.
