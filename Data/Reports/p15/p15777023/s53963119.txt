                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with question fever at home and acute confusion. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  Best seen on the lateral
 view is a new increased density projecting over the spine, which is not
 clearly seen on the frontal view.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  Cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but stable.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Apparent development of retrocardiac opacity only on the lateral
 view.  This could potentially represent atelectasis given slightly lower
 inspiratory effort on the current lateral film and when compared to the
 frontal view.  However, developing consolidation is not completely excluded. 
 Clinical correlation recommended.
