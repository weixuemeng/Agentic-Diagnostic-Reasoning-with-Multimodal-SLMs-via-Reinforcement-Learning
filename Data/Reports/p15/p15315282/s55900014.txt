                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fevers, cough and hypoxia.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 The lungs are low in volume with a dense retrocardiac opacity which could
 reflect left lower lobe pneumonia.  Additionally, there are bilateral pleural
 effusions and prominent interstitial markings which could reflect
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  Cardiac size is stably enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe pneumonia with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema
 and pleural effusions.
