                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right-sided PICC line with report of incorrect placement at
 outside hospital, here to evaluate PICC position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single AP upright frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a
 right PICC with the tip terminating in the upper to mid SVC.  The course of
 the line is unremarkable without evidence of pneumothorax.  The inspiratory
 lung volumes remain low.  Mild pulmonary edema has improved substantially.  No
 significant pleural effusion is identified.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal in size, but stable.  Calcification at the aortic knob is noted.  The
 mediastinum is within normal limits and unchanged from the prior study.
