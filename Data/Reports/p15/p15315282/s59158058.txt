                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with new PICC placement.  For evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest radiograph was obtained ___, timed at 9:10
 a.m.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 1:55 a.m.
 
 REPORT:
 In the interval, a PICC line has been replaced and the tip lies in the mid
 SVC.
 
 Lateral to the right hilum, and bounded sharply by the minor fissure on the
 right side, there is a developing opacity which may represent a pseudotumor. 
 There is also some minimal linear atelectatic change in the left mid zone. 
 There are poor lung volumes, although there is suggestion of a degree of
 pulmonary edema.  There is an opacity projected in the right costophrenic
 sulcus, which is of indeterminate etiology.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 Tip is unchanged in position in the mid SVC.  Probable developing pseudotumor
 in the right side.  Stable background pulmonary edema.
