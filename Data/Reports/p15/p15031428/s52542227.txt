                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ years old woman with past medical history of stroke,
 coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, and congestive heart failure
 with increased cough and shortness of breath.  Assess for pulmonary edema and
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared with chest x-ray dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view chest x-ray shows reduced lung volumes with
 increased bilateral opacities, denser to the right due to interval increase of
 pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion.  Heart size is still moderately
 enlarged with left retrocardiac double contour opacity, compatible with small
 hiatal hernia.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase of pulmonary edema radiographically, now
 moderate, with increased right lung base pleural effusion and atelectasis.
