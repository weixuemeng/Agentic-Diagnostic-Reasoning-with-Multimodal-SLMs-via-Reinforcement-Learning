                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette.  A moderate to large
 hiatal hernia is present with air-fluid level noted.  The aorta is tortuous
 and diffusely calcified.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Linear
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are moderate
 multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subsegmental bibasilar atelectasis.  Moderate to large hiatal hernia.
