                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Clinically suspected aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged, but unchanged in appearance since the prior study. 
 Mediastinum is grossly stable.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 There is minimal focal opacity at the left mid lung that might be consistent
 with atelectasis, infection is less likely.  Extensive coronary calcifications
 and stents are noted on the lateral view.
 
 There is increased density projecting over the spine involving the lower
 thoracic and upper lumbar spine.  The etiology is unclear and might represent
 artifact, thus repeated radiograph is required.
 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
