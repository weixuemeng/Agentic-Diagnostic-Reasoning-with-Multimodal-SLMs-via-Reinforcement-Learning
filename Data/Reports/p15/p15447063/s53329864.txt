                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dyspnea  // eval for acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Combination of new interstitial and ground-glass opacity in the lower lungs,
 greater pulmonary vascular distention and persistent mediastinal venous
 engorgement points to pulmonary edema, and also explains the new moderate left
 and small right pleural effusions. Lobulation to the pulmonary hila is
 presumably due to transient vascular distension, but should be re-evaluated
 after treatment of edema to exclude adenopathy.  No pneumothorax.
