                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent surgery with cough and fevers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged with coronary artery stenting again seen.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable with calcification of the aortic
 knob again noted.  There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema, worse when
 compared to the prior study.  Additionally, more focal patchy opacities are
 noted within the periphery of the right upper lung field and left mid lung
 field, which are nonspecific but may represent areas of developing infection. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, worse when compared to prior study. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.  
 
 2. Patchy ill-defined opacities within the periphery of the right upper and
 left mid lung fields.  Findings are nonspecific but may represent areas of
 developing infection.
