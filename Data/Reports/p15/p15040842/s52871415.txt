 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 4:34 PM
  Bilateral patchy consolidations, predominantly in a perihilar distribution
  with relative subpleural sparing, consistent with multifocal infection. In the
  setting of immunosuppression, atypical and fungal infections should be
  considered. Specifically, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is of concern,
  particularly in the absence of associated pleural effusions.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 3:16 PM
  Bilateral patchy parenchymal consolidations in a background of diffuse nodular
  opacities, concerning for multifocal infection. If the patient is
  immunosuppressed, atypical infections should be considered.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SAPHO syndrome on infliximab, presenting
 with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study performed on ___, there has been interval
 development of multifocal patchy consolidations, with predominant perihilar
 involvement.  Additional innumerable nodular opacities are scattered
 throughout both lungs.  Findings are concerning for multifocal infection.  In
 the setting of immunosuppression, atypical and fungal infections should be
 considered.  Notably, there is no pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Heart
 size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral patchy consolidations, predominantly in a perihilar distribution
 with relative subpleural sparing, consistent with multifocal infection.  In
 the setting of immunosuppression, atypical and fungal infections should be
 considered.  Specifically, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is of concern,
 particularly in the absence of associated pleural effusions.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Updated findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 4:15 PM, 10 minutes after attending
