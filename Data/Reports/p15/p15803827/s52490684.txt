                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with extensive pulmonary history, bronchoscopy
 yesterday presents with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT trachea ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC tip terminates in the lower SVC.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Linear scarring in the left
 apex is similar.  Diffuse bronchiectasis is re- demonstrated with areas of
 lucency compatible with regions of air trapping, more so within the right lung
 compared to the left, better appreciated on the previous CT.  Increased patchy
 opacities are noted within the left lung base, new from the previous study,
 findings which could reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded.  Chain sutures are seen within the left lower lung field.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in left lung base may reflect atelectasis, but infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.  Chronic bronchiectasis with areas of scarring
 and air trapping again noted.
