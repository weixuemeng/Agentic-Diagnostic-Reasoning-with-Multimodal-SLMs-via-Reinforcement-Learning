  New destruction of the right posterior sixth rib with vague lung opacity,
  worrisome for metastatic disease.  Equivocal increase in left suprahilar
  density at site of prior treatment, although most likely technique related.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis.  History of squamous cell carcinoma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 chest is hyperinflated.  There is similar mild volume loss in the left upper
 chest with widespread opacification and pleural thickening.  There is no
 definitive change in this area since the prior study, although the upper part
 of a left suprahilar density appears perhaps somewhat more dense.  More clear
 change is new destruction of the right posterior fifth rib with overlying
 opacity worrisome for metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New destruction of the right sixth rib with overlying opacity worrisome
 for a metastasis.
 
 2.  Equivocal increase in density of left upper lung opacity, although perhaps
 an artifact of slightly different orientation.
