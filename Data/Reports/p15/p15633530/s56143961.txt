                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest x-ray ___.
 2. FDG PET-CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 Left mid lung patchy opacities reflect known radiation fibrosis involving the
 left lower lobe.  Right hemithorax volume loss is unchanged.  Right lower lung
 opacification most conspicuous on lateral view likely reflects known right
 lower lung lesion better evaluated on prior FDG PET-CT.
 
 There is no definite superimposed focal lung consolidation.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  There is no sizable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite evidence of pneumonia.
