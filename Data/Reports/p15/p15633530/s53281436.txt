                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with
 presyncope, recent  pulmonary embolism// evaluate for pneumonitis, pulmonary
 infarct, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post right upper lobectomy with similar postsurgical changes
 the right hilum and right upper thorax.  Heart size appears mildly enlarged
 but similar.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Focal opacity within the peripheral right mid
 lung field corresponds to postradiation changes and known lesion as seen on
 the previous CT, not substantially changed from the previous radiograph. 
 Known a spiculated lesion in the right lower lobe is better assessed on the
 prior CT.  There is a persistent right subpulmonic effusion, moderate in size.
 No new focal consolidation, left-sided pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is
 apparent.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the previous radiograph.  Persistent
 moderate size right subpulmonic pleural effusion.  Left mid lung field
 opacification is also grossly unchanged, compatible with known lesion and
 associated post radiation changes.  Spiculated opacity in the right lower lobe
 is better assessed on previous CT.
