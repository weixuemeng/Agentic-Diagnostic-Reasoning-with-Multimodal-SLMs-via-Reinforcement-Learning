                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man sp right upper lobectomy  // Eval for pneumo
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there is massive
 subcutaneous emphysema.  While no pneumothorax definitively seen, the
 extensive subcutaneous emphysema might easily mask a pneumothorax, if present.
 There is extensive pneumomediastinum.  The left lung is fully expanded and
 clear.  No pleural effusions.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged without
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 While no pneumothorax is definitively seen, the new, extensive subcutaneous
 emphysema might easily mask a pneumothorax, if present.  Extensive
 pneumomediastinum is also new since the immediate postoperative portable
 radiograph. These findings raise the possibility of a significant air leak.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 9:53 AM, approximately 10
 minutes after discovery of the findings.
