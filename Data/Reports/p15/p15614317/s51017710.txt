                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for evidence of aspiration in a patient status post
 syncope and fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes which
 result in exaggeration of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and bronchovascular
 crowding.  Allowing for this, there is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.  No
 nondisplaced rib fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular crowding.  Within these limitations, no acute cardiopulmonary
 process.The lower lungs are difficult to evaluate given low lung volumes.  If
 there is continued concern, repeat radiographs with good inspiration should be
 obtained.
