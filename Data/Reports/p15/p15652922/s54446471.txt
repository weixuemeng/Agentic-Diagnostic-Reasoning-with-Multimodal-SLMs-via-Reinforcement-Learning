                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cardiac arrest, rosc, intubated.  Assess endotracheal
 tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 At the left lower corner of film there is a sharp demarcation of the soft
 tissues which is artifactual.  The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of
 vasculature.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart is top-normal in
 size, likely accentuated due to patient positioning and low lung volumes. 
 Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 An endotracheal tube is at the level of thoracic inlet 8 cm above the level of
 the carina.  An enteric feeding tube is seen coursing midline with tip out of
 field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube at the level of thoracic inlet, 8 cm above the level of
 the carina.
 2.  Enteric feeding tube tip not evaluated.
 3.  Sharp demarcation of soft tissues left lower edge of film is artifactual.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend advancing endotracheal tube 2 cm for better
 positioning.
