                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman w/ complicated diverticulitis s/p IR drainage
 of abscess, with persistent abdominal pain and high narcotic usage  // please
 perform upright CXR to r/o free air
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Frontal lateral views of the chest.  Images are not specifically
 labeled as upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, the heart is not enlarged.  Mild
 prominence of the mediastinum could reflect low inspiratory volumes.
 
 There is some patchy opacity at both lung bases.  While this could reflect
 atelectasis, the appearance is more suggestive of pneumonic infiltrates or
 areas of aspiration.
 
 No CHF, effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.
 
 No free air identified beneath the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities at both lung bases.  Question early pneumonic infiltrate or
 areas of aspiration.  Recommend follow-up chest radiograph after resolution of
 acute process to confirm resolution.
 
 No free air seen beneath the diaphragm.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend follow-up chest radiograph after resolution of
 acute process to confirm resolution of bibasilar infiltrates.
