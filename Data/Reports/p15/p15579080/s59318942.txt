                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with complex past medical history with two weeks of
 persistent nausea, vomiting, weight loss, recent pneumonia.  Assess for
 resolution of pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is
 improvement in aeration in the left lower lung with persistent linear density
 likely relating to persistent atelectasis.  No effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 The right lung is clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration in the left lower lung with persistent linear
 opacity at the site of prior pneumonia, which could represent residual
 atelectasis.
