                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female on chemotherapy, now presenting with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A right Port-A-Cath terminates in the
 right atrium, unchanged from prior.  Lung volumes are extremely low, limiting
 evaluation of the lung bases.  Increased opacity within the medial right lung
 is likely due to atelectasis.  No confluent consolidation is identified. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema is identified. There is no large
 pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with probable right basilar atelectasis.  No
 confluent consolidation.
