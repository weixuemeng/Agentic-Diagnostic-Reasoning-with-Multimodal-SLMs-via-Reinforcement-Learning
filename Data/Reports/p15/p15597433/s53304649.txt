                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Abdomen and pelvis CT from the same day and CT chest from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The left hemidiaphragm appears chronically elevated.  There are increased left
 lower lobe opacities  likely reflecting combination of worsening of known left
 lower lobe pneumonia versus radiation pneumonitis along with an adjacent
 pleural effusion.  The left upper lung and the right lung appear clear. 
 Previously noted subpleural radiation changes are better delineated on
 dedicated CT.  No acute fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased opacities at the left lung base likely reflecting combination of
 worsening infectious process along with a new adjacent pleural effusion. 
 Alternatively, these findings may be representative of radiation pneumonitis
 with an adjacent pleural effusion.
