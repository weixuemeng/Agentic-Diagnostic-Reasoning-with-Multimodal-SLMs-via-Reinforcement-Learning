                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hemoptysis s/p banding  // interval change
 after hemoptysis. Aspiration?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, a nasogastric tube has been
 removed.  Lower lung volumes accentuate the cardiomediastinal contours and
 result in crowding of bronchovascular structures at the lung bases.  Within
 this limitation, apparently new peribronchial cuffing and minimal right
 infrahilar opacity may reflect clinically suspected aspiration or a focus of
 atelectasis.
