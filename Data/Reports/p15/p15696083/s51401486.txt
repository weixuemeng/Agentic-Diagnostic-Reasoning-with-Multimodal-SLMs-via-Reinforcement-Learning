                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ruptured AAA s/p EVAR c/b HCAP  // Assess
 for interval change in pulmonary edema, consolidation      Assess for interval
 change in pulmonary edema, consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged.  The patient has taken a better inspiration.  The right
 hemidiaphragmatic contour is sharply seen.  Opacification at the left base
 with silhouetting hemidiaphragm again is consistent with pleural fluid and
 volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged.  There is a
 suggestion of some increased opacification just above the minor fissure.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent a developing
 consolidation in the right upper lobe.
