                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p AAA repair  // pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray examination from ___ at 20:28
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a right IJ sheath overlying the proximal SVC.  An NG tube is
 present the tip likely overlies the gastric fundus.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but
 unchanged sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted there is
 engorgement of the central vascular sure, upper zone redistribution, diffuse
 vascular plethora and vascular blurring, and peribronchial cuffing consistent
 with CHF and interstitial edema.
 Again seen is increased retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.  Is also patchy opacity at the right lung base
 similar to the prior film.  There is a small to moderate left-sided effusion
 pleural effusion and a small right pleural effusion.  These are essentially
 unchanged, possibly slightly larger on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 CHF with interstitial edema.  Allowing for technical differences, this is
 similar, possibly minimally more pronounced, than on the prior study.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions left-greater-than- right, with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.  The effusion on the right may be slightly larger.
