                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman status pole left upper lobe wedge resection now
 status post chest tube removal , evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP view of the chest provided.
 
 Left-sided chest tube has been removed.  Since prior study from 1 day ago, the
 left apical pneumothorax is significantly smaller. The left lingular and lower
 lobe opacity has increased, which could reflect atelectasis or early
 pneumonia.  Right lower lobe opacity still persists.  Left upper mediastinal
 opacity is stable, but still obscuring the aortic arch, and could be
 atelectasis versus hematoma.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Significantly smaller left apical pneumothorax.
 2.  Worsening left lingular and left lower lobe opacity, likely atelectasis
 versus early pneumonia.
 3.  Persistent left upper mediastinal opacity, likely atelectasis or hematoma.
