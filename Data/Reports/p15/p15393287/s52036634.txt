                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, postop day two from open sigmoid colectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  The patient is status post median sternotomy. 
 Left base opacity is seen, which may be due to atelectasis; however, a small
 pleural effusion may be present, and a developing pneumonia is not excluded. 
 There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle and a trace right
 pleural effusion is not excluded there either.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Evidence of air seen under the right
 hemidiaphragm, presumed postoperative.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity could be due to atelectasis; however,
 developing infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles, trace effusions not excluded.
 
 Evidence of pneumoperitoneum, presumed due to recent surgery.
