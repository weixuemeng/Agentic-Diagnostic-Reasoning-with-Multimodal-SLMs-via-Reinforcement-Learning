                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left chest pain 
 
 COMPARISON:  None 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are well expanded. 
 There are subtle opacities in the left upper lobe, projecting over the
 anterior 3rd rib on the PA view, that radiate out from the left hilus.  There
 is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle left upper lobe opacity of uncertain significance.  This could
 represent a small focus of sub-segmental bronchiectasis.  If symptoms persist,
 repeat chest radiographs may be performed with PA, lateral, and bilateral
 shallow oblique projections.
 
 Findings were sent to the ED QA nurses via email at ___ ___ after
