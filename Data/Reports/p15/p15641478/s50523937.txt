                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with one-week of cough productive of yellow sputum.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There is
 retrocardiac opacity, which silhouettes the hemidiaphragm.  This is compatible
 with pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.  Superiorly, the left lung is
 clear as is the right lung.  There is no effusion noting that the inferior
 most aspect of the costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for technique,
 positioning and relatively low lung volumes.  Atherosclerotic calcifications
 are noted at the arch.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are grossly
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity compatible with pneumonia in the proper
 clinical setting.  Repeat exam after treatment is suggested to document
 resolution.
