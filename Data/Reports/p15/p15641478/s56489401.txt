                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Recurrent cough and weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a patchy retrocardiac opacity which appears similar to
 perhaps slightly improved.  A patchy right mid lung opacity appears new since
 the prior study, concerning for bronchopneumonia.  Although perhaps less
 likely, a heterogeneous predominantly right-sided pattern of mild pulmonary
 congestion could be considered.  The pulmonary vascularity is mildly
 prominent.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent patchy retrocardiac opacity, similar to slightly
 improved.  New right mid lung opacity concerning for pneumonia in the
 background of slightly prominent pulmonary vascularity suggesting pulmonary
 venous hypertension.  Although probably less likely, mild asymmetric pulmonary
 congestion could also be considered.
