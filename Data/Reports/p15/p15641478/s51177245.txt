                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with cough and fever; pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT scan, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low.  There are still bibasilar atelectases with very
 mild left retrocardiac opacities that could be atelectasis, but aspiration or
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax and no
 significant pleural effusion.  The mediastinal and cardiac contours are
 unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 There is no significant change since the previous exam.  There are bibasilar
 mild atelectases.  Stable left retrocardiac opacities can be atelectasis, but
 superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
