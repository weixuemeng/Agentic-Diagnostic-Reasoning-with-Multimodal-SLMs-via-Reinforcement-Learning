                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall with continued right
 lateral rib pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  A
 dual-lead pacer is unchanged in position.  The previously noted right IJ
 central venous catheter has been removed.  The lungs are clear and well
 inflated without focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No acute fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No traumatic findings.  If strong clinical concern for rib
 fracture, a dedicated rib series may be performed to further assess.
