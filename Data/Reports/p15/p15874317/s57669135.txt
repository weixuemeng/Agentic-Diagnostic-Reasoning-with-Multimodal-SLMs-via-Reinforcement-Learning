                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with dyspnea.  Evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study dated ___.  The overall heart size is at the upper
 limit of normal variation.  No typical configurational abnormality is
 identified.  There is a relative prominence of the left ventricular contour to
 the left and posteriorly but no signs of significant left atrial enlargement
 is present.  The thoracic aorta is generally moderately widened and shows
 extensive wall calcifications predominantly in the arch, but also extending
 into the descending aorta.  On the lateral view, the typical calcifications in
 the aortic valve are identified.  A permanent pacer is located in left
 anterior axillary position that is connected to two intracavitary electrodes,
 one of which terminates towards the right atrial appendage, the second
 terminates in the apical portion of the right ventricle.  These findings are
 stable when compared with the next preceding examination when the patient had
 to be examined in sitting semi-upright position using AP frontal projection
 view.  The latter finding explains that the heart shadow appeared somewhat
 larger than it is now.  Pulmonary vasculature is not congested and there is no
 evidence of any acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates.  Lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are free and no pneumothorax is identified in the
 apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings in elderly female patient with permanent
 pacer, dual electrodes in place, borderline heart size but no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion or any acute infiltrates.  Extensive aortic wall
 calcifications and calcium deposits in the aortic valve area already seen on
 previous examinations.
