                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE FILM ___ AT 17:57
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with PICC placement.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 16:14.
 
 A single portable chest film ___ at 17:57 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the mid to distal SVC.  Lung
 volumes continue to remain low and there is a persistent predominantly linear
 opacity at the right base likely representing atelectasis.  No pulmonary
 edema.  No pleural effusions.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are likely stable and differences in positioning,
 although the ascending aorta does remain prominent raising the possibility of
 underlying hypertension.
