                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with altered MS  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to prior, there has been no significant interval change. 
 Opacity at the right lung base medially is compatible with a tortuous lower
 thoracic intra-abdominal aorta.  There is no consolidation worrisome for
 infection.  There is no edema or effusion.  Linear left basilar opacities are
 most suggestive atelectasis or scar.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable
 noting that cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess given contour or of the
 tortuous thoracic aorta.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
