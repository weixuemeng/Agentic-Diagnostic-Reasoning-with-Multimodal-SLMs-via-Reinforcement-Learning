                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and sanguineous sputum.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is an extensive new consolidation, predominantly in the left upper lobe,
 although there is also patchy opacification in the left lower lobe, all
 suggestive of pneumonia.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with pneumonia in the left lung.  Follow-up
 radiographs are recommended in order to ensure resolution and accordingly
 exclude a mass lesion.
