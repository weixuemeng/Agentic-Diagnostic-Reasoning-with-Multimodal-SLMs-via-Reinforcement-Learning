                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left pneumothorax seen on recent CT.  Now status post left
 pleural tube placement.  Evaluate for interval change in pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned, ending 5.9 cm
 above the level of the carina.  An enteric catheter ends within the
 mid-to-upper thoracic esophagus.  A new left pleural tube ends at the left
 lung apex.  Evaluation for interval change in the known left pneumothorax is
 difficult given the supine technique, although no definite pneumothorax is
 identified.  There has been interval right upper lobe collapse, likely
 secondary to mucus plugging.  Consolidative opacities in the posterior aspects
 of the right upper and bilateral lower lobes seen on CT from earlier today are
 not well appreciated on the current study.  The heart size is normal.  Left
 hemothorax is not well evaluated, thought to be pooling in the posterior
 sulcus.  Bilateral rib fractures were fully discussed on the recent CT torso.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New right upper lobe collapse, likely secondary to mucus plugging.
 
 2.  No definite left pneumothorax, although evaluation is limited by the
 supine technique.
 
 3.  Enteric catheter ends within the mid-to-upper thoracic esophagus. 
 Repositioning recommended.
