                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube placement after rib fractures, to assess for pneumothorax
 and inflation of opposite lung.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  There is no convincing evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Increased opacification at the right base could reflect some combination of
 atelectasis and aspiration.  Less prominent changes are seen at the left base.
 The possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Decreasing subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral chest wall.
