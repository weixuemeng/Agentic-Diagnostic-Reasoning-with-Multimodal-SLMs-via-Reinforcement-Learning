                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fall, rib fractures, chest tube placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The left chest tube is in place, unchanged in position with no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Left chest wall is partially imaged but impression is that the
 left basal atelectasis has slightly increased.  Right basal opacity which
 might potentially represent atelectasis as well, has slightly improved.  The
 NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Left subclavian line tip is at the junction of
 the brachiocephalic vein and SVC, most likely.
