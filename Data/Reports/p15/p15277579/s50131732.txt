                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma and
 status post partial right nephrectomy.  Study is to evaluate for a possible
 lung metastasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear. On the lateral projection one can see the
 right anterior diaphragmatic pleural contour is elevated and flattened,
 obliterating the anterior sulcus.  This could be due to a small, residual
 loculation of previously large pleural effusion, or pleural thickening.  The
 left basal pleural surface is normal.  Small areas of right costal pleural
 thickening reflect prior pleural insult.  Cardiomediastinum is within normal
 limits and stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Small residual right anterior pleural thickening or residual fluid
 loculation. Followup is warranted only if previous right pleural effusion was
 malignant or patient has referable signs or symptoms.
