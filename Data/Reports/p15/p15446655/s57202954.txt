                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___, chest CT
 ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  A right upper extremity PICC
 terminates in the low SVC.
 
 The large right upper mediastinal mass is grossly unchanged and better defined
 on the subsequent chest CT.  A moderate right pleural effusion has slightly
 increased.  No pneumothorax.  The heart size is difficult to evaluate given
 the parenchymal abnormalities, however, is unchanged from prior.  There is no
 evidence for pulmonary edema.  Atelectasis is noted at the left lung base.
