                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with CHF and AFib, now with increasing shortness
 of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs including
 ___, ___ and ___.  The study is read in
 conjunction with CTA of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrate interval
 increase in size of right pleural effusion since the prior study.  There is
 also increase in degree of peribronchial cuffing, consistent with mild
 pulmonary edema.  The heart size is difficult to evaluate due to large right
 pleural effusion, but does not appear significantly different from the prior
 study.  A large right upper mediastinal mass is unchanged, and compatible with
 thyroid mass as seen on recent prior CTA.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in right pleural effusion and mild pulmonary
 edema.  Stable right mediastinal mass.
