                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD/CHF concern for disseminated zoster  //
 evidence of infection      evidence of infection
 
 COMPARISON:  The only prior chest radiograph since ___ was on ___ of
 than a year.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes are exacerbated.  A band of atelectasis outlines a
 substantially larger hiatus hernia.
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly has increased as has pulmonary vascular
 caliber accompanied by new mild pulmonary edema due to cardiac decompensation.
 Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 It is impossible to exclude early zoster infection, but I doubt that
 widespread pneumonia is present currently
