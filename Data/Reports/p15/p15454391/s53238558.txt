                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever  // source of fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral low lung volumes.  Crowding of vessels may be exaggerated by low
 lung volumes.  Cardiac silhouette can be exaggerated by low lung volumes. 
 There is no pneumothorax.   Small left pleural effusion probable.  Consider
 repeat radiographs with improved inspiratory volumes to evaluate the right
 lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral low lung volumes with large hiatal hernia.  Cardio vasculature
 likely exaggerated by low lung volumes.  To further evaluate the right lung
 base, consider repeat radiographs with better inspiration.
