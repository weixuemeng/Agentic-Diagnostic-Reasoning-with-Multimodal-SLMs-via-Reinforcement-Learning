                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION:  A right infrahilar opacity corresponds to
 opacification seen on CT of the same date, consistent with pneumonia.  Opacity
 seen at the left base by CT is less well appreciated in the retrocardiac space
 on this exam.  No pleural effusion, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is
 present.  The heart, mediastinal and pleural surface contours are normal.
