                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG  // f/u effusions, atx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   ___ AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to ___ chest radiograph, the pulmonary vascular
 congestion, cephalization of pulmonary vessels, diffuse bilateral interstitial
 edema, and moderate size left pleural effusion have improved.  Bilateral small
 pleural effusions persist (left greater than right.).  There is interval
 worsening of the right basal atelectasis and severe persistent left basilar
 atelectasis.  Post-cardiothoracic surgery mediastinal changes are stable.  The
 tip of the right IJ terminates in the upper right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1.  Interval improvement of left moderate size pleural effusion however
 bilateral small pleural effusions persist (left greater than right).
 2. Interval worsening of right basal atelectasis and persistent severe left
 lower lung atelectasis.
 3. Stable cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion, and cephalization of
 pulmonary vessels without overt pulmonary edema.
