                                 FINAL REPORT
 INTRAOPERATIVE CHEST X-RAYS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  Missing sponge count.
 
 FINDINGS:  Multiple portable views of the chest and neck were reviewed in
 addition to additional film of the sponge from the missing counts.  Right neck
 drain is identified overlying the thoracic inlet, compatible with recent
 surgery.  There are no radiopaque densities matching the sponge of missing
 counts.  Lungs demonstrate relatively low lung volumes with secondary crowding
 of the bronchovascular markings.  Possible component of mild congestion is
 seen.  There is prominence of mediastinal soft tissues, potentially related to
 recent surgery and in part due to positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No evidence of radiopaque foreign body matching the sponge of the abnormal
 counts.  
 
 Findings were discussed with the surgical attending, Dr. ___ at the time of
 interpretation at 1:40 p.m. on ___.
