                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Bradycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Streaky left basilar opacity
 suggests minor atelectasis.  Blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus may
 reflect a tiny effusion.  Bones appear demineralized.  Right-sided rib
 deformities appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving basilar opacities without definite evidence for acute
 disease.
