                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Unwitnessed fall, question intracranial hemorrhage.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  A
 ventriculoperitoneal catheter courses along the right hemithorax.  Lung
 volumes are low.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Opacity at the left base corresponds to a prominent epicardial
 fat pad see on the recent CT torso. Linear opacity in the left lower lung is
 consistent with atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 Median sternotomy wires are intact. The known displaced left distal clavicle
 fracture is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes but no acute process.
