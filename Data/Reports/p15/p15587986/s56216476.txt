                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PNA, hx of asthma, smoking s/p b/l groin
 cutdown and thromboembolectomy  // evaluate resolving PNA, atelectasis    
 evaluate resolving PNA, atelectasis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is mild
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Continued increased opacification at
 the bases, especially on the right above the elevated hemidiaphragm, are
 consistent with pleural fluid and atelectatic change.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia,
 especially in the absence of a lateral view.
