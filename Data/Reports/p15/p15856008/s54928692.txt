                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Single lead
 left-sided AICD is again seen.  Patient is status post median sternotomy.  The
 patient is rotated to the right.  There is blunting of bilateral costophrenic
 angles, left greater than right, consistent with moderate left and small right
 pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  Evaluation of the left mid to
 lower lung fields is partially obscured by overlying battery pack.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  There is moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large cardiac silhouette, pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural
 effusions suggests CHF which appears worse as compared to the prior study,
 given differences in inspiration/technique.
