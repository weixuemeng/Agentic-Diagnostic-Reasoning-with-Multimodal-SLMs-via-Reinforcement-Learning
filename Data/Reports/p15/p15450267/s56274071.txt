                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with plain films equivocal for left hip fracture. 
 Patient on Coumadin for mechanical valve.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  A single-lead pacemaker/ICD
 device has a lead terminating in the right ventricle.  The box is situated
 along the right upper chest wall.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  There is vague suggestion of a
 possible air-fluid level projecting over the lower central mediastinum so
 potentially there is a substantial hiatal hernia although uncertain.  The
 pulmonary interstitium is slightly prominent, suggesting a component of
 pulmonary venous hypertension or slight fluid overload including thickening of
 the minor fissure.  A very small pleural effusion is suspected, at least on
 the right side.  In addition there are patchy basilar opacities that in the
 clinical context and with low lung volumes, likely reflect minor atelectasis. 
 The bones appear demineralized.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting slight fluid overload or pulmonary venous
 hypertension including cardiomegaly and a small suspected right-sided pleural
 effusion which is suspected.  Patchy opacities most suggestive of minor
 atelectasis.  Findings which may suggest a hiatal hernia.
