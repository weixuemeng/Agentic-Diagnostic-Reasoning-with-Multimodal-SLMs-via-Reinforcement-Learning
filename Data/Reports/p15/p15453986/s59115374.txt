                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with left chest pain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 There is no pleural effusion, but there could be a tiny left apical
 pneumothorax.  If that is clinically pertinent, I would recommend an
 expiration frontal view of the chest.  Lungs are clear.  Heart size is normal
 and there is no evidence of central lymph node enlargement.  Chest cage is
 normal, but conventional chest radiographs are not designed for detection of
 subtle chest cage abnormalities.  If there are focal findings, detailed views
 of the ribs should be obtained.  The findings were posted to the online record
 of critical radiology findings for direct notification of the referring
 physician, at the time of this dictation.
