                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ F s/p lap chole ___ w/ free air and fluid on CT scan
 concerning for perforated viscous s/p exploratory laparoscopy -> laparotomy,
 now with increase sputum production.  // Pl rule out pneumonia
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  There no prior chest radiographs. This study is compared with a
 preoperative torso CT shadowing cleared chest.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacification in the lower lungs is probably a combination of moderate pleural
 effusion and substantial bibasilar atelectasis. In that setting common
 pneumonia is difficult to exclude comp particularly in the left lower lobe. I
 would recommend evaluation with at least conventional chest radiographs,
 particularly a lateral view, and if that imaging is equivocal, follow with CT
 scanning. The upper lungs are clear. The heart is normal size there is no
 pneumothorax.
