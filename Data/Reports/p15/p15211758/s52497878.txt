 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Left chest wall pacer device is again
 seen with leads extending to the region the right atrium and right ventricle
 as on prior.  Midline sternotomy wires are again noted.  There is subtle lower

 edema.  No large effusions are seen.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  Bony structures appear intact.
