                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Wheezing in patient after recent CABG and aortic
 valve replacement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The pacemaker leads terminating above the expected location of the right
 ventricle are unchanged in appearance.  Mediastinum is stable. 
 Post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable.  There is interval improvement of left
 lung aeration with no new consolidation to suggest infectious process.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal amount of pleural effusion cannot
 be excluded at the left lung base versus pleural thickening.
