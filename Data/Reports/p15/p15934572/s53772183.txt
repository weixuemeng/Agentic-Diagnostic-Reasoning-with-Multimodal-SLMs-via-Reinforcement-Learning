                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for
 leftward patient rotation.  Low lung volumes result in crowding of
 bronchovascular structures.  Patchy right lower lobe and combined patchy and
 linear left lower lobe opacities are present, and most likely represent
 atelectasis.  Aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia are also possible
 in the appropriate clinical setting, a short-term followup radiographs may be
 helpful in this regard if warranted clinically.
