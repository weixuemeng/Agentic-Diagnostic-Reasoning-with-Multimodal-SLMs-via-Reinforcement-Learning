                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain, hypoxia and elevated lipase.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy and probably coronary artery
 bypass graft surgery.  A PICC line has been removed.  The heart is mild to
 moderately enlarged, as before.  There is new perihilar fullness and
 indistinct prominent interstitial markings, suggesting mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema.  In addition, new opacities have developed in the medial lung
 bases, probably greater on the right than the left, which are highly
 nonspecific.  In the setting of an inflammatory process in the abdomen,
 atelectasis could be considered or possibly pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema.  Nonspecific basilar opacities.  If there is
 clinical concern for pneumonia, then short-term followup radiographs may be
 helpful, preferably with PA and lateral technique, if feasible.
