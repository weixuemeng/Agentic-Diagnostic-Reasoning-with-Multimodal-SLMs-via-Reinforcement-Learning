                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with acute cholecystitis, status post ERCP with
 shortness of breath, assess for pulmonary edema and pleural effusion.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable.  Aereation of the left lower lobe
 has improved.  Right lower lobe opacities have minimally improved.  This could
 be due to atelectasis and/or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 If any, there is a small right effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is
 mild vascular congestion.
