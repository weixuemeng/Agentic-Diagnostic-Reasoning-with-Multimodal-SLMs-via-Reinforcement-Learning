 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Low O2 saturation.
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is moderate pulmonary edema.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side, are consistent
 with atelectasis.  There is probably a small effusion on the left.
