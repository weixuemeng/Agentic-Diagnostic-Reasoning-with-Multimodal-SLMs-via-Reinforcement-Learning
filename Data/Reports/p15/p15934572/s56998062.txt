                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and increased oxygen requirement in a patient presenting
 with acute coronary syndrome.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  There is moderate alveolar
 pulmonary edema as well as stable moderate cardiomegaly.  Small pleural
 effusions are possible.  Underlying pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Sternotomy cerclage wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Pulmonary edema likely secondary to decompensated congestive heart
 failure.
 2.  Underlying pneumonia in the lung bases would be masked by the edema.  If
 there is concern for infection, consider reimaging after diuresis.
