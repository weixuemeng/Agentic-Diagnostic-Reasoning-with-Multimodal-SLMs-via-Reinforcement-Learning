                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant pain and hypoxia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen from the same day.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of chest demonstrate extremely low lung volumes which
 contribute to bibasilar atelectasis.  Given these low lung volumes, evaluation
 for an infectious process is very limited.  There is no pneumothorax.  There
 is no pleural effusion.  The heart size is exaggerated given AP view as well
 as low lung volumes.  No free air is noted in the abdomen.  A percutaneous
 biliary drain is seen in the right upper quadrant.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited study due to the extremely low lung volumes demonstrating bibasilar
 and subsegmental atelectasis without convincing evidence of pneumonia, but
 this evaluation is limited.
