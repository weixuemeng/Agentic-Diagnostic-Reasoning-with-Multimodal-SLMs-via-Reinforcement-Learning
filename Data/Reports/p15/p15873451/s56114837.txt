                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with poor oxygen saturation after fluids. 
 Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild pulmonary congestion on a background of interstitial lung disease appears
 similar to the prior chest radiograph performed 6 hours prior. There are small
 pleural effusions.  The lung volumes are low each may accentuate the probably
 enlarged heart.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  Airspace opacity at the
 left lung base likely reflects interstitial lung disease although infection
 cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
