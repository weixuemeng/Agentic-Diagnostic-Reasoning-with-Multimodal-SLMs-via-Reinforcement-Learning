                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever with upper abdominal pain, assess source.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  Minimal density at
 the left lung base is more compatible with atelectasis.  No convincing signs
 of pneumonia.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.  The aorta is
 unfolded.  The heart size appears normal.  No pneumothorax.  No signs of
 pulmonary edema.  Bony structures appear intact.  A vascular stent is
 partially visualized in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild left basal atelectasis.  No convincing signs of pneumonia.
