                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old marrow it has pain and nausea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal opacity is
 identified within the bilateral lungs.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy.  Several radiopaque surgical clips are identified within the
 middle mediastinum.  The abdominal aorta is unfolded, similar in appearance
 when compared to prior examination dated ___.  Allowing for
 differences in patient positioning, the overall mediastinal and hilar contours
 when compared to radiograph dated ___ is unchanged. Prominence of
 the right mediastinum along the right paratracheal stripe may represent
 vascular ectasia.  Pulmonary vessels are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a partially visualized vascular stent in
 the upper abdomen.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No convincing signs of pneumonia.  Allowing for differences in patient
 positioning, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable in appearance compared
 to prior examinations dated ___. Prominence of right mediastinum
 along the right paratracheal stripe may represent vascular ectasia. This can
 be formally evaluated by non emergent chest CT.
