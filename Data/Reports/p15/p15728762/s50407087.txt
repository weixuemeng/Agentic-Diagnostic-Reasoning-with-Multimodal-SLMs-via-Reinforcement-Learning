                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough and post prandial epigastric pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Mediastinal contour is
 unchanged with marked tortuosity of the aorta.  Focal convexity of the right
 superior mediastinal border is compatible with prominent vasculature as seen
 on the previous CT.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Streaky opacities
 within the retrocardiac region likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Partially imaged is an aortic
 stent within the upper abdomen.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal streaky retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis.
