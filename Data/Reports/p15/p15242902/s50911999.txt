                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with oxygen desaturation pneumonia on
 outside hospital x-ray status post positive pressure ventilation in OR. 
 Evaluate for progression of parenchymal findings.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 8:34.
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The heart remains markedly enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly,
 although pericardial effusion could also have this appearance.  There has been
 interval improvement in the pulmonary vasculature suggesting resolved mild
 interstitial edema.  Persistent opacity in the retrocardiac region may reflect
 a combination of a small effusion and lower lobe atelectasis, although
 pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded.  A dual-lead left-sided
 pacer remains in place and is unchanged in appearance.  No pneumothorax is
 appreciated.  Right posterolateral sixth rib fracture again appreciated and
 appears minimally displaced.
