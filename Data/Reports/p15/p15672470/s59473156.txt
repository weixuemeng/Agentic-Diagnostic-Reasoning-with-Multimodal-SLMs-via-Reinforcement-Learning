                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Lungs are clear except for minimal left retrocardiac opacity,
 possibly due to localized scarring in this patient with previous left lower
 lobe pneumonias.  Appearance is currently similar to a post-treatment of ___, and improved since ___ radiograph.  Remainder of lungs are
 clear, and there are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 Splenomegaly is noted in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Nonspecific left retrocardiac opacity, possibly due to localized scarring
 from previous pneumonias, but short-term followup radiograph may be helpful to
 exclude a recurrent active infection in this region.
 2.  Splenomegaly, in keeping with history of CLL.
