                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with chronic lymphatic leukemia,
 evaluate for pneumonia, patient has crackles in the left base.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  The heart size is at the upper limit of normal variation.  No
 typical configurational abnormalities identified.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is not congested.  There is now left-sided basal pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrate obliterating the diaphragmatic contour and that of the lower
 descending thoracic aorta.  Mild degree of blunting of the left lateral and
 posterior pleural sinus is also present. No other new pulmonary abnormalities
 are seen.  When comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral
 chest examination of ___, this pneumonic infiltrate is new.  The
 finding apparently matches the clinical findings.  Followup examination after
 treatment is recommended.
