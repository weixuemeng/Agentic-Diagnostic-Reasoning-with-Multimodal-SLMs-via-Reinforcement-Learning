                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CT, both dated ___ as well as a CT of
 the neck from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, neck pain and sore throat, findings concerning for
 pneumonia on CT of the neck.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is airspace
 consolidation in the right lower lobe, similar to that seen on prior CT. 
 Given that this consolidation has not resolved and actually appears slightly
 increased comparing chest radiographs, possibility of recurrent pneumonia
 versus malignancy should be considered.  Trace fluid along the fissural
 surfaces are noted.  The left lung appears essentially clear.  Heart and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Airspace consolidation in the right lower lobe appears slightly
 increased from the prior radiograph from ___.  Given that this
 consolidation is progressive over time and nonresolving (please correlate for
 interval treatment), a dedicated chest CT recommended to further assess.
