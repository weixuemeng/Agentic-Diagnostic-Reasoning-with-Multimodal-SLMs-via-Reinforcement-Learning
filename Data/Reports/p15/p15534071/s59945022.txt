                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left-sided rib pain after a fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There is minimal left basilar
 atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear, without a consolidation,
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is minimal left
 apical scarring.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 Evaluation of the left ribs is somewhat limited by the overlying soft tissue. 
 Within the limitations, no definite fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left basilar atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 2.  Limited evaluation of the ribs, though no definite fracture is identified.
 If indicated, could obtain dedicated rib radiographs with a BB marker at the
 site of pain.
