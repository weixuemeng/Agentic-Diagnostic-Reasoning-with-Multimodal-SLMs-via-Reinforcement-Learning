                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___ as well as a
 chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Febrile, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided. 
 Fragmented midline sternotomy wires are again seen as well as abandoned pacer
 leads in the right chest wall.  A left PICC line is seen with its tip in the
 region of the SVC.  As compared with the CT of the chest from two days ago,
 there does appear to be interval development of pulmonary edema.  The patient
 is known to have multiple peripheral nodular opacities compatible with septic
 emboli.  The heart remains moderately enlarged.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are again noted.  Bony structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of pulmonary edema.  Other findings of
 peripheral opacities previously described as septic emboli and bilateral small
 pleural effusions are unchanged.
