                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tricuspid valve endocarditis and pulmonary septic emboli. 
 Evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left internal jugular central line ends in the upper SVC.  A
 fracture of the most superior sternal wire is unchanged.  The other sternal
 wires are intact.  A sharp interface projecting over the lateral right lung is
 likely a skinfold, but a repeat chest radiograph carefully positioned should
 be able to exclude pneumothorax. The moderate right pleural effusion is
 smaller. Moderate pulmonary edema has slightly improved.  Septic
 emboli--___ peripheral nodules, some cavitary--___ stable.  No new
 nodules or consolidations are present.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 mildly enlarged and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Probable right apical skinfold.  Recommend repeat chest radiograph to
 exclude pneumothorax.
 2.  Improved, moderate right pleural effusion and pulmonary edema.
 3.  Stable septic emboli.
 
 Results were telephoned to Dr. ___ at 10 am on ___ by Dr. ___.
