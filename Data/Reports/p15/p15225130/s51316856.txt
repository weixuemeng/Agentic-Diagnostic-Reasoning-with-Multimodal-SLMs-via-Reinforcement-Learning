                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with L hip hematoma, with picc line  // position
 of picc Surg: ___ (L hip hematoma debridement)
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left subclavian PICC line, with tip overlying the upper right atrium, near
 SVC/RA junction.  Please see wet reading below.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  Aorta slightly unfolded.  Mild prominence of the
 superior mediastinum is likely accentuated by supine AP technique.  There is
 slight upper zone redistribution, also likely accentuated by technique.  No
 CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is detected.  No supine film evidence of
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Metal overlying the right shoulder appears to represent some form of shoulder
 arthroplasty.  There is increased lucency about the proximal humeral
 component, not fully evaluated on this exam.  Findings in left shoulder
 suggest glenohumeral arthritis, chronic rotator cuff tear, and soft tissue
 anchor which could reflect prior rotator cuff repair.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. PICC line overlying upper right atrium.  Please see wet reading regarding
 positioning.
 2. No supine film evidence of pneumothorax identified.
 3. No acute pulmonary process detected.
 4. Apparently status post right shoulder arthroplasty.  Question increased
 lucency about the humeral component.  Clinical correlation requested.
