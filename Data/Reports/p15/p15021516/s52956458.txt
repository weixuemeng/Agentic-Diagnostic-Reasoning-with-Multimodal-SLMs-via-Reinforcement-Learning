                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dizziness, fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is present with a left ventricular predominance. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with mild atherosclerotic
 calcifications seen in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Increased interstitial opacities are
 noted diffusely with reticulation and honeycombing at the lung bases, findings
 compatible with a chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease, not
 substantially changed in the interval.  No new focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic interstitial lung disease with fibrosis, not substantially changed in
 the interval.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
