                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of metastatic prostate
 cancer, admitted with urinary tract infection, spiked temperature during
 second unit of blood this morning now acutely wheezing, evaluate for pulmonary
 infiltrate versus edema versus TRALI.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in sitting
 semi-upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Heart size has not changed since probably
 moderately enlarged.  Thoracic aorta as before generally widened but without
 local contour abnormalities.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested
 presently, but there is a left-sided pleural effusion that obliterates the
 diaphragmatic contour and blunts of left lateral pleural sinus.  Comparison
 suggests that the pleural effusion has increased in size.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax and no new gross pulmonary abnormality can be
 identified.  In comparison with the previous study for pulmonary vascular
 pattern that contains perivascular haze , this  has now normalized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of pulmonary vascular congestion, increasing
 left-sided pleural effusion, no evidence of new pulmonary infiltrates.
