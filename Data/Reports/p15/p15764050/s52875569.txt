                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with non-small cell lung cancer with cough and
 shortness of breath.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There are lower lung volumes with worsening opacities in the lower lobes due
 to atelectasis.   There is also worsening in right perihilar and right upper
 lobe opacities.  This could be due to worsening pneumonia and/or lymphangitic
 spread.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right side, have
 increased on the right side.  Cardiac size is obscured by pleuroparenchymal
 abnormalities.  Left upper lobe opacities, likely pneumonia, are unchanged
 from prior study.  There is no pneumothorax.
