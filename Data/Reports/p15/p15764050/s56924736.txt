                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with weakness and history of lung cancer. 
 Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a diffuse opacity occupying nearly the totality of the
 right lung with some sparing of the right apex which appears mildly increased
 compared with prior CT.  In the left lung, there is a new ill-defined opacity
 in the left upper lung field. Prominence of the left hilum represents known
 hilar lymphadenopathy.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  The
 heart size is normal, and a superior vena cava stent is noted.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased opacity in the right lung is consistent with worsening
 lymphangitic carcinomatosis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.
 2.  New ill-defined opacity in the left upper lung might represent a new
 neoplastic focus versus infection.
