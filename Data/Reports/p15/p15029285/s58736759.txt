 INDICATION:  History: ___M with upper gastrointestinal bleed status post NG
 tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach, with tip off the inferior border

 atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta are noted. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are present along with patchy opacities in the lung bases,
 potentially atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Nasogastric tube in standard position within the stomach.
 2. Low lung volumes with continued patchy opacities the lung bases,
 potentially atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, not changed in the interval.
