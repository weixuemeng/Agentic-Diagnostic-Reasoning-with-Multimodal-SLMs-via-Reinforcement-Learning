 effusion is decreasing. There is no pneumothorax.  Widespread interstitial
 abnormality in the right lung and greater consolidation in the left, are
 stable or slightly decreased.  Heart size is slightly larger, suggesting
 either increased intravascular volume or a decrease in positive pressure
 ventilator support.  Tip of the endotracheal tube is less than 5 cm from the
