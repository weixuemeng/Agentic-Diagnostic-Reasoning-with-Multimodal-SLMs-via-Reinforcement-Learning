                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  STEMI, status postextubation with respiratory failure, now re-
 intubated with severe hypertension. Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright AP radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube is in satisfactory position 5 cm from carina. Right internal jugular
 central venous catheter is again in the right atrium. Enteric tube has been
 removed resulting in mild overinflation of the stomach.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis. Bilateral hazy opacities with basilar predominance have
 progressed particularly at the left base. Heart size is top-normal. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no large pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate pulmonary edema and has minimally progressed
 2. Progression of opacity at the left base may reflect underlying pneumonia.
