 previous consolidation in the left lower lobe has been severe enough at times
 to be read as pneumonia. Heart is not enlarged and mediastinal veins are not
 dilated. Right internal jugular catheter ends in the right atrium. ET tube tip
 in standard placement. Transesophageal drainage tube passes into anondistended
 stomach and out of view.
