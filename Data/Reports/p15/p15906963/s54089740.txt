                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ARDS after cardiac arrest. Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right internal jugular and inferior approach transvenous pacing wires and
 Swan-Ganz catheter are unchanged in position.  The endotracheal tube and
 enteric tubes are stable.  There has been interval removal of the intra-aortic
 balloon pump.  Heart size and mediastinal contours are stable, as are
 bilateral parenchymal opacities with apical sparing.  Increasing opacity at
 and above the minor fissure represents atelectasis in the right upper lobe.
 Small right lateral pleural effusion has essentially resolved. No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal change in bilateral parenchymal opacities, with interval removal of
 intra-aortic balloon pump.
