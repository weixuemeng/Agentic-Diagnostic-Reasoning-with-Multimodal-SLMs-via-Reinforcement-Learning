                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post CABG.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable.  Widened mediastinum has improved. 
 Pulmonary congestion has almost completely resolved.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions are small associated with adjacent opacities, right greater than
 left, consistent with atelectases that have improved from prior study on the
 left and only minimally improved on the right.  Continued followup is
 recommended.  There is no pneumothorax.  Sternal wires are aligned.
