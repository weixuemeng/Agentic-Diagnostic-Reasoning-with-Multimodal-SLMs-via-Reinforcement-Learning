                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with rib fractures (L vs R?)  // eval for ptx/hemothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   A right pleural effusion is
 better assessed on same-day CT chest on which exam it appeared simple.  Right
 rib deformities are better assessed on outside hospital CT involving the right
 upper posterior rib arches.  No definite left-sided rib fractures are seen. 
 Streaky perihilar opacities may reflect bronchovascular crowding.  A component
 of pulmonary contusion is difficult to exclude on the right.  No pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
