  1.  Interval placement of right-sided chest tube in appropriate position with
  new small anterior right pneumothorax and right-sided subcutaneous emphysema.
  2. Vascular crowding and mild vascular congestion.
  3.  Increasing left lower lobe heterogeneous opacity likely represents
  pulmonary contusion however differential includes superimposed infection and
  aspiration.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest tube placed.  Assess chest tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Outside hospital CT chest from
 earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of right-sided chest tube which is in appropriate position
 with new small anterior right pneumothorax and right-sided subcutaneous
 emphysema.  Bilateral perihilar opacities likely represent a combination of
 vascular crowding and vascular congestion.  Interval increase in heterogeneous
 opacity within the left lower lobe is most consistent with a pulmonary
 contusion however differential includes superimposed infection and aspiration.
 No large pleural effusion.
 
 Again seen are multiple right-sided rib deformities better assessed on outside
 hospital CT involving the right upper posterior ribs.  No definite left-sided
 rib fracture seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval placement of right-sided chest tube in appropriate position with
 new small anterior right pneumothorax and right-sided subcutaneous emphysema.
 2.  Vascular crowding and mild vascular congestion.
 3.  Increasing left lower lobe heterogeneous opacity likely represents
 pulmonary contusion however differential includes superimposed infection and
 aspiration.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
