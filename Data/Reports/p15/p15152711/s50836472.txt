                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient with right rib
 fractures status post chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates low lung volumes with
 increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. 
 Vascular congestion is mildly improved. A right chest tube is unchanged in
 position, allowing for differences in patient positioning.  There has been
 interval improvement of a right anterior pneumothorax.  Left base opacity is
 unchanged, likely representing pulmonary contusion, although superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.  Subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall
 is slightly increased.  Prominence of the left hilum, which appears to be
 merely vessels on recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement of a right anterior pneumothorax, although right chest
 wall subcutaneous emphysema is increased.
 2. Unchanged left base opacity, again likely representing pulmonary contusion,
 although superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
