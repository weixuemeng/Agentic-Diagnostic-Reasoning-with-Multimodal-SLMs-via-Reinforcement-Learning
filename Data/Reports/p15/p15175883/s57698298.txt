                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with EGD gastric cautery 24 hr prior. Now with chest
 pain. Assess for pneumomediastinum or free air under diaphragm.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates hypoinflated lungs with
 crowding of vasculature and bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. No pneumomediastinum. Subtle blunting of the left
 cardiophrenic angle is most consistent with scarring.
 
 Prosthetic valves are noted, most likely mitral and aortic.   Intact median
 sternotomy wires. A mildly calcified, tortuous aorta is present. The heart is
 mildly enlarged.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. No pneumomediastinum or pneumoperitoneum.
