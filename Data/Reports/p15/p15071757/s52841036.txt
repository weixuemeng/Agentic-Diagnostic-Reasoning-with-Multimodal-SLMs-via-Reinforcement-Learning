                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with new L IJ  // eval L IJ
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from earlier the same day at 16:45.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to prior, there has been interval placement of a left-sided
 central venous catheter. Tip is in the region of the RA SVC junction.
 Otherwise, there has been no change. There is no pneumothorax. Dense right
 basilar opacitiy is likely due to combination of consolidation, atelectasis
 and effusion. Left basilar opacity is less extensive, likely due to similar
 process. There is prominence of the upper mediastinum particularly on the
 right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. New left IJ central venous catheter, no pneumothorax.
 2. Dense bibasilar right greater than left consolidations silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragms likely due to combination of effusion, atelectasis and possible
 infection.
 3. Increased opacity adjacent to the upper mediastinum on the right may be in
 part due to tortuosity of the vessels however followup after treatment is
 suggested to exclude underlying lesion.
