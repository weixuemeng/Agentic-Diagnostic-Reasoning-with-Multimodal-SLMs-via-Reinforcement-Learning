                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ F w leukocytosis and cough  // PNA? pulm edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top-normal. New enlargement of the hila is noted.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are present. There is no pneumothorax. Diffuse
 increased interstitial markings is present, with a new increased opacity at
 the right lung base. Left lower lobe consolidation is also present, likely
 largely due to atelectasis. Again noted is a round structure with rim
 calcification projecting over the left lung apex, which may be located in the
 lung parenchyma or in the neck.  Lack of additional vascular calcifications
 argues against a calcified aneurysm. Degenerative changes are present in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New focal opacity at the right lung base, concerning for pneumonia in the
 correct clinical setting.
 2.  Concurrent mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
 3.  Redemonstration of small left apical rim calcified lesion, benign in
 etiology.
