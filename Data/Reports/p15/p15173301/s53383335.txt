 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recent pneumonia presenting with tachycardia
 and seizure.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  On the current exam, the lungs appear

 identified.  There is no effusion or new consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormality detected.

 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Regions of ground-glass opacities
 on recent chest CT are not clearly delineated on the current exam, potentially
 in part due to decreased sensitivity of chest x-ray.  No new consolidation
 identified.
