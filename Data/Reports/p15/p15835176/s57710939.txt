                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxic respiratory distress, assess interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  No previous films on PACS record for
 comparison.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 15 mm above the carina, slightly low.
 An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film.  A right IJ
 central line is present, tip overlying distal SVC.  
 
 There is moderate to moderately severe cardiomegaly, with a prominent left
 hilum.  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, with
 alveolar opacity, consistent with CHF and pulmonary edema.  Suspect bilateral
 effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  CHF with pulmonary edema and suspected bilateral effusions with underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation at both bases.
 
 2.  ET tube approximately 15 mm above the carina.  Clinical correlation
 regarding retraction by approximately 5 mm is requested.
