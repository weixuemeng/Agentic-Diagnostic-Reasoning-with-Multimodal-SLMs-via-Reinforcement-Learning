                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SDH, stroke, PNA, intubated  // serial exam
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16:02
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 The ET tube tip lies approximately 5.3 cm above the carina.  An NG tube tip
 overlies expected site of the gastric fundus.  The sideport lies in the region
 of the GE junction, not definitely beyond it.  Right IJ central line tip
 overlies the proximal/ mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, without overt CHF.  There is retrocardiac opacity, consistent
 with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and probably a small left
 pleural effusion.  There is minimal atelectasis at the right base with minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt significant change compared with ___ at 06:00.
