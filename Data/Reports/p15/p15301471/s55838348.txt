                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubated  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube is slightly high-riding, terminating in the thoracic
 inlet.  Advancement by about 2 cm is suggested for more optimal ventilation. 
 A right subclavian central venous catheter terminates at the superior
 cavoatrial junction.  A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  New left perihilar airspace and interstitial opacities may
 be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema, aspiration or infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Increased obscuration of the medial left
 hemidiaphragm may also be due to atelectasis, aspiration or infection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New left perihilar airspace and interstitial opacities may be due to
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, aspiration or infection in the appropriate
 clinical context.
 
 Slightly high-riding ET tube may be advanced by 2 cm for more optimal
 ventilation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The covering clinician could not be contacted by telephone,
