                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new intubation  // tube positioning
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the recent radiograph from 1 day earlier, endotracheal tube has
 been placed, terminating 4 cm above the carina.  New complete opacification of
 the left hemi thorax is consistent with left lung collapse from acute mucous
 plugging superimposed on pre-existing consolidation and pleural effusion. 
 Exam is otherwise unchanged.
