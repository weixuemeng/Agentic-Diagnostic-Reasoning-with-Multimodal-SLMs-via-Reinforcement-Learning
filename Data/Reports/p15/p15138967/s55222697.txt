                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Minimal streaky opacity in the retrocardiac
 region may reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be
 completely excluded.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.  Punctate radiopaque density projecting over the midline upper
 chest is likely external to the patient and not seen on the lateral view. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal retrocardiac streaky opacity which could reflect atelectasis, but
 aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.
