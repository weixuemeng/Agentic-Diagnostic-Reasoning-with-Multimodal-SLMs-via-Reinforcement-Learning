 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate a dual-lead
 pacemaker projecting over the left chest wall with leads extending to the
 region of the right atrium and right ventricle.  The lungs appear clear
 without signs of pneumonia or CHF.  A hyperdense nodular structure overlying
 the left lower lung could represent a calcified granuloma.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.  There is no free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings.
