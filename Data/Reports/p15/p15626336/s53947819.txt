                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___ AT 12:26
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right PICC line, wire removed, unable
 to thread.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 23:00.
 
 The upright and lateral views of the chest are submitted dated ___ at
 12:26.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right PICC line is seen to the level of the mid subclavian vein but then
 curves and heads back out peripherally with its tip in the proximal subclavian
 vein.  Repositioning would be advised.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely stable.  There is rightward deviation of the trachea which
 is chronic and may reflect a thyroid goiter.  Streaky patchy bibasilar
 opacities most likely reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  No pulmonary
 edema.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles may represent small
 effusions versus chronic pleural thickening.  Results of this examination were
 conveyed to ___ of the IV service on ___ at 1:03 p.m.
