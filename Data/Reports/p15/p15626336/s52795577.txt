                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  A small, layering left
 pleural effusion is new.  Lungs are grossly clear; a healed fracture of a
 proximal right lower rib should not be mistaken for a lung nodule.  There is
 no pneumothorax. Rightward deviation of the cervical trachea is chronic due to
 a Zenkers diverticulum of the upper esophageal sphincter or a goiter.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New small left pleural effusion, but no definite pneumonia. Consider acute
 pulmonary embolus or left upper abdomina pathology.
 
 Chronic probable Zenkers diverticulum or left thyroid lesion.
