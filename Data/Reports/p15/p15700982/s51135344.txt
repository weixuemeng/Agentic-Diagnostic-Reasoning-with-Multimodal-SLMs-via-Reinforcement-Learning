                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with recent pneumonia, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single semi-erect portable chest radiograph demonstrates
 decreased lung volumes from ___.  The lungs are clear without evidence of
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Increased
 opacification at the lung bases without obscuration of the diaphragm or heart
 borders is consistent with atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. 
 The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable from the preceding study allowing for differences in
 technique.  The thoracic aorta is mildly unfolded with calcification at the
 aortic knob.
  
 IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
