                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, difficulty breathing, please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs most
 recently performed three hours earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  On a background of minimal chronic congestive heart failure and low
 lung volumes bibasilar opacifications again noted, left greater than right
 with increased opacification noted in the posterior costophrenic angle on the
 lateral view concerning for infectious process.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Minimal rightward deviation of trachea may be due to goiter. 
 Please correlate clinically.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased retrocardiac opacification likely represents developing
 left lower lung infectious process.
