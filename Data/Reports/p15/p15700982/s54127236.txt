                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Question pneumonia or widened mediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal,
 hilar and cardiac contours.  Stable right basilar atelectasis.  Minimally
 increased retrocardiac opacity likely represent atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimally increased retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis
 exagerrated by low lung volumes.
