                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever on Remicade.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.
 Consolidative opacity in the right upper lobe medially is concerning for
 pneumonia.  Streaky and linear opacities in the lung bases bilaterally likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 posteriorly on the lateral view suggests a trace pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lobe pneumonia.  Possible trace right pleural effusion and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow up radiographs after treatment are recommended to
 ensure resolution of this finding.
