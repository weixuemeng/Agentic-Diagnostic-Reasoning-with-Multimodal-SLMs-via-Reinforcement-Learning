                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall  // pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aortic knob is calcified.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Low lung volumes are present with patchy
 opacities demonstrated in the lung bases, likely atelectasis.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema is present.  There is
 no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.  Marked
 gaseous distension of bowel loops within the upper abdomen are noted.  Remote
 fracture of the right seventh posterolateral rib is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  Please note that aspiration or infection cannot be completely
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
 2.  Marked gaseous distention of bowel loops within the upper abdomen.
