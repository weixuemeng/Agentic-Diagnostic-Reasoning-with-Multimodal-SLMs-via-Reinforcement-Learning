 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of nasogastric tube terminating in the stomach. 
 Standard position of endotracheal tube.  Stable cardiomediastinal contours,
 with a slight progression of pulmonary edema, now moderate in severity. 
 Worsening retrocardiac opacities probably represent atelectasis.  Bilateral
 layering pleural effusions are present, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
