                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent fall  // Evaluate for rib fractures,
 infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lateral view is suboptimal due to the patient's overlying arm.Given this,
 there are slight low lung volumes.  Left base opacity on the frontal view, not
 substantiated on the lateral view, most likely represents atelectasis or
 scarring.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly
 enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  No displaced fracture identified. 
 Degenerative changes are seen along the spine and at the glenohumeral and
 acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and suboptimal lateral view due to patient's overlying arm. 
 Left base opacity seen on the frontal view, not substantiated on the lateral
 view may be due to atelectasis/scarring.  No displaced fracture seen.
