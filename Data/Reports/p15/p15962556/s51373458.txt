 Cardiac size cannot be evaluated.  The aorta is tortuous.  ET tube is in
 standard position.  NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.  Right
 PICC tip is in the lower SVC.  Diffuse increased bilateral opacities are due
 to increasing large pleural effusions.  Adjacent opacities likely atelectasis
 have increased.  Increased opacity in the right upper lobe could be
 atelectasis or pneumonia. there is at least mild pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
