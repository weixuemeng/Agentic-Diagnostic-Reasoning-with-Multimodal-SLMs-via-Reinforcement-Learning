 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The patient is markedly rotated limiting evaluation of the cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  A right subclavian PICC line, endotracheal tube and
 nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position.  Streaky bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  Overall, there is less edema and
 improved aeration throughout.  A layering left effusion and likely a smaller
 right effusion are again seen.
