                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with sepsis, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso without contrast ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is significant rightward rotation of the patient on the current
 radiograph.  There are low lung volumes.  Allowing for changes due to these
 factors, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits.  Right
 lung base airspace opacities may represent developing pneumonia or sequelae of
 aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.  Retrocardiac opacity may
 represent subsegmental atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear with mild
 crowding of bronchovascular structures.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and a limited study due to patient positioning.  Within this
 limitation, right lung base airspace opacities may represent pneumonia or
 sequelae of aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Note CTA obtained subsequently shows extensive pulmonary emboli, right lower
 lobe as well as possible pneumonia.
