                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Falls.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs
 are somewhat low in volume with poor visualization of the left costophrenic
 angle, though this is likely due to the epicarrdial fat pad as no pleural
 effusion is seen on the lateral view.  The heart is top normal in size with
 dual lead pacemaker again demonstrated.  Lumbar fusion hardware and
 degenerative shoulder disease is incompletely assessed.  No displaced rib
 fractures or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process
