                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of chest congestion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac silhouette
 remains enlarged, with a globular appearance, which may be due to pericardial
 effusion and underlying cardiomyopathy.  There is minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic angles which may be due to trace pleural effusion.  No focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  The aortic knob is calcified.  There
 is no overt pulmonary edema.  Multiple old right-sided rib fractures are again
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Enlarged cardiac silhouette with globular appearance, as also on the prior
 study, could be due to pericardial effusion or underlying cardiomyopathy. 
 Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles may be due to trace bilateral
 pleural effusions.
