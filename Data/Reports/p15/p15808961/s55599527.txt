  Normal cardiac silhouette. Right upper lung opacity potentially due to
  scarring however given lack of priors to document stability, chest CT is
  suggested for further evaluation on a nonurgent basis to evaluate for
  underlying mass lesion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain  // Please eval for cardiomegaly
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is right apical opacity, some of which has a spiculated margin. Given
 superior retraction of the hilum on the right this could be due to scarring
 although underlying lesion would also be possible. Elsewhere, the lungs are
 clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lung opacity potentially due to scarring however given lack of
 priors to document stability, chest CT is suggested for further evaluation on
 a nonurgent basis to evaluate for underlying mass.
