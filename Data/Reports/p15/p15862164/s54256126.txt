                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with spinal cord acute on chronic injury  // line
 placement; interval status      line placement; interval status
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, scatter radiation related to the size
 of the patient again greatly obscures detail.  The monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Low lung volumes accentuate the transverse
 diameter of the heart.  Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour
 suggests some volume loss in the lower lobe.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary
 vessels would be consistent with mild elevation in pulmonary venous pressure.
