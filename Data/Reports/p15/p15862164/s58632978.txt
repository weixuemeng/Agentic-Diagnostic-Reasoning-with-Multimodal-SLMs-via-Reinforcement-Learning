                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation  // tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment of fine detail is considerably limited by overlying soft tissues
 and underpenetration.  ET tube ends approximately 5 cm above the carina.  The
 enteric tube is seen at least to the level of the lower chest but is not seen
 definitively beyond that.  Lung volumes are low which accentuates likely
 mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 detected.  Patchy opacities in retrocardiac and right cardiophrenic regions
 are indeterminate, as the could be accounted for by atelectasis in the setting
 of low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube in satisfactory position.  NG tube not well visualized beyond the
 level of the mid chest could be further evaluated with KUB, with increased
 penetration.
