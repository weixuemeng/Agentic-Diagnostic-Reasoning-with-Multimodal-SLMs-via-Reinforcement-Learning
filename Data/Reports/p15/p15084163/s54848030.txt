                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New dyspnea and chest pain in a patient with decompensated
 congestive heart failure, recent treatment for COPD and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest, portable.  Limited examination due to underpenetration. 
 Cardiomegaly and diffuse pulmonary edema is consistent with decompensated
 congestive heart failure.  There is, however, a new more dense opacity in the
 left upper lobe as well as a probable new retrocardiac opacity which obscures
 the left hemidiaphragmatic contour.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is
 likely a left pleural effusion, although assessment is limited.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decompensated congestive heart failure with additional denser
 opacities in the left lung which are concerning for pneumonia.
