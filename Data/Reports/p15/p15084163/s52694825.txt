                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of
 four exposures.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The exam is limited due to underpenetration and technique related
 to patient's body habitus.  Again, there is a streaky opacification at the
 left base, which is stable, and likely atelectasis.  Apparent opacification at
 the right base is likely due to overlying soft tissue.  Interstitial
 prominence is stable, and could be due to chronic vascular congestion.  There
 is no overt pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart size is moderately enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Technically limited exam with stable interstitial abnormalities. 
 No evidence of pneumonia or other acute cardiopulmonary process.
