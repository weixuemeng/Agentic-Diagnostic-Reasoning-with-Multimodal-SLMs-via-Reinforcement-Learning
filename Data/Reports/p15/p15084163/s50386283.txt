                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of HIV infection, now with two
 weeks of cough, fever and chills, and dyspnea.  Evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___ and ___.  A chest radiograph from ___, was also reviewed for
 comparison.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal semi-erect chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Examination is limited secondary to patient's body habitus. 
 Compared with prior exam, there is a vague opacity in the right cardiophrenic
 angle. Otherwise, a linear opacity within the peripheral left mid lung is
 unchanged and corresponds to scarring.  Although low lung volumes and
 overlying soft tissue attenuation increase the conspicuity of the interstitial
 markings, it is felt that chronic vascular congestion and interstitial edema
 are present and not significantly changed compared with multiple prior
 radiographs dating back to ___.  No pleural effusion is
 identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Mild apparent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
 likely due to AP technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Vague opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle may represent a focus of
 consolidation although imaging artifact cannot be excluded in this very
 limited exam owing to the patient's body habitus. If there is clinical
 concern, further assessment with CT is recommended.
 2.  Stable appearance of the lung interstitium suggestive of chronic vascular
 congestion and borderline edema.
