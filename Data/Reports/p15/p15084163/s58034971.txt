                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Wheezing and rhonchi, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same date CT abdomen and pelvis and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable frontal chest radiograph was performed.  Evaluation is limited
 by underpenetration from patient body habitus.  Streaky atelectasis seen at
 the left lung base is again compatible with scarring, and better evaluated on
 the same day CT of the abdomen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 There is mild unchanged cardiomegaly and central congestion without overt
 signs of pulmonary edema.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  Right humeral
 orthopedic hardware is partially imaged.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Unchanged cardiomegaly with no acute cardiopulmonary process.
