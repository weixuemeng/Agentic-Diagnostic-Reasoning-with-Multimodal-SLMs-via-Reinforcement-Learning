                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from the same day at 21:50.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is again limited due to patient body habitus.  There has
 been progression of bilateral diffuse interstitial opacities, which are most
 likely representative of mild pulmonary edema.  Additionally, there is an
 opacity in the right upper lobe (between the first and second ribs) with a
 more confluent opacity in the left lower lobe.  Mild cardiomegaly is again
 noted. Post-surgical changes in the right proximal humerus are partially
 visualized. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Limited study due to patient body habitus demonstrates evidence of
 multifocal pneumonia with an opacity in the right upper lobe and a large
 confluent opacity at the left lower lobe. 
 2.  Bilateral increased interstitial opacities concerning for worsening mild
 pulmonary edema.
 3.  Mild cardiomegaly again noted. ___
