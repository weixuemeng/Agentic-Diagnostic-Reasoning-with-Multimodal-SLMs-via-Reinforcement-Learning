                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of asthma and HIV now with dyspnea, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is limited due to underpenetration on technique and
 patient body habitus.  Streaky opacification of the left lung base is again
 noted compatible with scarring or atelectasis.  Prominence of interstitial
 markings may be related to underpenetration but underlying pulmonary edema or
 atypical infection is difficult to exclude.  No significant pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains
 enlarged but stable.  Calcification at the aortic knob is noted.  The trachea
 appears midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Limited examination with unchanged left basilar atelectasis or scarring.
 2.  Prominence of interstitial lung markings likely relate to underpenetration
 although pulmonary edema or atypical infection is not excluded.
