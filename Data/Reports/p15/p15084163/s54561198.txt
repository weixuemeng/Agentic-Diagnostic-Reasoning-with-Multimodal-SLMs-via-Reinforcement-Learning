                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old obese female with epigastric pain.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and concurrent CT abdomen
 and pelvis from ___ at 21:23.
 
 AP SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The examination is extremely limited
 secondary to patient body habitus.  Linear opacity within the peripheral left
 mid lung is unchanged and corresponds to scarring.  No definite confluent
 consolidation is identified.  A bilobed density in the left upper lung is
 unlikely to represent a true consolidation given how misleading the chest
 radiographic findings are as compared to CT appearance of the lung bases.  Low
 lung volumes and overlying soft tissue attenuation cause exaggeration of
 interstitial marking, though no overt edema is evident.  There is no large
 pleural effusion.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Mild apparent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is likely partly due to
 the AP technique and a large epicardial fat pad.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited examination, though no definite pneumonia.
