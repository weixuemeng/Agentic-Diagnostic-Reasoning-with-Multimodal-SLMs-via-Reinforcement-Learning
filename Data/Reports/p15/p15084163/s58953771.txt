                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Poor
 penetration on the lateral view and overlying soft tissue on the frontal view
 makes the evaluation suboptimal.  Scattered areas of linear atelectasis seen
 in the left mid to lower lung.  There is mild elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  There may be minimal pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Partially
 imaged hardware in the right humerus.
