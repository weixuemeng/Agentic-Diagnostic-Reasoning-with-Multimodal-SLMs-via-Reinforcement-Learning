                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:29 AM, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Fracture and shortness of breath.  Assess for possible pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Mediastinal widening is new, and could be due to venous engorgement, which
 along with pulmonary vascular congestion and possible increase in heart size,
 all attest to heart failure.  However, there is particular widening of the
 mediastinum in the region of the aortopulmonic window, which should be
 monitored to exclude either adenopathy or even aortic dissection, and there is
 a focal area of consolidation at the right lung base, which could be
 concurrent pneumonia.  Careful radiographic followup is warranted.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged to report these findings, at the time of
 dictation.
