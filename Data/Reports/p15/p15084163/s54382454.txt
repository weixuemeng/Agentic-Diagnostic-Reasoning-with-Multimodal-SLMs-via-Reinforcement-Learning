                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes.  The study
 is somewhat limited due to patient's body habitus.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unchanged.  Intrathoracic aorta is tortuous.  Heart is mildly
 enlarged, unchanged.  Linear opacity in the left lung base is longstanding and
 likely represents an area of scarring.  There is mild pulmonary edema. 
 Bibasilar opacities are noted, which may reflect atelectasis.  A fixation
 hardware overlying of the right humerus is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities, likely
 atelectasis or infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
