                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chills, nausea,
 vomiting, diarrhea for two days.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The images
 are somewhat underpenetrated due to patient body habitus.  Given this, left
 mid lung linear atelectasis/scarring persists.  No focal consolidation or
 large pleural effusion is seen.  There is prominence of the interstitial
 markings, consistent with interstitial edema, possibly minimally improved
 since the prior study.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial edema, stable to possibly minimally improved.
