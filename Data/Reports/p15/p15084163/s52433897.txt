                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recent ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The exam is severely limited by the patient's body habitus. The right
 costophrenic sulcus on anterior view and posterior costophrenic sulci on later
 view are not imaged.  Within the limits of this study, the lungs appear well
 expanded.  A linear opacity in the left mid lung is unchanged, likely
 scarring/chronic atelectasis.  Interstitial markings are exaggerated due to
 overlying soft tissue, however there are no definite focal opacities to
 suggest pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  The heart size is exaggerated on the AP view.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Study limited by body habitus and an incompletely imaged costophrenic sulci,
 however there is no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
