                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable AP view of the chest was provided.  The heart
 is top normal in size.  There is mild diffuse ground-glass pulmonary opacity,
 which could represent pulmonary edema, less likely a typical infection.  No
 large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Bony structures are intact.  Hardware
 partially visualized in the right proximal humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild ground-glass diffuse pulmonary opacity is concerning for
 pulmonary edema.  Mild cardiomegaly also again noted.
