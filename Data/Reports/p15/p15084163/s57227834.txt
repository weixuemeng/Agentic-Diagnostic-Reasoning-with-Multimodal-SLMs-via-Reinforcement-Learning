                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Question widened mediastinum on prior exam.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 Widened mediastinum is again noted, less conspicuous than before, due to
 impoved vascular congestion.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  Bibasilar opacities
 have improved on the right, and are stable on the left.  There is no obvious
 mass in the AP window, pneumothorax, or enlarging pleural effusions.
