                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with back pain and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Semi-upright portable chest radiographs were obtained.  The examination is
 limited due to poor penetration likely secondary to body habitus and portable
 technique without evidence of focal consolidation.  Retrocardiac opacities are
 not well assessed on this single radiograph but appear improved compared to
 the radiograph from ___.  For better evaluation, consider PA and lateral
 views.  Heart is moderately enlarged. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement
 appears slightly improved. Right humeral fixation hardware is incompletely
 assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved retrocardiac opacities and pulmonary vascular congestion
 on this limited study.  For better evaluation, two-view chest radiograph could
 be obtained.
