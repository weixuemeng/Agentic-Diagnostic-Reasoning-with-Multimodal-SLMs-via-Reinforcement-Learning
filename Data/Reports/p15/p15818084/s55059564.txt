                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, evaluate for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  A horizontally oriented linear opacity is
 again seen in the right lower lung, which likely represents the scar given its
 stability over time.  There is left basilar atelectasis.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  Moderate cardiomegaly and elevated right hemidiaphragm are
 unchanged.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.  The pulmonary
 vascular markings are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Also noted is stable calcification of the tracheobronchial tree as well as a
 tortuous aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia or CHF exacerbation.
