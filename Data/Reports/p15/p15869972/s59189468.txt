                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multiple rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference CT available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A trauma board overlies the patient.  The heart
 size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. 
 The lungs are underinflated, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Linear
 bibasilar opacities are most compatible with atelectasis.  Multiple left rib
 fractures are better evaluated on the CT torso examination performed earlier.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Multiple left rib fractures, better seen on recent CT examination.
 2.  Linear bibasilar pulmonary opacities likely representing atelectasis in
 the setting of low lung volumes. Refer to CT for further details.
