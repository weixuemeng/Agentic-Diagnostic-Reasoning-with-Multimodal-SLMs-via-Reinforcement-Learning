                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with congested cough > 1 week.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature and left lower
 lobe atelectasis.  Triangular-shaped opacity along the right cardiophrenic
 angle is stable and consistent with prominent fat pad.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size,
 mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.  A tortuous aorta with aortic
 arch calcifications are noted.
 
 Visualized osseous structures are notable for a stable chest left cage
 deformity.  Partially visualized right shoulder replacement with stable
 superior subluxation of the left humeral head, unchanged since prior
 examination.  Stable mild anterior compression deformity of a mid thoracic
 vertebral body is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild left lower lobe atelectasis.  No pneumonia.
