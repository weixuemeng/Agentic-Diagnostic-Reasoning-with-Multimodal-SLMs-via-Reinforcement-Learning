                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough, sputum. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views. Mild cardiomegaly and a tortuous, calcified aorta are
 again seen. Aortic tortuosity is likely in part related to dextroconvex
 thoracic scoliosis. Hilar contours are stable.  There is unchanged mild linear
 atelectasis or scarring in the left mid and lower lung fields, including the
 left lateral costophrenic angle.  There is no evidence for pulmonary
 consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion.  Degenerative changes are
 again seen in the spine. There appears to be mild anterior wedging of several
 mid thoracic vertebral bodies, unchanged on but evaluation of vertebral body
 height is limited by scoliosis. Right glenohumeral arthroplasty is again
 partially visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence for active cardiopulmonary disease.
