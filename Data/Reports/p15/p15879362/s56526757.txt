                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with septic shock and pneumonia.  Please evaluate
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___.
 Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to ___, there is homogeneous opacification of the right
 hemithorax, likely from increased pleural fluid, which partially obscures
 previously-seen focal consolidation in the right lower lobe.  The left lung is
 mostly clear.  The heart is enlarged  compared to prior and the pulmonary
 vessels appear more prominent, likely from fluid resuscitation.  However,
 there is not evidence for pulmonary edema.
 ET tube terminates approximately 7.5 cm from the carina.  Right-sided
 Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
 Larger effusion
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube approximately 7.5 cm from the carina.
 2. No pulmonary edema.
 3. Increased right pleural fluid obscuring a large right lower lobe
 consolidation.
