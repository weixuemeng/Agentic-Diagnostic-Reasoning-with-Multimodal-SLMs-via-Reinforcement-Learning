  Interval placement of a left-sided pacer/defibrillator with multiple leads in
  expected position. No pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal consolidation.
  Linear opacities at the bases are consistent with atelectasis. Cardiomegaly is
  stable given differences in projection. Lung volumes are somewhat low. There
  is mild pulmonary vascular congestion as well as probable mild pulmonary
  edema.
