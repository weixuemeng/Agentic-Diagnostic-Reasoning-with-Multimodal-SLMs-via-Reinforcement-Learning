                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and cough. Rule out infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are well inflated.  There is a small right pleural effusion with fluid
 tracking into the minor fissure and possible pleural thickening/scarring at
 the right lung base. Patchy opacity at the right lung base is presumably
 atelectasis, however, infection cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax.
 There is a small granuloma in the left upper lung.
 
 The heart is normal size. There is no evidence for pulmonary edema. The
 mediastinal and hilar structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion with overlying opacity which could be infection
 or atelectasis.
