                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 blunting of the bilateral posterior costophrenic angles suggesting trace
 pleural effusions.  Mild basilar atelectasis is seen.  Retrocardiac air-fluid
 level is again seen, consistent with hiatal hernia.  Areas of mid lung
 atelectasis/scarring are also seen.  Surgical clips are noted in the upper
 quadrant.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Hiatal hernia.
 2.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
