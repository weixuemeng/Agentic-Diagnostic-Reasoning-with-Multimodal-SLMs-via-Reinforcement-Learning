                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white blood cell count, evaluate for pneumonia or acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ in ___.  CT torso
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  The lung volumes are
 low, which has resulted in vascular crowding.  Obscuration of the left heart
 border is thought to be secondary to the high diaphragm.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Deviation of the trachea towards the right, likely
 from a large tortuous aorta, is unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 moderately enlarged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
