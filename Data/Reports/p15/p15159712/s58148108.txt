 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate left PIC catheter tip
 projecting over mid SVC.  Right-sided PIC catheter has been removed.  Lung
 volumes are low, exaggerating the caliber of normal vessels.  Lungs are clear
 except right basal scarring or atelectasis around bronchiectasis.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly and a generally large and tortuous aorta are chronic.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Right lung base opacities are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly and aortic tortuousity.
 
 2.  Right lung basal scarring or bronchiectasis.
