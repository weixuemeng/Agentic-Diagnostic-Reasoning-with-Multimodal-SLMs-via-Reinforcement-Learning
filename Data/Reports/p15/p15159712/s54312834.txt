  Low lung volumes cause exaggeration of heart size and accentuation of the
  pulmonary vasculature.  The degree of central pulmonary vascular congestion
  continues to increase.  Increased left retrocardiac opacification may be
  secondary to atelectasis, although infection in this region is not excluded. 
  There are no definite pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with AMS.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison number prior study from ___ at 1:27 a.m.
 
 There are low lung volumes that cause exaggeration of the heart size and
 accentuation of pulmonary vascular markings.  The vascular pedicle appears
 widened, which also supports the diagnosis of pulmonary edema.  The degree of
 vascular congestion continues to increase.  There is a left retrocardiac
 opacity which may be due to atelectasis or focal consolidation.  There are no
 definite pleural effusions.  No pneumothoraces are seen.
