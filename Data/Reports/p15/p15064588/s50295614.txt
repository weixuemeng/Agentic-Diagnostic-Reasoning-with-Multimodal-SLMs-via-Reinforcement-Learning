                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia, now off antibiotics, with decreased
 breath sounds.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___.
 
 Previous interstitial pulmonary edema has improved.  Right lower lobe has
 partially cleared, but lateral view suggests some persistent consolidation,
 which could be the remnants of pneumonia.  Small right pleural effusion is
 new, but does not explain decreased breath sounds.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar silhouettes are normal.  Left lung is essentially clear.
