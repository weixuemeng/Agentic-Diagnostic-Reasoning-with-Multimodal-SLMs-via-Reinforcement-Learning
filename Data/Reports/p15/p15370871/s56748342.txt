                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LUL resection  // f/u      f/u
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison a prior study dated ___ at 21:08
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left chest tube and right internal jugular Port-A-Cath are unchanged.  Left
 apical opacity representing expected postoperative changes in this patient
 status post left upper lobectomy.  Lung volumes remain low and there is
 crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. Patchy opacity at the left base most
 likely reflects atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Stable
 right upper lobe peripheral opacity which remains concerning for aspiration or
 pneumonia, less likely edema.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No large
 pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished
 given supine technique.
