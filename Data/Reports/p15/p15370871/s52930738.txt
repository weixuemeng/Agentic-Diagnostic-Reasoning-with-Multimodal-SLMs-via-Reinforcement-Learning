                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p LULobectomy with new hypotension, oxygen
 requirement.  // eval LULobectomy      eval LULobectomy
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 08:08
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left chest tube and right internal jugular Port-A-Cath are unchanged in
 position.  There is expected increasing opacity at the left apex in this
 patient status post left upper lobectomy.  Lung volumes have diminished. There
 is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature but no overt pulmonary edema.
 However, in the right upper lobe peripherally, a patchy opacity has developed
 and this would be concerning for aspiration or developing pneumonia.  Clinical
 correlation is advised and followup imaging should be performed as needed. 
 Heart remains stable in size.  No large pneumothorax.
