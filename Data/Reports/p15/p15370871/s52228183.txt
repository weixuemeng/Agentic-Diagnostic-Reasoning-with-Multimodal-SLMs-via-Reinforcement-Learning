                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Low oxygen saturation.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  A Port-A-Cath
 resides over the right chest wall with catheter tip extending to the level of
 the mid SVC.  The heart and mediastinal contour is stable.  There is diffuse
 bilateral ground-glass opacity which could represent pulmonary edema, though
 an atypical infection is difficult to exclude.  Please correlate clinically. 
 The known left upper lobe mass is poorly visualized.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart and mediastinal contour appear stable.  Bony structures
 are intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pulmonary ground-glass opacity concerning for pulmonary
 edema or atypical pneumonia.  Left upper lobe lung mass poorly visualized.
