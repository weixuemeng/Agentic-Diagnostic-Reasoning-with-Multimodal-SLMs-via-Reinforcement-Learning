                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis, NG tube position.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:53 p.m.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.0 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm, off the film.  The presence
 or absence of a side port is difficult to determine due to underpenetration. 
 If a sideport is present, it could lie in the region of the GE junction.  A
 right-sided indwelling catheter is present, tip near SVC/RA junction.  A
 left-sided PIC line is present, tip overlying distal SVC near SVC/RA junction.
 
 There is dense opacification in the left upper zone as well as in the left
 lower lobe, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  The right lung shows
 diffuse interstitial and alveolar infiltrate, somewhat more confluent at the
 right base peripherally.  Small bilateral effusions would be difficult to
 exclude in this setting.  Clips noted over left lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube tip in satisfactory position approximately 4.0 cm above the
 carina.
 
 2.  NG tube tip extends beneath the diaphgram, off the film. ? sideport --
 plase see comment above.
 
 3.  Extensive pulmonary parenchymal changes are similar to the prior film.
