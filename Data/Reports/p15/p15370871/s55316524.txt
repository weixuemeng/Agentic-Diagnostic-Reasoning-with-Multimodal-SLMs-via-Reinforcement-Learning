                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 COMPARISON:  CXR from ___
 
 A right-sided indwelling catheter tip overlies the mid/distal SVC.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, I doubt overt CHF. 
 Minimal atelectasis at the left base, with equivocal slight obscuration of the
 left costophrenic angle.  Otherwise, no focal consolidation or gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal patchy opacity at left base may be explained by
 atelectasis, but the possibility of an early pneumonic infiltrate cannot be
 entirely excluded.
