                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent lobectomy and chest tube removal,
 desatting  // assess for pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 04:27
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly
 decreased.  These causes increased crowding of vascular and airway structures,
 notably on the right.  However, short term radiographic followup should be
 performed to exclude pulmonary edema.
 On the left, the chest tube has been removed.  The presence of a small post
 lobectomy pneumothorax cannot be excluded, based on the sharp margin of a
 partially collapsed left paramediastinal lung segment.  Unchanged appearance
 of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged right pectoral Port-A-Cath.
