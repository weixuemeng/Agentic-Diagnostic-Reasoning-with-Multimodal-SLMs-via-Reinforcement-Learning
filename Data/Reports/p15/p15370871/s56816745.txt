                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with history of left upper lobectomy and COPD
 presenting with worsening dyspnea, hypoxia, and cough; evaluate for new
 consolidation or etiology of clinical decompensation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the right-sided Port-A-Cath is ill-defined but likely ends in the
 distal SVC, unchanged.  Interval decreased aeration of the lungs with
 persistent low lung volumes.  Post left upper lobectomy changes in the left
 upper hemithorax are expected and unchanged.  Aeration of the remaining left
 lung is reduced.   Asymmetric opacification of the lower lung may reflect a
 combination of atelectasis or small left pleural effusion, or may be
 projectional.  Heart size cannot be adequately assessed as the borders are not
 well-defined on the left, although is probably a normal, similar to the prior
 exam.  No overt pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Blunting of left costophrenic sulcus could be projectional or may reflect a
 small pleural effusion.  Repeat standard PA chest radiograph is recommended
 for initial further evaluation, particularly as there was no evidence of
 pleural effusion on recent CT torso 5 days earlier.
