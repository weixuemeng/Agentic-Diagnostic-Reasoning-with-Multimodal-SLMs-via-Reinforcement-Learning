                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post recent left upper lobe resection, with
 left chest tube in place.  A large homogeneous opacity in the left apex has
 slightly decreased in size and appears to have both pleural and parenchymal
 components on recent CT of one day earlier.  Small left apical
 hydropneumothorax is present, adjacent to the tip of the left chest tube,
 better demonstrated on recent CT.  As compared to the recent radiograph, there
 has been slight improved aeration in the left apex, left mid and lower lung
 regions.  However, diffuse heterogeneous opacities throughout the right lung
 have slightly worsened, and could be due to asymmetrical edema, or an evolving
 infection.
