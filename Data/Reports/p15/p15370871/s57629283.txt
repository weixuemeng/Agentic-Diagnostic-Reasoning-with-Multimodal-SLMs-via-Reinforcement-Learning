                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with s/p left lung lobectomy here with weakness  //
 evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The study is suboptimal of the patient is rotated to the left on the frontal
 view and the patient's arm overlies the lateral views. There is persistent
 left upper hemithorax opacification in this patient with history of left upper
 lobectomy. Left basilar opacity is not well assessed, in part relate to
 cardiac silhouette however there may be a pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis, consolidation not excluded. Findings worrisome for pulmonary
 edema. More linear in configuration right mid lung opacity could be due to
 atelectasis however infectious process is not excluded. No large right pleural
 effusion is seen but there may be a trace right pleural effusion. . A
 right-sided Port-A-Cath is again seen command terminating the expected
 location of the low SVC/ cavoatrial junction.
