 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of shortness of breath.

 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Prominence of the central pulmonary
 vasculature is also stable to mildly increased.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.

 may be due to pulmonary vascular engorgement/hypertension.  No focal
 consolidation seen.
