 similar study of ___.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No
 typical configurational abnormality is identified.  Thoracic aorta mildly
 widened and elongated but without local contour abnormalities.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal
 infiltrates are present, and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are
 free.  No pneumothorax in the apical area on the frontal view.  Skeletal
 structures of the thorax grossly unremarkable.  In comparison with the next
 preceding study of ___, no significant interval change can be
 identified.  Thus chest findings remain normal with no evidence of
 cardiovascular or pulmonary abnormalities.
