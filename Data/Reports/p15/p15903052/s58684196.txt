 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:33 AM
  
  
  Compared with ___
  The mediastinal vessels appear more congested than on prior examinations
  though more peripheral vessels are well-defined, consistent with probable mild
  vascular congestion without florid edema.  There is a right infrahilar opacity
  that was not definitively seen on comparison though lung volumes are slightly
  lower on the current examination.  In the appropriate clinical context, this
  may represent a right middle lobe pneumonia.  A left-sided pacemaker is in
  stable position.
