                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chest pain left lower pectoral  // left
 lower pectoral chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and shows mural
 calcification at its arch.  Lung volumes are low which accentuate
 bronchovascular markings.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A right third rib fracture is unchanged in
 appearance.
 
 Of note, there are low lung volumes on the frontal view which accentuates the
 transverse diameter of the heart and bronchovascular markings.  Bibasilar
 opacities on the frontal view are most likely due to atelectasis, and are not
 demonstrated on the lateral view with a better inspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
