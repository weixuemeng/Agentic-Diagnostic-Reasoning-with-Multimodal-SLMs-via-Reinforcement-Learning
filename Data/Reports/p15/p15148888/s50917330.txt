                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough x 2 weeks  // rule out pneumonia     
 rule out pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a much deeper
 inspiration.  There is suggestion of some asymmetric opacification at the
 right base, possibly seen posteriorly on the lateral view.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, this could represent an area of developing consolidation.
 Of incidental note, there is again evidence of a healed fracture of the distal
 right clavicle.
