                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with resp failure.  // Please eval for line
 placement in particular.      Please eval for line placement in particular.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ 05:05
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest radiograph ___ at 05:10 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip 5.5 cm above the carinal. 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below this diaphragm with the tip projecting
 over the stomach.  Left internal jugular central line, right internal jugular
 central line and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stably enlarged.  There are moderate to
 large bilateral layering pleural effusions and increasing perihilar fullness
 and vascular indistinctness suggestive of mild to moderate pulmonary edema. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive lower lobe atelectasis
 given the effusions.  No obvious pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to
 detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
