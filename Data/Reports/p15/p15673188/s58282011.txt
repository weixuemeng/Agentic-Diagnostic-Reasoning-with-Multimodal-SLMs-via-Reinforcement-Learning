                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, cough, and fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, causing accentuation of the pulmonary
 vasculature and exaggeration of the heart size.  There are bilateral
 reticulonodular opacities in both lower lobes, possibly secondary to an
 atypical infectious process.  No lobar consolidation is seen.  The heart size
 is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Surgical clips are seen in the
 right upper abdominal quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Bilateral reticulonodular opacities in both
 lower lobes, possibly crowded bronchovasculature and atypical infectious
 process.
