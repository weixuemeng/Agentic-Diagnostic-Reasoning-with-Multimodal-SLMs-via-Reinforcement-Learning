  The thoracic aorta is tortuous.  Platelike atelectasis is noted in the left
  midlung.  Atelectasis is noted at the lung bases bilaterally.  No evidence of
  pneumonia.  Heart size is normal.  A right IJ line ends in the mid SVC.  A
  right chest port ends in the low SVC.  A surgical drain projects over the
  right upper quadrant.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ T3N0 rectal cancer metastatic to liver (seg VI) s/p LAR
 ___   FOLFIRI here for exploratory laparotomy, R hepatic lobectomy, CCY  //
 assess for pneumonia     assess for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is a right IJ catheter
 extending to the mid portion of the SVC a right subclavian PICC line that
 extends to the cavoatrial junction.  Increased opacification at the right base
 is consistent with pleural fluid and substantial volume loss in the right
 lower and possibly right middle lobes.  Streaks of platelike atelectasis are
 seen at the left base.
 No definite vascular congestion.
