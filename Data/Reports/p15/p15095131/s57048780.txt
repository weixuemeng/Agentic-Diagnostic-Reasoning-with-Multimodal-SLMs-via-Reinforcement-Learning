                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea. Rule out pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An irregularly shaped ___ mm wide opacity projecting over the intersection of
 the anterior right sixth and posterior ninth ribs is presumably the right
 nipple or real a, but should be confirmed by shallow oblique views with nipple
 markers.
 
 A vague region of new opacification in the left midlung the medial to the
 anterior end of the fifth rib could be due to a superimposition of structures,
 specifically soft tissue in the chest wall, but might instead be an early
 pneumonia. The oblique views would re-examined this finding as well.
 
 Lungs are otherwise clear. Pleural surfaces are smooth. Heart size is normal.
 Fullness in the right paratracheal region of the mediastinum has been a
 chronic feature since at least ___, therefore not clinically significant
 adenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small likelihood of early pneumonia left midlung and possible right lung
 nodule should be evaluated with shallow oblique views implying nipple markers.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to ___ ___ nurses by email on
 ___ at 8:19 AM.
