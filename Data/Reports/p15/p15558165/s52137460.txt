                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ERCP, now with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices have been removed.  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic
 contour with areas of opacification above it.  These most likely reflect
 atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
 
 The upper lungs are clear and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
