                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right chest tube removed one hour prior.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___ and allowing for differences in positioning, small right
 apical pneumothorax appears similar to ___ at 15:32 p.m.  Possible trace
 anterior pneumothorax on the lateral view.  
 
 There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle posteriorly consistent with
 a small amount of pleural fluid/thickening is noted.  The right hemidiaphragm
 is slightly elevated, similar to prior.  No CHF or effusion is identified. 
 Incidental note is made of asymmetry of the scapulae, higher on the left --
 this is not observed on the prior films and is presumably positional.
 
 IMPRESSION: Small right apical pneumothorax is not significantly changed.
