                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post liver transplant, evaluate for interval change,
 pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 20:37 p.m.
 
 The possibility of a small residual right pneumothorax cannot be excluded,
 though it is probably smaller in size compared with the prior study.  There is
 lucency at the base of the right lung, which could reflect pneumothorax. 
 Curvilinear lucency projecting over the lung may be an artifact due to skin
 folds.  Curvilinear lucency along the left hemidiaphragm is more suggestive of
 air beneath the diaphragm and skin ___ are noted over the abdomen.  
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or gross
 effusion is identified.  Minimal opacity posteriorly in the left lung is not
 significantly changed.  Though there was no evidence of a posterior
 diaphragmatic hernia on the ___ CT, the possibility of some loculated
 pleural fluid, or focal rounded atelectasis is considered.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Suspect small right pneumothorax, though this is decreased in size
 compared with earlier the same day.  
 
 2.  Probable small amount of air beneath the left hemidiaphragm newly visible
 compared with the prior film.
 
 3.  Focal opacity in the left lung posteriorly, question focal atelectasis or
 pleural fluid.  Lungs are otherwise grossly clear.
