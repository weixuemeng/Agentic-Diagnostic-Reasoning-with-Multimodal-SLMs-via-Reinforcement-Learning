                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postop day ___ liver transplant with fevers, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 Compared with ___, there is considerable interval enlargement of the right
 pleural effusion.  The effusion is now small-to-moderate in size, with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Otherwise, I doubt significant
 interval change. Again seen is minimal atelectasis at the left base, without
 left-sided effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. 
 There is no evidence of CHF.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Small-to-moderate right effusion and underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation, significantly progressed compared with ___.  The
 possibility of an underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
