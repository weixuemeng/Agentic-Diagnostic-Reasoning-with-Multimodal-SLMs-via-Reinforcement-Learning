                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Film obtained on ___.
 
 Compared to the earlier film, there is now relatively dense consolidation of
 the right upper zone, with obscuration of the right paratracheal mediastinal
 contour.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated, but unchanged.  Allowing for
 patient rotation, there is increased rightward tracheal deviation.  Left base
 consolidation and small left effusion are again noted.  ET tube in
 satisfactory position 4.0 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip beneath diaphragm
 ,overlying stomach.  Right subclavian central line tip not optimally
 visualized, but appears to overlie the proximal/mid SVC.  Multiple left-sided
 rib fractures, concerning for flail chest, again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New or marked progression of right upper zone collapse and/or consolidation. 
 Deviation of the trachea suggests some associated volume loss.  No evidence of
 right or left pneumothorax detected on the current film.  
 
 Findings called to the floor at the time of discovery at 8:___ a.m. on ___
 and discussed with Dr. ___ at approximately 9:___ am (___, phone).
