 WET READ: ___ ___ ___:___ PM
  Interval placement of left apical chest tube.  No definitive evidence of
  pneumothorax.  Otherwise, stable position of support devices and unchanged
  appearance of the chest.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post ___ with left hemithorax, rib fracture.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 4:___ a.m.
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position
 approximately 3.7 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip and side
 port overlying left upper quadrant.  A left chest tube is present, new
 compared with the earlier film.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is some patchy increased
 retrocardiac density with blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  The
 effusion is new and the basal opacity has progressed compared with the prior
 study.  Note is made of multiple left-sided rib fractures.  No pneumothorax is
 detected on the current film.  On the right side, there is curvilinear density
 along the right side of the lung.  This may be accounted for by an area of
 atelectasis or scarring as seen on the ___ CT scan, but taken alone, it
 is difficult to exclude an unusual pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of left-sided chest tube.
 2.  Worsening consolidation and effusion at the left base.
 3.  Unusual linear opacity adjacent to the right chest wall.  Based on recent
 CT, this likely represents atelectasis and/or scarring.  It would otherwise be
 concerning for a right-sided pneumothorax.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at approximately 9:___ am on ___
 (___, phone).
