 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ M s/p evacuation of intraabdominal hematoma and resuscitation;
 increasing O2 requirement, decreasing sat and tachycardia  // Rule out acute
 cardiopulmonary process     Rule out acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Opacification at both lung bases could be atelectasis
 alone or recent aspiration or early pneumonia.  An oblong well circumscribed
 lucency at the base of the left lung projected over the left heart border
 could be a bulla or a herniated loop of bowel.  There is no CT scan of the
 abdomen chest to clarify this.  Close followup advised.
 
 Left pleural effusion is small.  Similar right pleural effusion is likely.  No
 pneumothorax.  Heart size normal.
