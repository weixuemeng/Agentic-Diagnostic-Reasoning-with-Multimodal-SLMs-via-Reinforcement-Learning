                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p CT placement to waterseal  // ?
 pneumothorax; please do at 10pm, thanks!
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided chest tubes remain in place, with no visible pneumothorax,
 although exclusion of right costophrenic sulcus from the radiograph precludes
 full assessment for basilar pneumothorax. Allowing for differences in
 technique and projection, there is no relevant change in the appearance of the
 chest.
