 Fiducial marker in the left lower lobe opacity is no longer seen in this
 patient status post transbronchial biopsy in ___ which was negative for
 malignancy.  Lungs remain hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema. 
 There are patchy peripheral opacities in the left lung base and to a lesser
 extent in the right lung base.  Overall, it appears that the opacities at the
 left base are  slightly more confluent when compared to the prior study
 suggesting an ongoing infectious process.  No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary
 edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No pneumothorax.
