                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with fever and dry cough, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 There is a new mass-like consolidation which originates from the left hilum
 and extends into the left upper lobe.  There is associated mild upper lobe
 volume loss, manifested by mild leftward tracheal deviation, upward
 displacement of the left hilum, and slight tenting of the left hemidiaphragm. 
 There is also some mild streaky atelectasis in the left lower lobe.  The right
 lung is essentially clear.  No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary
 edema is seen.  A small granuloma is again visualized in the right lung
 overlying the fifth posterior rib laterally.  The heart size is normal.  There
 is a small hiatal hernia, unchanged from prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mass-like consolidation in the left upper lobe as described
 above. This may represent an infectious pneumonia given clinical suspicion for
 infection.  Recommend short-term radiograph followup to assess for response to
 antibiotics in order to ensure resolution and to exclude underlying
 malignancy.
