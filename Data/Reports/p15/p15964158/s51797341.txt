                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remains in standard
 position.  Previously visualized aspirated barium in the right bronchial tree
 is no longer apparent.  Bilateral layering pleural effusions are likely
 unchanged allowing for positional differences, with persistent adjacent
 atelectasis.
