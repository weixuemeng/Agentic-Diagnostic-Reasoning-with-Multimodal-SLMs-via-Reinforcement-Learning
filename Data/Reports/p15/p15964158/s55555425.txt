                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from approximately 30 minutes earlier.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest tube position, assess location of tip.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided.  Again seen is
 the right chest tube with tip at the medial aspect of the right lung. 
 Retraction by approximately 14 cm would result in a location at the right lung
 apex.  There is minimal residual right pneumothorax.  Extensive right chest
 wall emphysema is again noted as well as displaced right rib fractures.
