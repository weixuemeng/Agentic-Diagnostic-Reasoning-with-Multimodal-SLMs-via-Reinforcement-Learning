                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 11:27
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right chest tube to waterseal, evaluate
 for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 13:49.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 11:27 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left subclavian PICC line unchanged in position.  Right chest tube remains
 in place.  No pneumothorax.  Layering bilateral effusions, associated patchy
 airspace process, most likely representing compressive atelectasis and
 resolving pulmonary contusion at least on the right in the setting of multiple
 right-sided displaced rib fractures.  Overall, airspace process seems to be
 improving.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient
 positioning between studies.
