                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recent rib fractures with hemothorax on ___, concern
 for worsening shortness of breath, question acute intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lungs are
 clear and well inflated.  There is air below the right hemidiaphragm which is
 of unclear etiology and may reside within interposed bowel loops adjacent to
 the liver though the possibility of free air is also a concern.  Correlation
 with left lateral decubitus views or CT recommended.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Old right rib
 deformities are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Question or free air below the right hemidiaphragm.  If clinical
 concern for free air is low, left lateral decubitus views may be helpful to
 confirm. Otherwise abdominopelvic CT recommended to further assess.
