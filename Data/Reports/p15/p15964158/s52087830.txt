                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Desaturation, status post gastrostomy tube placement.  Concern
 for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from same day
 timed 6:01 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval worsening
 opacification of the right lung consistent with fluid overload and pulmonary
 edema.  There may be some additional atelectasis of the right lung, although
 it is difficult to determine on this study.  Repositioning of the chest tube
 may be helpful.  The left lung is unchanged compared to the prior.  Support
 devices remain in unchanged position with the exception of interval removal of
 an NG tube.
 
 
 CONCLUSION:  New right pulmonary edema which has acutely worsened since the
 prior exam.  Repositioning of the chest tube may be of some benefit.
