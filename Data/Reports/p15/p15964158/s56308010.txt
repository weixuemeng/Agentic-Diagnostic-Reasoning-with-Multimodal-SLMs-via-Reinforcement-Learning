 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval intubation with endotracheal tube in standard position
 about 5 cm above the carina.  New tubular collection of contrast is present
 corresponding to the pattern of a bronchus in the right infrahilar region
 consistent with aspirated oral contrast in the setting of visualized oral
 contrast within the imaged portion of the upper stomach.  Nasogastric tube is
 in place with sideport projecting proximal to GE junction level. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for positional
 and projectional differences.  Moderate left and large layering right pleural
 effusions are present, as well as persistent bilateral lower lobe opacities in
 keeping with extensive atelectasis in this region demonstrated on recent CTA
 of earlier the same date.  Multiple acute right rib fractures are also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Aspirated barium in the right bronchial tree.
 2.  Sideport of NG tube in proximal location but has subsequently been
 advanced on a followup radiograph.
 3.  Large right and moderate left layering pleural effusions.
