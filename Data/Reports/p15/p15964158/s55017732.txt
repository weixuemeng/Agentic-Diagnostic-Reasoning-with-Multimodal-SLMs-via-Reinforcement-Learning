                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pigtail catheter placement for pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in
 the appearance of the regular and pigtail catheters on the right.  No evidence
 of pneumothorax.  The costophrenic angle on this side is more sharply seen
 than on the previous study.
 
 On the left, there is stable chronic apical pneumothorax.  The degree of
 opacification in the retrocardiac region has decreased.  However, it is
 unclear whether this reflects improved atelectasis and effusion or merely a
 more upright position of the patient.  Pigtail catheter is again seen on this
 side.
