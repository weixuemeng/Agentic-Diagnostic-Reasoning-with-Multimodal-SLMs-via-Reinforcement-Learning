                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Perforated sigmoid diverticulitis, assessment for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has a right
 chest tube.  An air-fluid level is seen on the right, suggesting the presence
 of intrapleural air.  However, the apical pneumothorax line, seen on the
 previous radiograph, no longer visible on the current image.  The nasogastric
 tube has been removed, but the left PICC line remains in situ.  Changed
 appearance of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild decrease in extent of the pleural
 effusion.  The atelectasis at the left lung base and in the retrocardiac areas
 is unchanged.
