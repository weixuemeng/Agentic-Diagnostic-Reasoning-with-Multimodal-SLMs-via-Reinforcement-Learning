                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 AP single view of the chest has been obtained at 13:02 hours on ___. 
 This is a followup examination to a preceding similar study obtained at 10:16
 hours the same day.  The ___-year-old male patient has a right-sided
 pneumothorax with signs of tension and moderate mediastinal shift towards the
 left.  On this followup examination, one can identify the placement of an NG
 tube which reaches below the diaphragm.  The patient is now intubated, the ETT
 terminating in the trachea, some 6 cm above the level of the carina. 
 Left-sided PICC line remains in unchanged position.  The previously described
 right-sided chest tube remains in unchanged position terminating close to the
 chest midline at the level of the hilum.  Remarkable is that the previously
 described mediastinal shift towards the left remains rather unchanged thus
 indicating continuing evidence of tension in the right hemithorax.  Referring
 surgeon, Dr. ___, was reached via page and telephone and was made
 aware of the findings at 2:20 p.m.
