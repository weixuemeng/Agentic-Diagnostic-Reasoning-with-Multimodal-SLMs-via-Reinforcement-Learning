                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia and fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 patchy bibasilar mid lung opacities bilaterally, raising concern for
 multifocal infection.  Alternatively, the superimposed aspiration is not
 excluded.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal mid and lower lung opacities raise concern for
 multifocal infection.  Recommend followup to resolution.
