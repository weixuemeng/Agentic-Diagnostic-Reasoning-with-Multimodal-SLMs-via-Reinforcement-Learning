 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with increased respiratory effort.
 
 COMPARISON:  Film from earlier the same day at 435 and from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  When compared to film from
 earlier the same day, there has been no significant interval change.  Again
 seen are bilateral mid lung and lower lobe opacities, worse on the right than
 on the left.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, noting
 atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic arch.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal regions of consolidation worrisome for infection for
 which followup is suggested after treatment to document resolution.
