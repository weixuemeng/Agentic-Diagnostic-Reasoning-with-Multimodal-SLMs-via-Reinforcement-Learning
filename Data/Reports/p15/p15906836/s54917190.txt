                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of recent pneumonia with decreased breath sounds at the left
 lung base.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with the most recent chest CTA
 from ___ and the most recent chest radiograph from ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Previously visualized bilateral opacities involving the right mid and lower
 lung and left lower lobe are again noted and appear minimally increased over
 the right lung but improved on the left.  Additionally, there is mild
 cephalization of the vasculature with interlobular septal thickening
 suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  Cardiac mediastinal structures otherwise
 stable with atherosclerotic aortic arch.  No acute fractures are noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Previously visualized bilateral opacities involving the right mid and lower
 lung and left lower lobe suggestive of multifocal pneumonia are again noted
 and appear minimally increased over the right lung but improved on the left;
 suggesting pneumonia or recurrent aspiration. Additionally, there is mild
 cephalization of the vasculature with interlobular septal thickening
 suggesting mild pulmonary edema.
