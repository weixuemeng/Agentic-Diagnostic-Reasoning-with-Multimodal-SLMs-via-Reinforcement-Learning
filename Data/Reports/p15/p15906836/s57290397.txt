                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a moderate pleural effusion on the right and probably a small to
 moderate one on the left side. Pulmonary edema is mild to moderate in
 severity. It is likely that there is substantial atelectasis associated with
 pleural effusions in the lower lobes. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are largely obscured at the base of the chest.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with congestive heart failure with pleural effusions.
