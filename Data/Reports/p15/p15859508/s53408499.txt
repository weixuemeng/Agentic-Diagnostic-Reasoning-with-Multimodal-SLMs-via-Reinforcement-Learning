                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and chest CT from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are two fiducial markers at the left hilum, where there is again a
 lobular mass with opacification of the left mid to lower lung, signifying a
 pleural effusion that is probably moderate to large in size.  The right lung
 remains clear. Findings appear unchanged allowing for differences in technique
 since a scout view from the prior chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probably stable abnormalities in the left lung, although radiography is not
 sensitive for small to moderate but possibly significant changes in the status
 of malignancy compared to CT.
