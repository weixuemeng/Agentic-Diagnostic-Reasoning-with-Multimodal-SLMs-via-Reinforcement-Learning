                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of lung cancer presenting with dyspnea
 since last night. Decreased breath sounds left lung
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears moderately enlarged, perhaps slightly
 increased from the previous chest radiograph.  Fiducial markers are again seen
 in the left perihilar region.  Previously noted right lower lobe fiducial
 marker is not clearly visualized.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 relatively unchanged with post treatment changes noted in the left hilar
 region appearing similar.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  A moderate
 left pleural effusion has increased in size compared to the previous chest
 radiograph with associated left basilar opacity, potentially compressive
 atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.  Small right pleural effusion is
 likely present and new from the prior exams.  Minimal patchy right basilar
 opacity may reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased size of moderate left pleural effusion and new trace right
 pleural effusion compared to the prior chest radiograph.
 2. Bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect atelectasis but infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.
 3. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, slightly increased from the
 prior chest radiograph, may reflect slightly increased component of the
 pericardial effusion as seen on the previous chest CT.
 4. Post treatment changes in the left hilar region.
