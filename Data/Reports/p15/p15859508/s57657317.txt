  Increased bibasilar opacities may reflect aspiration or multifocal infection. 
  A dependent left pleural effusion is unchanged, though there is new pleural
  fluid tracking into the left major fissure and above the left apex.  In the
  trace right pleural effusion is new.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea and stage III cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ portable chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased indistinct opacities at the bilateral lung bases.  Elevation of the
 left hilum is likely related to radiation changes.  Adjacent fiducial seeds
 are unchanged in position.  A small, dependent left pleural effusion is
 essentially unchanged.  Pleural fluid tracking into the left major fissure and
 above the left apex is new.  A small right pleural effusion is likely.  Heart
 size is likely top-normal.  Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased bibasilar opacities may reflect aspiration or multifocal infection. 
 A dependent left pleural effusion is unchanged, though there is new pleural
 fluid tracking into the left major fissure and above the left apex.  The trace
 right pleural effusion is new.
