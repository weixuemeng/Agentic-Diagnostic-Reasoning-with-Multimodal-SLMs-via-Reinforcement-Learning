                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is  more fluid at the
 left base.  There is an adjacent area of relative lucency, though it is
 similar to the appearance of the lung above a thin line of opacification,
 which most likely represents a displaced fissure relating to the prior
 surgery.
 
 The right lung is essentially clear.
