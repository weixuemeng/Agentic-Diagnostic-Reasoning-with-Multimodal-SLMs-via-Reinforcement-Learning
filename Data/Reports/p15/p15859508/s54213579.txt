                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Reevaluate known left effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the chest from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Fiducial seeds in the left mid chest are unchanged.  A linear
 opacity in this region either represents atelectasis or tumor recurrence, and
 is better characterized on the recent chest CT.  No new opacity or nodule is
 identified.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Since the prior CT, a left-sided
 pleural effusion has decreased in size.  A small pleural effusion persists. 
 There is no right pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is
 stable volume loss in the right hemithorax with shift of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval decrease in size of the left pleural effusion.  A small pleural
 effusion persists.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Opacity in the left mid lung zone in the area of the fiducial seeds is
 better characterized on the recent CT and likely represents a combination of
 tumor and/or atelectasis.
