                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Wrist fracture.  Rule out pneumothorax status post chest tube
 placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 A left-sided chest tube is in place.  There is a small- to moderate-sized
 pneumothorax, seen at the apex of the lung and extending along the medial
 upper surface of the lung, with small amount of atelectasis at the left base. 
 The mediastinum remains midline.  There is slight upper zone redistribution
 and mild prominence of basilar markings, but I doubt overt CHF.  No frank
 consolidation or gross effusion.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle may be present.  Suspect background COPD.  There is mild right convex
 curvature of the thoracic spine on this semi-upright view.  Note is made of
 the fusion construct in the lower thoracic/upper lumbar spine, nominal
 alignment on these films.  Allowing for the gastric air bubble, no free air
 seen beneath the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Small-to-moderate left pneumothorax in the setting of a left chest tube.
