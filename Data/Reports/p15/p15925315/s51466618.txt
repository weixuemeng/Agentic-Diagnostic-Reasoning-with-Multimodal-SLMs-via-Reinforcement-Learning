                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison
 with prior chest radiographs through ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Tracheostomy tube is seen in situ and is in a standard position.  Both lung
 volumes are low.  Perihilar and lower lung opacity is new and is concerning
 for aspiration or asymmetric pulmonary edema considering very rapid
 development over last 24 hours.  Minimal left perihilar and lower lung
 opacities are seen but are obscured by the cardiomediastinal silhouette due to
 the rotation of patient.  Assessment of cardiomediastinal silhouette was
 limited because of low lung volumes and rotation of patient.  Right pleural
 effusion is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right perihilar and lower lung opacity which has developed over
 last 24 hours is likely from aspiration or asymmetric edema.  Pleural effusion
 is unchanged.
