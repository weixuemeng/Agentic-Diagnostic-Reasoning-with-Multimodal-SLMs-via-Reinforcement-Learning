                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 2:41
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with desaturation, question acute pulmonary
 process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies dated ___ at 1:16.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 2:54 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given marked patient rotation,
 but are likely stable.  Lungs remain low lung volumes with overall improvement
 in aeration, suggesting that interstitial edema has resolved.  Basilar patchy
 opacities are unchanged and may reflect chronic changes.  No large
 pneumothorax, although the sensitivity for detecting pneumothorax is somewhat
 diminished given supine technique.
