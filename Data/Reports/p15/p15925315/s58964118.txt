 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Tracheostomy, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 8:24 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the tracheostomy tube is in
 unchanged position.  There is improved ventilation of the lung parenchyma,
 notably at the right lung base.  The size of the cardiac silhouette continues
 to be enlarged and atelectatic opacities at both lung bases persist.  No
 pleural effusions.
