                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Complicated effusion, status post drainage.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right pigtail catheter
 has been removed.  No definite pneumothorax is appreciated.  There is
 continued opacification at the right base with obscuration of the
 hemidiaphragm.  Findings are consistent with residual effusion, some of which
 may be loculated, and volume loss.
 
 The left lung is essentially clear, and there is no vascular congestion.
