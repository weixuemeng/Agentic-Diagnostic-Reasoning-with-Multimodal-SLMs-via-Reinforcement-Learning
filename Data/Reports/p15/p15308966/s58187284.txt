                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  X-rays from ___, chest CT of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Residual small right pleural effusion has improved and is now minimal.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  New round opacity in the right middle lung is probably
 due to rounded atelectasis rather than infection.  Left lung is unremarkable. 
 Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Improvement of right pleural effusion, which is now minimal.
 2.  New focal round opacity at the right lung base is probably rounded
 atelectasis rather than infection. No further investigation is needed unless
 the patient presents infectious symptoms.
