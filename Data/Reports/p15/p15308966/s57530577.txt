                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with complicated pleural
 effusion after drainage.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right pigtail catheter is in place with slight interval increase in right
 pleural effusion which potentially may be loculated.  Left pleural effusion is
 small, unchanged.  Right basal opacity has decreased in the interim and the
 rest of the lungs except for minimal left basal atelectasis are clear.  There
 is no evidence of pneumothorax.
