                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___ and CTA chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate multiple large ovoid
 opacities projecting over right lateral and posterior basilar hemithorax,
 which most likely represent loculated pleural fluid, significantly progressed
 from ___ exams. Minor fissure is thickened, likely due to layering
 fluid.  Right paramediastinal opacity is compatible with the patient's known
 mass, better characterized on most recent CT exam.  Reticular opacities
 involving the entire right hemithorax, may represent asymmetric pulmonary
 edema on background of severe centrilobular emphysema.
 
 Left lung is clear.  There is no left pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.
 Sternotomy wires appear intact. Patient is status post CABG. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Large round opacities projecting over the right lateral and posterior
 basilar hemithorax, most likely represent loculated pleural fluid,
 significantly progressed from ___ exams.  
 2. Diffuse reticular opacities involving the right hemithorax may represent
 asymmetric pulmonary edema on the background of extensive centrilobular
 emphysema.  
 3. Right paramediastinal mass compatible with known tumor.
