                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Unresponsive.  Has fever to 102.7.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single supine AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, limiting assessment.  Within the
 limitations, there is no focal airspace opacity or pulmonary edema.  There is
 a possible small right pleural effusion.  There is no definite left pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  A pacemaker/ICD overlies the left chest with the leads overlying the
 expected location of the right atrium and the right ventricle.  Sternotomy
 wires are intact.  Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant,
 likely from a prior cholecystectomy.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated in
 comparison to the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Possible small right pleural effusion.
 2.  No focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia, though the exam is limited
 by low lung volumes.
