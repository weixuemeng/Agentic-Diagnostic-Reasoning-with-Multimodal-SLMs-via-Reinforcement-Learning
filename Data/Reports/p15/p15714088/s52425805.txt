                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pulmonary nodule seen
 on chest CT.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and CT abdomen from ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are clear.  Blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle is noted, new as compared to the prior study,
 might reflect minimal amount of pleural effusion or pleural thickening.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No nodule is demonstrated on the
 current study, but this may reflect the small size of the nodule and
 relatively low sensitivity of the chest radiograph.
