                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with substernal chest pain.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal AP upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  The
 examination is suboptimal due to poor penetration and patient body habitus. 
 Lung volumes are slightly low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  The
 lungs are grossly clear aside from mild bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no
 large effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unchanged allowing for differences in technique.  Apparent widening of the
 mediastinum is likely due to portable technique and low lung volumes. Hilar
 contours are normal.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified on this
 limited study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Limited study. No acute intrathoracic process identified.
 2.  Apparent mediastinal widening is most likely due to portable technique and
 low lung volumes.  If further evaluation is needed, conventional radiographs
 could be performed with PA and lateral views.
