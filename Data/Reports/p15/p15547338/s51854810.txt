                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with disconj gaze and rales  // acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Decreased volume of the right lung and right upper lobe scarring re-
 demonstrated.  Multiple pulmonary nodules better assessed on recent chest CT
 from ___.  Extensive hilar and mediastinal adenopathy seen on CT
 was better assessed on CT.  New since the prior study is opacity projecting
 over the left lung, centered in the left mid lung but also involving the left
 lower lung and the inferior left upper lung, worrisome for infection or
 aspiration, new/increased since 2 days prior.  More focal irregular appearing
 opacity also seen in the lateral left upper lobe, not well seen on the prior
 study, may be an additional site of infection.  Persistent blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle is seen, possibly due to trace pleural effusion. 
 There is also slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multiple pulmonary nodules, mediastinal and hilar adenopathy, better assessed
 on recent chest CT.
 
 New large area of relatively ground-glass opacity projecting over the left
 lung worrisome for infection or aspiration.  In the setting of trauma,
 pulmonary hemorrhage or not excluded.
