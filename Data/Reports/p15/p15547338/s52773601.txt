 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 1:01 AM
  No new pleural effusion, in fact, if the pleural effusion is present, it is
  very small.  Overall no significant interval change, however an approximately
  1 cm round opacity near the left costophrenic angle was not clearly seen on
  the prior exam and may be new.  Other opacities are overall unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with metastatic RCC who is feeling SOB  // e/o
 new focal opacity or pleural effusions      e/o new focal opacity or pleural
 effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent prior chest radiograph ___.  Read in
 conjunction with chest CT ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is surprisingly little change over the course of the year, if extensive
 central adenopathy and a left suprahilar mass.  Volume loss in the right upper
 lobe and vascular deficiency indicating emphysema are stable.  There are no
 areas of consolidation to suggest pneumonia or any appreciable pleural
 effusion.
 
 There may be new small pulmonary metastases.  Heart size is slightly larger
 today, reflecting pericardial effusion seen on the ___ chest CTA.  As
 such the patient is at high risk for acute or chronic pulmonary embolism,
 although there are no radiographic findings to suggest that diagnosis
 specifically.
