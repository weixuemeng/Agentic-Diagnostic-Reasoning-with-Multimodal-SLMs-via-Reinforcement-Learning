                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aspiration - rapid improvement, assess for
 pneumonitis vs pneumonia  // ? extent of pneumonia     ? extent of pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been some improvement in
 the areas of increased opacification involving much of the left lung.  This
 most likely reflects partial clearing of aspiration or infection, though
 pulmonary hemorrhage would have to be considered in the setting of trauma. 
 Decreased asymmetric pulmonary edema could also be considered, though this
 process usually occurs on the right.
 Bilateral pleural effusions are again seen, as are multiple kyphoplasties.
