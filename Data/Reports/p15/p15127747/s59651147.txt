                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pneumothorax, status post right upper lobe nodule
 bronchoscopic biopsy.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed and
 compared to the prior study.  There is no pneumothorax.  New diffuse hazy
 opacity in the right upper-to-mid lung around the area of biopsy is likely due
 to hemorrhage related to the procedure.  The heart and mediastinal contours
 are normal, and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  The
 bones and soft tissues are unremarkable.  A catheter extends from the neck
 into the abdomen and is most likely a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  Increased diffuse hazy opacity around the
 procedure area likely represents minimal hemorrhage.
