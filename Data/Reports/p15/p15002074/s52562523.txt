                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after motor vehicle collision.  Are there rib
 fractures?
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Healed fractures of posterior right middle ribs are chronic, accompanied by
 mild pleural thickening.  I see no displaced acute fractures, pneumothorax or
 appreciable pleural effusion.  The heart is normal size.  If there are focal
 findings suggesting rib or other chest cage trauma, then detailed bone views
 of those regions, clearly marked, should be obtained.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Atelectasis in the right upper lobe is new.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear.
