                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with emesis at SNF today, reportedly unwitnessed, please eval
 for aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta appearing similar.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflects atelectasis without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Marked degenerative changes of the left
 glenohumeral joint are again noted with osteophyte formation.  2 rounded
 calcific densities projecting over the right scapula may reflect loose bodies,
 unchanged from the previous chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases most likely reflects atelectasis, though
 aspiration is not completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.  No
 focal consolidation.
