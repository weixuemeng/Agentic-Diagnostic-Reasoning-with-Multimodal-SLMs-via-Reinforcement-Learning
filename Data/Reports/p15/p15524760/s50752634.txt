 There has been interval placement of an enteric tube with the tip coursing
 below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach and off the inferior borders of
 the film.  Low lung volumes remain with patchy opacities at the lung bases
 most likely reflective of atelectasis.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No pleural effusion,
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enteric tube tip in standard position.
