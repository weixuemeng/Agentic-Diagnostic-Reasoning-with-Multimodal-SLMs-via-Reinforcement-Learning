                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Bilateral nipple shadows are visualized.  The
 lung fields appear otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The chest is hyperinflated.  There is a deformity of the right
 acromioclavicular joint that is incompletely characterized but likely chronic,
 possibly post-traumatic.  Small anterior osteophytes are noted along the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Deformity of the distal right
 acromioclavicular joint and clavicle, probably chronic, but incompletely
 characterized.  Correlation with physical findings is suggested.
