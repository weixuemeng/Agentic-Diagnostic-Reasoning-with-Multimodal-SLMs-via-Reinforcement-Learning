                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with post intubation  // eval ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier today, ___ at 11:11
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating
 approximately 5.1 cm above the level the carina. Enteric tube has also been
 placed, which appears to course below the level of the diaphragm, into the
 left upper quadrant, presumably within the stomach. There is now complete
 opacification of the left hemi thorax and shift of the mediastinum to the
 left, worrisome for extensive lung collapse ; underlying consolidation or
 small pleural effusion not excluded. The right lung is clear. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are not assessed as they are shifted to the left and
 obscured by the overlying left hemi thorax opacification.
