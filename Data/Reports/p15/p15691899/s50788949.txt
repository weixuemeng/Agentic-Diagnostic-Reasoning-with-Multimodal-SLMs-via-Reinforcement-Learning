  2. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
  3. Mild bilateral juxtahilar peribronchial cuffing may reflect airway
  inflammation, such as in asthma.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:   ___M with h/o poorly controlled asthma p/w dyspnea and productive
 cough// consolidation?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiograph from ___,  lung volumes are mildly
 decreased.  There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. There
 is minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  Mild peribronchial cuffing in the bilateral
 juxtahilar regions suggest airway inflammation, which can be seen in asthma. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of pneumonia.
 2. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
 3. Mild bilateral juxtahilar peribronchial cuffing may reflect airway
 inflammation, such as in asthma.
