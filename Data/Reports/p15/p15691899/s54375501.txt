                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea  // eval for cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mildly decreased lung volumes. The patient continues to demonstrate several
 features of asthma, including peribronchial thickening and increased
 interstitial markings. However, upon review of numerous prior chest
 radiographs, there is no evidence of lung hyperexpansion at times when the
 pulmonary parenchyma appears most pathologic, mass making asthma an unlikely
 primary diagnosis. Additionally, there is an apparent focal airspace opacity
 overlying the left lower lobe. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Chronic, mild cardiomegaly. Slight differences in mediastinal contours are
 likely secondary to patient rotation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Diffusely increased interstitial markings, waxing and waning over the past
 several months chest radiographs. Given the lack of lung hyperexpansion, as
 well as well less likely. The findings may represent a recurrent toxic/
 allergic inhalation or underlying cardiac disease.
 2.  Possible superimposed left lower lobe pneumonia.
 3.  Chronic, mild cardiomegaly.
