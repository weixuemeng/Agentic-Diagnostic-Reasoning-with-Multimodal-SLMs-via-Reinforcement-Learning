 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are notable
 for a mildly tortuous thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary vascularity is not
 engorged.  The hila are within normal limits.  Lungs are grossly clear.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Please note that the lateral view is somewhat limited due to
 the patient's inability to raise her arms.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
