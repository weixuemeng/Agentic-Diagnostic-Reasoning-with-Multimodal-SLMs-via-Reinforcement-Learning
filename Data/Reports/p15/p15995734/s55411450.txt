                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of gastric cancer with no blood return from Port-A-Cath
 for chemotherapy, here to evaluate line position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left subclavian approach tunneled Port-A-Cath is not
 significantly changed in position compared to the most recent prior study with
 slightly more inferior positioning of the port projecting over the left chest
 wall and the distal tip of the Port-A-Cath terminating at the confluence of
 the left brachiocephalic vein and the SVC.  The Port-A-Cath appears intact and
 continuous throughout its length.  There has been interval development of a
 moderate left pleural effusion with associated volume loss in the left lower
 lobe from ___.  In the appropriate clinical context, a superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.  The right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable and within normal limits.  The visualized upper abdomen
 demonstrates surgical clips in the left upper quadrant likely related to prior
 surgery for gastric cancer.  Thoracic kyphosis is noted with mild degenerative
 change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No significant change in Port-A-Cath placement from ___ with tip
 terminating at the confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC.
 2.  Interval development of moderate left pleural effusion with underlying
 atelectasis or consolidation.
