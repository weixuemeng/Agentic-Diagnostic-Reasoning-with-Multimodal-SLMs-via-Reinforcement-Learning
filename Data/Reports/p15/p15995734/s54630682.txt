                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:21 P.M. ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new onset of shortness of breath, wheezing, and
 sputum production.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Large left and moderate right pleural effusions are probably a little bit
 smaller.  Patient has been extubated.  There is no longer any pulmonary edema.
 Left lower lobe is largely airless, atelectasis at the base of the right lung
 somewhat less severe, but both are relatively unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC.
 
 This examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of acute
 pulmonary embolism.
