 costophrenic angles bilaterally suggest small effusions.  There is no focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Platelike
 atelectasis is noted at the bilateral lung bases.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 identified.  Old fractures noted in the left eighth, and probably the left
 ninth ribs.
