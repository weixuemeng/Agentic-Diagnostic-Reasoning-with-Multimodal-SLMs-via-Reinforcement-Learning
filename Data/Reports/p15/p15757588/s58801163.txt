                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with resp failure  // ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 14:31
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2 cm above level the carina. 
 Recommend advancement by approximately 1 into cm for more optimal positioning.
 There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. 
 Bilateral perihilar opacities may relate to combination of pulmonary edema and
 pleural effusions.  Left base opacity may represent combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis although infection is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are similar.  Hilar
 contours are somewhat more prominent, likely related to pulmonary edema. 
 There is moderate to severe pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral perihilar
 opacities, worrisome for worsening pulmonary edema, possibly in the setting of
 CHF.
