                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with epigastric pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, MRI of lumbar spine ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has increased from the prior study.
 Dense mitral annular calcifications are present.  Aortic knob calcifications
 are re- demonstrated.  There is mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  More focal opacity in the left lower lobe may reflect
 atelectasis though infection is not excluded.  Osseous structures are
 diffusely demineralized with a wedge compression deformity of the T10
 vertebral body again noted with evidence of prior kyphoplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with mild cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary edema,
 and small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left.  Left basilar
 opacity may reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded in the
 correct clinical setting
