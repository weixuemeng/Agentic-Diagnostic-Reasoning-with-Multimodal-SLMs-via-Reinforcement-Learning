 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC line has been pulled
 back. The line now projects over the lower SVC. There is no evidence of
 complications, not notably no pneumothorax.  The patient is rotated and the
 lung volumes have decreased. Small areas of atelectasis at the left lung bases
 are constant. There is now minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus,
 potentially associated with a small left pleural effusion. No new parenchymal
 opacities. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
