                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with R subclavian CVL  // Central Line Placement.
 R/o pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right central line ends in the low SVC alongside the indwelling left
 subclavian line.  No pneumothorax, associated mediastinal widening, or
 substantial pleural effusion.  Apparent change in caliber of the mediastinum
 is attributable to rotation. ARDS ET tube in standard placement. Esophageal
 probe ends in the low esophagus esophageal drainage tube passes into the
 stomach and out of view.
 
 The appearance of consolidation at the left lung base has changed. What look
 like left lower lobe collapse now has a greater consolidation superiorly
 raising concern for pneumonia. Generalized pulmonary vascular engorgement has
 worsened, probably due to some cardiac decompensation.
 
 No pneumothorax.
