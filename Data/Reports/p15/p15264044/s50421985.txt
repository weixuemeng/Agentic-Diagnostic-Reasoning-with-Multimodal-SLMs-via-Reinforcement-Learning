                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PNA and volume overload with worsening
 respiratory distress. R/o worsening volume overload, r/o worsening parenchymal
 infiltrates.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, there is continued right upper lobe volume loss
 with increased opacification, consistent with superimposed pneumonia.  A
 left-sided pacemaker is in place. The left hemidiaphragm is obscured,
 suggesting substantial left lower lobe volume loss. There is no pneumothorax. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval increase in the right upper lobe opacification within an area of
 volume loss. Followup imaging to resolution is recommended in ___ weeks.
