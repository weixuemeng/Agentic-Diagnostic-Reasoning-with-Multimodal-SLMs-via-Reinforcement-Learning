                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pna  // eval for effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided pacemaker remains in place. A right upper lobe consolidation with
 a component of volume loss is unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 unchanged, left greater than right.  An airspace opacity at the left lung base
 may be due to infection and/or atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Right costophrenic angle opacification
 could be due to vessels or atelectasis, but the possibility of superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged right upper lobe consolidation which is most compatible with
 pneumonia.
 Stable retrocardiac airspace opacity which may be due to atelectasis or
 infection.
 Stable small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
