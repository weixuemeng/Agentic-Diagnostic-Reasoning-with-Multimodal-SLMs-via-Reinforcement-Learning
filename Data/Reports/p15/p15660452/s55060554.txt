                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath, assess for volume
 overload.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Portable AP upright radiograph of the chest was obtained.  Left greater than
 right basal parenchymal opacities are seen, which are limited in assessment
 both due to body habitus and poor penetration.  Mild edema may also be present
 but is not well assessed in the background of these parenchymal opacities. 
 The heart is stably enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left greater than right basal opacities likely reflect pneumonia
 or aspiration given appearance on subsequently obtained chest CT with
 accompanying mild pulmonary edema and effusions.
