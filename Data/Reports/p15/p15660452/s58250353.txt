                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough  // Eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 On the lateral view, middle lung opacity is seen, not well appreciated on the
 frontal view, but which could be due to underlying atelectasis or developing
 consolidation.  No focal consolidation is seen elsewhere.  Calcified right
 breast implant is noted.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity projecting over the mid lung on the lateral view, not well
 appreciated on the frontal view may represent atelectasis, but developing
 consolidation due to pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
