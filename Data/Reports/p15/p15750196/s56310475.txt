                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with respiratory distress
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms. Heart size is
 normal. Aortic knob calcifications are present. Mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable. There is mild perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness
 compatible with mild pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  7 mm nodular opacity within the left apex
 appears new in the interval.  Hypertrophic changes are demonstrated within the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.
 7 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left apex, not clearly demonstrated
 on the previous exams. This can be further assessed with a chest CT on a
 nonemergent basis.
