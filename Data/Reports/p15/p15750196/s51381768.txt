                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild to moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette, unchanged.  The
 aorta demonstrates calcified atherosclerotic disease and remains tortuous. 
 There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution, similar to the previous
 study compatible with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is visualized.  Blunting of the costophrenic
 angles posteriorly on the lateral view is possibly reflective of trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with possible trace bilateral pleural
 effusions.
