  New striated lucencies along the supraclavicular soft tissues and along spine
  and posterior soft tissues is worrisome for subcutaneous emphysema and
  necrotizing fasciitis.  Clinical correlation is recommended as finding may be
  artifact and external to patient.  Recommend repeat chest radiograph without
  overlying material.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain.  Assess etiology for chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to ___ study there are new striated lucencies along
 the supraclavicular soft tissues on frontal projection as well as along the
 spine and posterior soft tissues on lateral projection.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and clear.  Stable scarring of the right
 costophrenic angle.  No left pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size,
 mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No findings to account for chest pain.
 
 
 2.  Linear lucencies in the supraclavicular soft tissues are very likely due
 to superimposition of structures external to the patient but could be
 confirmed with repeat radiograph if warranted clinically.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 4:37 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
