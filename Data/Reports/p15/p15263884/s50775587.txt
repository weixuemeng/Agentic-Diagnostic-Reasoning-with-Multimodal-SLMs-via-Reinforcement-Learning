 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:00 AM
  1. Interval decrease in striated lucencies projecting along the soft tissues
  of the supraclavicular region.  Findings are consistent with artifact rather
  than subcutaneous emphysema.
  
  2. No pneumonia.
  
  3.  Stable trace right pleural effusion.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 5:21 AM
  1. Interval decrease in striated lucencies projecting along the soft tissues
  of the supraclavicular region suggesting artifact.  The paraspinal soft
  tissues were not assessed on this portable radiograph.  If clinical concern a
  CT would be diagnostic.
  
  2. No pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with abnl findings on CXR, ? artifcact.  Assess for PNA,
 reconfirm findings
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to prior chest radiograph striated lucencies along
 supraclavicular region have decreased consistent with reduction of artifact
 from overlying external structures to the patient.  .
 
 The lungs are well-expanded and clear.  Persistent right lateral costophrenic
 angle blunting.  Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Previously reported soft tissue findings were secondary to structures
 external to the patient.
 
 2. No pneumonia.
 
 3.  Lateral blunting of right costophrenic sulcus, which may reflect pleural
 thickening or small effusion.  .
