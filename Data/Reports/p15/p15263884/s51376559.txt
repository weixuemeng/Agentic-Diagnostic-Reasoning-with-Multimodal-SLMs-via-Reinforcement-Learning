 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p chest tube  // f/u ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A right pigtail pleural drainage catheter now projects over the right lower
 chest. There may have been some decrease in multiloculated right pleural
 effusion, but at the very least, conventional chest radiographs should be
 obtained because the lateral view is a much better way to assess the status of
 posterior loculations.
