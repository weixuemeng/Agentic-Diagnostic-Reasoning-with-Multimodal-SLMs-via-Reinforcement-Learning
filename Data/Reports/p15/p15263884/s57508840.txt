                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with complicated medical history of paraplegia
 and chronic indwelling Foley, recurrent MDR UTIs, hx Gallbladder fossa
 abscess, type 2 DM, HTN, CAD, DVT s/p left AKA, now with resp failure  // eval
 for pna vs CHF
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 22:22
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 Probable background hyperinflation, suggesting COPD.  Allowing for this, there
 is moderate cardiomegaly, similar to the prior study.  The hila are prominent,
 with a tapered appearance, which could reflect pulmonary hypertension.  Hazy
 opacities seen at both lung bases, likely reflecting bilateral pleural
 effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and vascular plethora, suggesting mild CHF.  Surgical clips
 noted in the right upper abdomen.
 
 Compared with the prior film, the right PICC line has been removed.  There is
 a thin linear density overlying the coursing horizontally over the upper
 chest.  The appearance is not typical for a PICC line or other catheter and
 this could lie outside the the patient.  Clinical correlation is requested.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Suspect background COPD.
 2. Moderate cardiomegaly, probably unchanged.  Enlarged pulmonary hila raise
 the possibility of pulmonary hypertension.
 3. Upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora, consistent with CHF.
 4. Probable small left-greater-than-right effusions, with likely underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation.  In the setting, pneumonic infiltrate would be
 difficult to exclude.
 5. Linear density coursing over upper chest, question outside the the patient.
 Clinical correlation requested.
