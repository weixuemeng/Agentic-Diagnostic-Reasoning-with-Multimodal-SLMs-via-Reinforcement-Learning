 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute hypoxia s/p intubation, NSEMI and
 likely CHF  // Intubation, volume overload?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to the previous radiograph from 1 day earlier, there has been slight
 improved aeration in the right mid and lower lung, with no other relevant
 change.  Apparent coiling of nasogastric tube in the cervical area could be
 external or internally coiled.  Correlation with physical exam in this region
 is suggested.
