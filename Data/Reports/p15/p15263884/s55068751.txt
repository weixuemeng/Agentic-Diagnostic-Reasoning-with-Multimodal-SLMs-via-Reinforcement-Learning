                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubated hypoxic resp failure  // pna     
 pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are stable.  Again there is hazy opacification at the bases obscuring
 the hemidiaphragms, more prominent on the left, consistent with layering
 pleural effusions and compressive basilar atelectasis.  There is mild
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, which could be a manifestation of mild
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
 In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would be very
 difficult to exclude, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
