  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
  Increased soft tissue density at the upper right aspect of the mediastinum. 
  This is unchanged compared to multiple priors but is incompletely
  characterized.  Differential considerations include right-sided thyroid
  enlargement, although there is no deviation of the trachea to the left, or
  toward tortuosity of the great vessels.  Underlying mass lesion or adenopathy
  would also be possible.  Additional imaging can be performed as clinically
  warranted.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with chest pressure, vomiting  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior plain films of the chest dating back to ___ with
 most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  Nipple shadow projects over
 the left lung base.  There is no edema or effusion.  Incidentally noted is an
 azygos fissure.  In addition to that, there is increased soft tissue density
 in the right right upper mediastinum without clear delineation of the
 peritracheal stripe.  This appearance is similar compared to the multiple
 priors.  There is increased There is tortuosity of the descending thoracic
 aorta.
