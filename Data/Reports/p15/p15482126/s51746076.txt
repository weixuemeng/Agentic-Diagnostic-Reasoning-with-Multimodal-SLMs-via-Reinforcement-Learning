                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of pneumonia, now asymptomatic, evaluation for
 resolution.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The recent radiographs documenting the pneumonia are not available
 for comparison.  There is a moderate hiatal hernia and moderate tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.  Mild cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 On the lateral image, better than on the frontal one, a small peribronchial
 opacity is seen, located at the right medial lung base.  This change could
 reflect the healing pneumonia.  No evidence of recent infection.  Normal hilar
 and mediastinal structures.  No pleural effusions.
