                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension, now
 with substernal chest pain.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Either in spite of, or because of, low lung volumes, the heart size
 appears top normal, and there appears to be cephalic redistribution of
 pulmonary vasculature.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unremarkable.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with possible early heart failure.
