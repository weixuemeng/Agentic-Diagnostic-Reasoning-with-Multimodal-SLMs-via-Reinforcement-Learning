                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with status post exploratory laparotomy lysis
 of adhesions, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright frontal portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___ and
 CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New extensive opacification of bilateral lung fields is most consistent with
 severe pulmonary edema.  Areas of nodularity in the left upper lung and right
 lung base may represent a superimposed infectious process or large pulmonary
 nodules, as seen on recent abdomen pelvis CT.  Repeat chest radiographs or
 chest CT following diuresis are recommended for further evaluation.
 
 Numerous support devices include an enteric tube terminating within the
 stomach, a prostatic mitral valve, 8 intact median sternotomy wires, and
 multiple mediastinal clips.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe pulmonary edema.  Considering the nodular quality have some of the
 opacities, short-term followup radiographs would be helpful to contents insure
 resolution and to exclude the possibility of coexisting infection, vasculitis,
 or neoplasm.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Followup chest radiographs or chest CT following diuresis
 are recommended to evaluate for resolution of areas of nodularity.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 9:54 AM, 1 minutes after
