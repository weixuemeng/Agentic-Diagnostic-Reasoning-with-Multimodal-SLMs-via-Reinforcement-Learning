                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory distress/pulmonary edema s/p
 diuresis. Please xray at 14:00, evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Previously seen severe pulmonary edema is now moderate with persistent areas
 of more focal opacity in the left upper lung and right lower lung also
 decreased in density.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  An enteric tube coils within the
 stomach.  Mitral valve prosthesis is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement in now moderate bilateral pulmonary edema.
 2. More focal areas of opacity bilaterally are less dense suggesting pulmonary
 edema is the underlying etiology.  Continued radiographic follow-up to
 resolution is recommended.
