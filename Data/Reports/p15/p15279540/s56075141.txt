  A left PICC ends in the mid SVC.  Patient is status post median sternotomy,
  mitral and tricuspid valve replacement.  Median sternotomy wires are intact. 
  Small right pleural effusion is mildly increased.  Atelectasis at the right
  lung base is unchanged.  Opacification of the left lung base likely secondary
  to a small pleural effusion and left lung base atelectasis, unchanged from ___.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  No pneumothorax.
