                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with shortness of breath. Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded with near complete resolution of right lower lobe
 opacity. New linear platelike opacities within the right lower and left lower
 lobe are most consistent with atelectasis and only seen on frontal projection.
 No additional focal opacity. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size,
 mediastinal contour, and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No good explanation for patient's symptoms.
 2.  Near-complete resolution of right lower lobe opacity.
 3.  Linear platelike opacities within bilateral lower lobes is most consistent
 with atelectasis. Clinical correlation recommended to assess for superimposed
 infection.
