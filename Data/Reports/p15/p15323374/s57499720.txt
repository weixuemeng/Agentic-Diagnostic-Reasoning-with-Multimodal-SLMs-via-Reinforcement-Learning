                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Elevated WBC, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Surgical clips in
 the lower neck likely reflect prior thyroid surgery.  There is mild elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm.  The lungs appear clear without signs of pneumonia
 or CHF.  No effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size appears normal.  There is
 prominence of the right paratracheal stripe.  The bony structures appear
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Widened mediastinum, which could reflect mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy or prominent mesiastinal fat/vessels.  A dedicated chest CT
 may be obtained to further assess.
