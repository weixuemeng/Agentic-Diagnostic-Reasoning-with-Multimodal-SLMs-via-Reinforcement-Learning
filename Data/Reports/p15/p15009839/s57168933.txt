 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding in the bronchovascular
 structures.  Additionally, a patchy opacity is noted within the right lower
 lobe.  This is nonspecific and could reflect atelectasis though infection is
 not excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
