                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with non-small cell lung cancer, status post
 inguinal biopsy, with shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study PET-CT ___.
 
 Deviation of the cardiomediastinum towards the right side, cardiomegaly,
 tortuous aorta, enlarged pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary
 hypertension and mediastinal widening due to mediastinal lymph nodes are
 unchanged.  Allowing the difference in technique, small-to-moderate right
 pleural effusion associated with right lower lobe atelectasis and known right
 lower lobe mass are probably unchanged.  Mild vascular congestion is new. 
 Reticulonodular opacities in the left peribronchial region and left lower lobe
 are worrisome for lymphangitic spread of the tumor.  Followup after diuresis
 is recommended to assess residual abnormality.
