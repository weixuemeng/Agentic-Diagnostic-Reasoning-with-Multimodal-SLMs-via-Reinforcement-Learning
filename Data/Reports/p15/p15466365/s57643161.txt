                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest heaviness and dyspnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There is linear
 opacity at the right lung apex.  There is also superior retration of the right
 hilum.  Overall, findings are suggestive of scarring.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear without evidence of consolidation or effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 essentially unremarkable. There is a well-corticated contour irregularity of
 the anterior, superior aspect of the right second rib, potentially related to
 prior trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
