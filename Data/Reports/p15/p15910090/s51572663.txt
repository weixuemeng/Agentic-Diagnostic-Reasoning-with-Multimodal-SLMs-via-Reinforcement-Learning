 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess for pneumothorax, transbronchial biopsy.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier.
 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  There are increasing atelectases in the right lower lobe. 
 Mass-like opacity in the left perihilar region and linear opacities in the
 left upper lobe are again noted.
