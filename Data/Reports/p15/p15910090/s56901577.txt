                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lung cancer, worsening cough and pleural
 effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Left pleural catheter has been removed.  There is persistently increased
 opacity in the left mid to low lung, with obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm and left heart border, likely reflecting a combination of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis related to the known spiculated mass in this
 region. The spiculated mass that was previously characterized on CT is not
 well seen in this radiograph study. In the appropriate clinical setting,
 superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. The right lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable left mid-lower lung opacity, likely combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis related unknown spiculated lung mass. However, superimposed
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
