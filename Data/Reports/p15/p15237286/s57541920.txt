                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p left thoracentesis  // eval for effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, allowing for differences
 in technique, left-sided moderate pleural effusion has reaccumulated, though
 not to the extent seen on pre thoracentesis radiographs water ___.  Tiny right pleural effusion persist.  Lingular opacity appears more
 confluent and is concerning for early developing consolidation.  Retrocardiac
 opacity has worsened and likely reflects atelectasis, though infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.  The right lung is clear.  Heart size, which
 difficult to assess the setting of effusion, is likely moderately enlarged and
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Reaccumulated left pleural effusion, now moderate, abdomen but still
 smaller in size than demonstrated on the prethoracentesis radiographs from ___
 ___. New confluent left mid lung opacity, which could potentially represent an
 early focus of pneumonia.  Worsening retrocardiac opacity likely reflects
 atelectasis, though aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.
 3. Persistent tiny right pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
