                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Increase leukocytosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged allowing for
 differences in technique. Asymmetric opacities are greater on the left than
 right and probably increased somewhat concerning for pneumonia. Accompanying
 venous pulmonary venous hypertension or very mild congestion is also suspected
 but less striking.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague opacities, most confluent in the left lower lung, suggestive of
 pneumonia. Short-term follow-up with standard PA and lateral radiographs may
 be helpful to reassess if feasible.
