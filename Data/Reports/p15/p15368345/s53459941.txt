                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxemia  // eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___:22.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously air-filled loops of bowel in the large hiatus hernia now
 fluid-filled, but I do not believe the hernia has been reduced to any
 significant degree.  There is considerable atelectasis in the left lower lobe
 due to mass effect by the intrathoracic bowel lobes, probably the cause of the
 hypoxia. There is no pulmonary edema. Heart size obscured by the hernia is
 indeterminate.
