 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of positive PPD, check for abnormalities.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of status
 after right thoracoplasty.  Bilateral apical fibrotic lung changes, associated
 with pleural thickening on the right, suggestive of previous tuberculous
 disease.  Signs of volume loss in the right upper lobe.  No new parenchymal
 opacities.  Moderate cardiomegaly but no evidence of pulmonary edema or
 pleural effusions.  No evidence of recent tuberculosis.
