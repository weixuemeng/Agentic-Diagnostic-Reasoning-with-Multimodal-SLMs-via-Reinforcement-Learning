                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient before dialysis with
 screening with history of lobectomy for tuberculosis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The patient is after prior right thoracoplasty due to known history of
 tuberculosis.  There are no interval changes compared to the prior study with
 no evidence of active tuberculosis.  Scarring at the right lower lobe as well
 as in the left apex is re-demonstrated, unchanged.  Enlargement of the right
 pulmonary artery is most likely due to pulmonary hypertension. Cardiomegaly is
 moderate and unchanged.
