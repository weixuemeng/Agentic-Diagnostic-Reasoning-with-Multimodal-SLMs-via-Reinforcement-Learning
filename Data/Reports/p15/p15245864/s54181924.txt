                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is subtle increased opacity
 within the left lung base compared to prior examination, raising concern for
 the development of aspiration or pneumonia.  Subsegmental atelectasis is
 likely at the right lung base.  The patient is rotated making evaluation of
 mediastinal structures difficult.  However, cardiac contours appear similar to
 prior.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal increased opacity within the left lung base possibly due to
 aspiration or early pneumonia.  Follow up radiographs may be helpful if
 warranted clinically.
