                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from approximately 8 hours prior on the same
 day, as well as ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, allowing for technique.  The lungs are fairly well-aerated, with
 bilateral infrahilar opacities, which could represent multifocal pneumonia. 
 The right infrahilar opacity is increased compared to the chest radiograph
 from earlier on the same day.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased bilateral infrahilar opacities, which again could represent
 multifocal pneumonia.
