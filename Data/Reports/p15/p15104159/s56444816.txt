                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fever. Question pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is borderline in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Vague
 opacification of the left mid to lower lung spares the left cardiac border,
 which appear sharp; although the opacities are not well seen on the lateral
 view, it is probably in the left lower lobe. Although the density is not very
 elevated, the extent of the abnormality may be significant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest pneumonia in the left lung, probably in the left lower lobe.
 Follow-up radiographs are suggested to show resolution within ___ weeks.
