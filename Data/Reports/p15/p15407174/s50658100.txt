                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // eval for pleural effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left.  Airspace opacity
 at the left lung base may reflect a degree of atelectasis however this seems
 relatively extensive compared to the size of the effusion and infection cannot
 be excluded.  The right lung appears grossly clear, linear atelectasis or
 scarring in the right mid lung.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left.  Left basal consolidation may
 reflect atelectasis or pneumonia.
