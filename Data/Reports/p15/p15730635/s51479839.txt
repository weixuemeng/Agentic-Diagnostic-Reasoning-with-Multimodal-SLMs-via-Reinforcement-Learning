  Diffuse, extensive bilateral airspace opacities are seen. A more nodular focus
  in the left lung base is also noted. These findings could represent multifocal
  pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage or sequela malignancy given the nodular
  opacity in the left lung base.  Correlation with clinical history is
  recommended. If no clinical history is available the CT is recommended for
  further evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with resp distress  // confirm airway
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities worse in the left midlung are extensive. 
 A nodular opacity at the left lung base is concerning for a pulmonary nodule. 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  A cardiac conduction device is contiguous with
 leads which end in the right ventricle, through the coronary sinus and
 probably right atrium.  A right PICC ends in the mid SVC.  An endotracheal
 tube ends in the mid thoracic trachea.  The distal tip of an enteric tube is
 not definitively visualized but likely courses below the level of the
 diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse, extensive bilateral airspace opacities are seen.  A more nodular
 focus in the left lung base is also noted.  These findings could represent
 multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage or sequelae of malignancy given the
 nodular opacity in the left lung base.  Correlation with clinical history is
 recommended.  If no clinical history is available CT is recommended for
 further evaluation.
