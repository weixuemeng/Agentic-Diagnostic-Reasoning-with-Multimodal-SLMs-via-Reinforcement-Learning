                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Pigtail pleural catheter remains in place in the left hemithorax. 
 A very large left pneumothorax is present, and has increased in size since the
 prior study.  The apical visceral pleural line is at the level of the inferior
 aspect of the left fifth posterior rib.  Due to slight rightward patient
 rotation, it is difficult to assess for signs of tension, but note is made of
 slight widening of the rib interspaces on the left, which could indicate the
 presence of tension.  Small loculated hydropneumothorax components are also
 visualized, best seen on the lateral radiograph.  Left basilar atelectasis is
 present.  Right lung and pleural surfaces are clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing, large left pneumothorax with possible tension.  This
 finding has been communicated by telephone with Dr. ___ at 9:25 a.m. on
 ___ at the time of discovery.
