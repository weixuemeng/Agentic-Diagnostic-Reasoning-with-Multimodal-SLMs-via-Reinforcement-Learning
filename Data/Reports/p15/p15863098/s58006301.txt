                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post pigtail catheter placement for tension pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:39 Pm.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided chest tube is seen with pigtail projecting over the left lower lung
 field.  A residual small to moderate sized left-sided pneumothorax is present,
 with resolution of the previously seen signs of tension.  The left lung has
 re-expanded, with streaky left basilar opacities possibly reflecting residual
 atelectasis.  Right lung is clear.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar
 contours are normal is size and location, with resolution of the previously
 seen rightward shift.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Status post placement of left-sided pigtail chest tube with interval
 re-expansion of the left lung, residual small to moderate  left-sided
 pneumothorax, and resolution of the previously noted signs of tension.
