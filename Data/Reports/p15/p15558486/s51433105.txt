                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky opacity
 suggests atelectasis associated with a mild to moderate hiatal hernia, but
 otherwise the lung fields appear clear.  Moderate anterior osteophytes are
 again present along several lower thoracic levels.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Mild to moderate hiatal hernia.
