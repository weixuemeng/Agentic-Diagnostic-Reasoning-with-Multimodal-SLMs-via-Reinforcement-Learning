 eval for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again evidence of a right
 hilar mass with chronic collapse of the right middle lobe. There is some
 opacification in the retrocardiac region, slightly more prominent than on the
 previous study, though this is not definitely noted on the frontal view. In
 the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent a developing
 consolidation.
