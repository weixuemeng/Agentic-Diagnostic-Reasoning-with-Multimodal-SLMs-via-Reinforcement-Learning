                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with sarcoid and cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___, chest CT ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate similarly
 adequate lung volumes from ___.  There has been interval increase in
 thickening along the major fissure, which is further displaced inferiorly, the
 result of increasing chronic volume loss.  A region of rounded atelectasis in
 the left lower lung is also unchanged.  Numerous bilateral tiny nodules are
 better appreciated on comparison CT.  There is no new focal consolidation,
 though airspace opacity and volume loss in the left upper lobe is increased. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and the pulmonary arteries are
 increasingly prominent from prior.  Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy is
 better appreciated on the comparison CT.  
 
 Wedge deformities of lower thoracic vertebral bodies have not significantly
 progressed from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight interval increase in airspace opacity emanating from the hila
 bilaterally, with unchanged micronodular pattern of pulmonary parenchymal
 opacification.  Increasing inferior displacement of the major fissure is
 concerning for bronchial obstruction which could be due to airway changes of
 sarcoid however further evaluation with contrast enhanced CT is recommended to
 exclude an obstructive mass.
 
 2.  Increase in prominence of the pulmonary arteries, suggesting increasing
 pulmonary hypertension.
 
 Findings and recommendations were entered into the web based radiology results
 reporting tool for clinician notification.
