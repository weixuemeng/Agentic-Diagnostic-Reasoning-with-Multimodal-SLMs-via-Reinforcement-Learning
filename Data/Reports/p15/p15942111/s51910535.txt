                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, history of sarcoidosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest provided. Again seen, are
 bilateral prominent hilar opacities and radiating streaky opacities, which is
 similar compared to prior study and consistent with known sarcoidosis. A
 superimposed subtle pneumonia is difficult to exclude in the correct clinical
 setting.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  There is mild stable
 cardiomegaly.
