 The right Port-A-Cath remains in place.  There is persistent right-sided
 opacity related to a known right hilar mass resulting in a chronically
 collapsed right middle lobe.  There is stable blunting of both costophrenic
 angles which may represent chronic pleural thickening or small effusions. No
 evidence of pulmonary edema or new airspace consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia. No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.
