                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with intoxication, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is somewhat limited by patient rotation and incomplete coverage of
 the right costophrenic angle.  Heart size appears grossly within normal
 limits.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs appear grossly clear without focal
 consolidation.  No large left-sided pleural effusion is identified.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to patient rotation and exclusion of the right costophrenic
 angle.  Otherwise, no gross acute cardiopulmonary process.
