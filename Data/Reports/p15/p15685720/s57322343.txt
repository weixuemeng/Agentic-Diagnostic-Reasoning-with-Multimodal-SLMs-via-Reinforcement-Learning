                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with right pleural effusion
 after right thoracocentesis.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to CT abdomen from
 ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged but it might be attributed to the portable character of
 the study.  There is small amount of right pleural effusion as well as right
 basal consolidation that potentially reflect areas of re-expanding
 atelectasis.  Opacities in the right lower chest might be due to pleural
 masses as seen on the CT abdomen from ___.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Nodular opacity in the left upper lung is demonstrated and most likely
 reflects pulmonary nodule as well as additional nodules in the right mid lung.
