                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 15:25
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right VATS wedge resection.  Evaluate
 for pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 14:58.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 15:30 p.m. was submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the right chest tube with no evidence of pneumothorax.
 There are stable postoperative changes in the right upper lung.  The multiple
 lung nodules seen on CT ___ are not well appreciated on plain
 radiography.  A more focal linear opacity at the left base likely reflects
 subsegmental atelectasis.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stably enlarged.  No large pleural effusions.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
