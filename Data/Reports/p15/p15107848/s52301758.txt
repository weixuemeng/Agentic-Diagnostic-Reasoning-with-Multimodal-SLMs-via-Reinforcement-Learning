 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient has underlying chronic interstitial lung disease. However, compared to
 chest radiograph from ___, there has been significant interval
 increase in bilateral pulmonary opacities as well as obscuration of the

 effusions with overlying atelectasis, subtle suggestion of bibasilar air
 bronchograms raises concern for bilateral consolidations which may be due to
 infection and/ or aspiration. Underlying pulmonary edema may also be present.
