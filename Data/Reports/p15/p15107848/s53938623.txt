 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with IPF, distolic dysfunction, now with
 worsening SOB,  // ? worsening infiltrate, fluid
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 All support devices have been removed.  Extensive bilateral airspace opacities
 have minimally improved since the study of 3 days prior, particularly in the
 left upper lobe.  However, the background of fine reticular interstitial
 opacities is unchanged. Lung volumes remain low. There is no pneumothorax. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged.  Small pleural
 effusions are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly improved aeration of the left upper lobe, which may be due to
