                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Confirm line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is been placement of a right internal jugular central line that
 terminates in the right atrium. Endotracheal tube, a nasogastric tube are
 unchanged and appropriately positioned.  Compared to the prior study there is
 improved aeration and improvement in bilateral pulmonary opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right internal jugular central line in the right atrium which should be
 retracted for more optimal positioning in the SVC.
 2. Improved bilateral pulmonary opacities favoring pulmonary edema as the
 etiology.
