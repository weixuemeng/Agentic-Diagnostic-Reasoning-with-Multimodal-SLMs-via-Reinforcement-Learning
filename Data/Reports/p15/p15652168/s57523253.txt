                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and metastatic adenocarcinoma of
 unknown origin, admitted with severe hydronephrosis and acute renal failure
 with new cough, please evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unchanged prominent
 reticular interstitial pattern with areas of lucency consistent with history
 of known fibrosis.  Given lung tissue abnormalities, assessment for subtle
 focal opacities is difficult; however, there appears to be increased
 opacification obscuring the left heart border which could reflect a developing
 infectious process versus acute exacerbation.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 Otherwise, the mediastinal, hilar, and cardiac contours are unremarkable.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath is
 identified with tip in the distal superior vena cava.  Degenerative changes
 are noted at the right acromioclavicular junction.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Slightly increased focal opacity in the lingula may signify new
 infectious process versus acute exacerbation of known IPF.
