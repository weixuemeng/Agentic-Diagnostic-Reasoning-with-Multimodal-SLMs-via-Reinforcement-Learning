                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with pulmonary fibrosis and masses, now with
 pain and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Reticular interstitial pattern of opacification with areas of
 lucency appears similar compared to prior and is consistent with known
 pulmonary fibrosis.  Subtle focal opacities may be obscured by this underlying
 process.  There is no evidence for new large focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable with a
 calcified tortuous aorta.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath is in similar position. 
 Degenerative changes noted at the acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Underlying pulmonary fibrosis without radiographically apparent
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
