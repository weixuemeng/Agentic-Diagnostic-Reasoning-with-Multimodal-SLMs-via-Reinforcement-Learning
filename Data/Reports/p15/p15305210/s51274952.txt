                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p mv ring  // eval for effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular vein
 catheter has been removed. The lung volumes have increased, reflecting
 improved ventilation and a platelike atelectasis on the left is smaller than
 before. However, atelectasis notably at the left lung bases persist and
 moderate cardiomegaly with signs of mild fluid overload is still present.  No
 pneumonia, no pneumothorax.
