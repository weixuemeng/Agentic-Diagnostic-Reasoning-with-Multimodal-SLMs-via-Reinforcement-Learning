 FINDINGS:  Interval removal of endotracheal tube, Swan-Ganz catheter and
 nasogastric tube.  Placement of right internal jugular central venous catheter
 with tip in the lower superior vena cava.  No visible pneumothorax.  Worsening
 consolidation in the left mid lung region obscures the left heart border,
 limiting overall assessment of heart size.  Mild pulmonary edema is again
 demonstrated.  Interval improved opacity at right lung base, but persistent
 dense left retrocardiac atelectasis or consolidation accompanied by a moderate
 left pleural effusion.  No visible pneumothorax.
