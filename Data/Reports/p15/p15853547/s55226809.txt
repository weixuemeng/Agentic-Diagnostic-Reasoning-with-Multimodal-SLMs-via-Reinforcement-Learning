                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, rule out pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal portable chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe could represent
 atelectasis, though aspiration or infection cannot be fully excluded.  Linear
 bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis.  There is no evidence of
 pleural effusion, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged, and median sternotomy wires are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left retrocardiac opacity could represent atelectasis, though
 aspiration or infection is not fully excluded.
