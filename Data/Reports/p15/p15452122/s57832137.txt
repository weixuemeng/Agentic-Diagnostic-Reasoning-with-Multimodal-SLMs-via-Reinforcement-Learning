                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal
 limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Slight elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm compared to the right may reflect volume loss. 
 Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Mild rightward convex curvature is
 centered along the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
