 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Perforated bowel, evaluation for endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 11:14 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the
 endotracheal tube is not substantially changed.  The tube projects 5 cm above
 the carina.  Also unchanged is the course of the nasogastric tube, the
 position of the right subclavian vein catheter.
 
 The patient continues to display bilateral pleural effusions and areas of
 bilateral basal atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary edema might also be present. 
 However, there is no evidence for a newly occurred parenchymal opacity
 suggesting pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
