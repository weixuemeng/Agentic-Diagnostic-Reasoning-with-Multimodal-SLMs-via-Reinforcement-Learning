 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx of influenza PNA  // assess for
 consolidation      assess for consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette, though the degree of pulmonary edema has substantially
 decreased.  Retrocardiac opacification with poor definition of the
 hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and
 pleural effusion.  Nevertheless, in especially in the absence of a lateral
 view, it would be very difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
