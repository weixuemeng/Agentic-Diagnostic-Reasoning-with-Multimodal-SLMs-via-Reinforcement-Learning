                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with inferior STEMI.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 20:20.
 
 SINGLE PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  In comparison to the prior exam, there
 is no significant change.  Heart is mildly enlarged.  Lung volumes are again
 low.  There is no overt sign of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  An opacity in the right middle lobe which
 silhouettes the heart border and may represent pneumonia in the correct
 clinical setting, however it is likely atelectasis given the low lung volumes.
 A new right IJ line terminates in the high SVC.
