                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fall, please eval for traumatic injuries
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right
 atrium.  Heart size is normal.  The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous.
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Low lung volumes are present with
 crowding of bronchovascular structures.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  Spiculated opacity in the right upper
 lobe correlates to the spiculated lesion seen on previous chest CT.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There is mild
 diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures without acutely displaced
 fracture noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  Re- demonstration of spiculated
 opacity in the right upper lobe, better assessed on recent chest CT.
