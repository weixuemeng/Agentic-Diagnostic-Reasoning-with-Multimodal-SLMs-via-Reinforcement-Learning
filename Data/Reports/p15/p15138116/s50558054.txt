 PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The edge of the lung parenchyma is seen in the right apex consistent with a
 slight interval increase in size of the right apical pneumothorax.  However,
 the horizontal fissure appears to extend all the way to the pleural surface
 and lung markings are seen extending to the apex.  The appearances suggest
 this may be a small loculated pneumothorax.
 
 Otherwise, the 2 right upper lobe mass like areas are unchanged with 2
 fiducials in-situ.  Calcified breast prostheses again noted.  The left lung
 appears clear.  .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval increase in the right apical pneumothorax.  The appearances
 are suspicious for a loculated pneumothorax.  A subsequent chest radiograph
 obtained at 12 noon demonstrates a decrease in size of the pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by telephone at 13:11 on
