 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post lung biopsy, questionable pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Preoperative chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous image, there is unchanged evidence of
 extensive bilateral predominantly peripheral fibrotic disease.  After biopsy,
 a rounded opacity is new in the right upper lobe bases and likely to
 correspond to a small post-biopsy hematoma.  There is no evidence of
 complications, notably no pneumothorax.
 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, pleural effusions.
