                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a history of stage IV Mullerian carcinoma
 status post resection of a groin mass, now with differential upper extremity
 systolic blood pressures.  Evaluate for evidence of mediastinal widening.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium.  Heart size is normal. 
 Slight interval widening of the mediastinum may be accentuated by non-upright
 positioning and may reflect increased intravascular volume with mild
 distension of the mediastinal veins.  The aortic knob contour is unchanged. 
 Lungs are clear.  Pleural surfaces are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild, interval widening of the mediastinum may reflect mediastinal venous
 distension.  Aortic dissection cannot be excluded radiographically, so if
 clinical concern for dissection exists, CTA chest is recommended for further
 evaluation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider CT chest for further evaluation, if clinical
 concern for aortic dissection exists.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings and recommendation were discussed with Dr. ___
 by Dr. ___ on the telephone on ___ at 3:00 PM, 5 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
