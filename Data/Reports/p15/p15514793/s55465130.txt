 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac silhouette size appears mild to moderately
 enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy and linear opacities are noted in the
 lung bases.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  No acute osseous abnormality is present.  Gaseous distention of
 colonic loops of bowel are seen in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.

 Bibasilar patchy and linear opacities may reflect areas of atelectasis though
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
