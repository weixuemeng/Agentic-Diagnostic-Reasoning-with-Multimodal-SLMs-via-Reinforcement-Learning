                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___M with pna  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  When compared to the prior, there has been interval progression
 of disease.  More confluent consolidation is identified at the right lung
 base, some of this density may be accounted for by increased pleural fluid
 although underlying parenchymal opacity has also appear to progressed. 
 Streaky left basilar opacity is likely atelectasis.  Cardiac silhouette is
 difficult to assess.  No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Progression of disease at the right lung base likely due to effusion with
 underlying consolidation, potentially pneumonia.  Followup after treatment
 will be necessary to exclude underlying mass lesion.
