                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bibasilar consolidations seen on both the
 frontal and lateral views are concerning for multifocal pneumonia versus
 aspiration. Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: Bibasilar consolidations consistent with multifocal pneumonia
 versus aspiration. Pulmonary embolism is considered less likely given
 bilaterality of the findings.
