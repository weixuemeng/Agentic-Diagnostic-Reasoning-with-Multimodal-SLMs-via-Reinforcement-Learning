                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON EXAM:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, ___.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs are
 well expanded and clear. Pectus carinatum accounts for the appearance of a
 large perceived retrosternal airspace on the lateral film, and this should not
 be interpreted as a sign of hyperinflation.  There is no pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema.
