                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and previous upper lobe nodular disease.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ as well as more recent chest
 CT dated ___, performed shortly before this examination.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A substantial right perihilar nodule has substantially improved
 since the prior radiographs with an area of cavitation seen in lieu of a
 substantial solid nodule.  Other nodules also appear somewhat less distinct
 including a cavitating nodule in the right upper lobe which seems surrounded
 perhaps by slightly less opacity than before.  There are no pleural effusions
 or pneumothorax.  Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are similar throughout
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Smaller lung nodules since the prior radiographs with increased
 cavitation.
