                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with restrictive/obstructive lung disease and
 dyspnea, clinical concern for pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable with mild cardiomegaly.  Aortic and mitral valve prostheses are
 noted.  In comparison to the earlier chest CT of ___, diffuse extensive
 heterogeneous opacification in both lungs are new. Confluent right apical
 opacity, likely represents a  right upper lobe peripheral consolidation.  Left
 apical pleural thickening is unchanged. No effusions or septal thickening to
 suggest pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: Diffuse multifocal pulmonary opacities with right upper lobe
 consolidation, is atypical for pulmonary edema.  If followup chest radiograph
 in two days does not show significant improvement, chest CT is recommended for
 further assessment of these abnormalities.
