                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, diffuse swelling, evaluate for CHF
 versus pneumonia versus COPD.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and cardiac
 valve replacement.  In the interval since the prior study, there has been
 development of diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities, which could be due to
 pulmonary edema versus infection depending on the clinical scenario.  Areas of
 more confluent opacity are seen in the bilateral upper lobes and the right
 lung base, which could be due to infection.  There may be a trace right
 pleural effusion, although no large pleural effusions are seen bilaterally. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contours are grossly stable.
