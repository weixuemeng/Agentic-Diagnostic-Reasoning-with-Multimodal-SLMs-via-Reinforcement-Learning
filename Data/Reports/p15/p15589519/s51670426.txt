                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Restrictive cardiomyopathy with cough, following diuresis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is still enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette with diffuse pulmonary edema and more focal areas of
 opacification in the upper zones and scattered in the right mid and lower
 lungs, which could represent superimposed pneumonia.  Opacification at the
 right base is consistent with substantial volume loss in the right lower lung.
