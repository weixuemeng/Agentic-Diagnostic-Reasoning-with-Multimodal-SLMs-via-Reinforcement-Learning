                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of asthma, on prednisone, with one day of cough and
 congestion.  Patient also has history of AFib.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  As before,
 the lungs are hyperinflated, with flattening of the hemidiaphragms and
 enlargement of the retrosternal airspace, consistent with asthma and/or COPD. 
 Very subtle hazy opacities in the right lower lobe are new compared to the
 prior study from ___, possibly atelectasis or a very early
 pneumonia. A calcified left lung granuloma is unchanged.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not significantly
 changed.  The mediastinal contours are normal aside from unchanged mild
 tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta.  There are no pleural effusions. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Likely right lower lobe atelectasis, although a very early pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.
 2.  Findings consistent with COPD.
 
 Pertinent findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by ___ at 12:38 p.m.
 via telephone on the day of the study.
