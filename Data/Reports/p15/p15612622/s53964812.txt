                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Asthma, coronary disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes,
 presenting with dyspnea and right lower lobe infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Recent prior chest radiographs from ___, and CT torso
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  T0he cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Since the very recent prior studies,
 there is a substantial new opacity in the right lower lobe concerning for
 pneumonia.  The bones appear demineralized.  There is mild-to-moderate
 rightward convex curvature again centered along the lower thoracic spine with
 incompletely characterized lumbar compression deformities.  Moderate
 degenerative changes are again noted along lower thoracic levels.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with pneumonia in the right lower lobe. 
 Depending on clinical circumstances, the possibility of aspiration could also
 be considered.
