 AP upright and lateral views of the chest are submitted dated ___ at
 17:43.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lungs remain hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema.  Interval
 resolution of streaky opacities at the right base consistent with either
 resolved atelectasis or pneumonia.  A calcified nodule in the left mid lung is
 stable consistent with a granuloma.  No evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  Heart remains mildly enlarged but unchanged. 
 Mediastinal contours are stable given lordotic technique on this examination. 
 Multiple vertebral compression fractures of the mid thoracic spine are again
 seen.  Apparent fullness to the right hilum is stable dating back to ___
