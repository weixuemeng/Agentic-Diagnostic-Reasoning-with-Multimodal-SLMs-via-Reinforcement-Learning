                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with dyspnea and tightness.  Evaluate for COPD
 versus CHF infiltrate or other acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac silhouette demonstrates borderline
 cardiomegaly.  Atelectasis is noted at the right lung base.  There is no
 evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 diaphragms appear mildly flattened, and the lungs are hyperinflated,
 suggestive of COPD.  Known granuloma is again noted within the left upper
 lobe. The aorta appears tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Atelectasis at right lung base with no acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
