                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with HCV cirrhosis with SOB and abdominal pain  //
 Please assess for cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right hemidiaphragm is apparently elevated, likely due to a moderate right
 pleural effusion with a likely subpulmonic component.  The right upper lung
 and left lung are grossly clear without focal consolidation or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion with predominately subpulmonic component with
 adjacent right basilar atelectasis.  Right lateral decubitus radiograph could
 be performed to more accurately assess the amount of pleural fluid if
 warranted clinically.
