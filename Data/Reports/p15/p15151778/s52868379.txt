                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size, allowing for low
 lung volumes.  There is patchy calcification along the aortic arch.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged allowing for leftward
 rotation.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  A compression deformity along the mid-to-lower thoracic spine
 is not well demonstrated due to overlapping soft tissue structures, but is
 likely unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
