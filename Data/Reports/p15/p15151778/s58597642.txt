                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hepatitis C, on interferon with subjective fever and short
 of breath, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Subtle nodularity
 in the right medial lung base is evident only on the frontal projection which
 is of unclear etiology.  While this finding could represent pneumonia, the
 possibility of acute pulmonary nodule is not excluded.  Recommend followup
 post-treatment to ensure resolution.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures any structures are
 stable with a mild mid thoracic compression deformity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle nodularity at the right medial lung base evident only on
 the frontal projection.  This may represent pneumonia.  Followup to resolution
 is recommended as a true pulmonary nodule cannot be entirely excluded.
