                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent Dobbhoff placement.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously placed
 nasogastric tube has been removed and replaced by a Dobbhoff catheter.  The
 proximal course of the catheter is well visible.  In the distal third of the
 esophagus and in the stomach, however, the Dobbhoff catheter cannot be
 visualized.
 
 Unchanged right PICC line.  No evidence of complications.  Unchanged
 atelectatic changes at the left lung bases and in the retrocardiac lung areas,
 potentially combined with a small left pleural effusion.
