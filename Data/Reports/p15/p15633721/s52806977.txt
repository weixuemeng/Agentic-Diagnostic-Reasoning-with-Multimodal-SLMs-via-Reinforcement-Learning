                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with ett  // eval for ett
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 3.1 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube passes below the
 inferior field of view although side-port is likely at the level of the GE
 junction and could be advanced for optimal positioning.  Streaky bibasilar
 opacities are likely atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
 Superiorly, lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube tip 3.1 cm from the carina.
 Side port of enteric tube likely at the GE junction and can be advanced for
 optimal positioning.
