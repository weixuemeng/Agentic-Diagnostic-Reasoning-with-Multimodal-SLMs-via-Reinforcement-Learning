                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with possible CVA symptoms, rule-out respiratory
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous examination.  This accentuates
 the cardiac silhouette size which is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy
 and linear opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy and linear opacities in the lung bases, likely atelectasis in the
 setting of lower lung volumes.
