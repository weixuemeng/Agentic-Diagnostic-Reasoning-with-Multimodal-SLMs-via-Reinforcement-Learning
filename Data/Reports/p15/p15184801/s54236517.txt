                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval endotracheal
 tube placement which projects approximately 5 cm from the carina.  An enteric
 tube is seen coursing past the diaphragm.  No consolidation or pleural
 effusion is identified.  There is apparent crowding of the vascular structures
 bilaterally which is likely explained by the reduced lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Status post endotracheal tube placement which projects approximately 5 cm from
 the carina.
