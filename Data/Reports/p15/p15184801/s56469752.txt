                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with fever, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination of ___.  There is moderate cardiac enlargement. 
 The cardiac configuration suggests a prominence of the left ventricular
 contour to the left and posteriorly.  There is no conclusive evidence of
 significant left atrial enlargement.  On the frontal view, one can observe a
 crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature in the retrocardiac area
 corresponds to the posterior segment of the left lower lobe.  This appears to
 be an atelectasis.  Possibility of possible superimposed infectious processes
 cannot be excluded.  There is no evidence of pleural effusion and no
 pneumothorax in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Atelectasis, left lower lobe posterior segment.  Further followup
 is recommended.  No other pulmonary or cardiovascular abnormalities are
 identified.
