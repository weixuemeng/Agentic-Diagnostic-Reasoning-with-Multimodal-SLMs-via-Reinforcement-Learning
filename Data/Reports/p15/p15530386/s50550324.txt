                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are lower lung volumes.  There is blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle with streaks of density posteriorly, consistent with
 atelectasis.  However, there is no evidence of enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette or pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 There is suggestion of a slight impression of the right side of the lower
 cervical trachea, raising the possibility of a thyroid mass.  However, the
 trachea in the previous PA view was entirely within normal limits.
