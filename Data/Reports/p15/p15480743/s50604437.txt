                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with persistent tachycardia, dyspnea, POD3 lap
 appendectomy  // Possible pneumonia, PE
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, lung volumes are lower with
 associated accentuation of cardiomediastinal contours and crowding of
 bronchovascular structures.  Substantial bibasilar atelectasis is new as well
 as small bilateral pleural effusions.  Severe gastric distension is present in
 the imaged upper abdomen.  Apparent pneumoperitoneum is likely related to
 recent abdominal surgery.
