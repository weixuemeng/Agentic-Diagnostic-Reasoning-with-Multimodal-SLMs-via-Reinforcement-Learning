                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  Postoperative changes related to left lower lobe
 segmental resection appear similar with mild volume loss and focal scarring in
 this region.  Persistent patchy opacity in right infrahilar region likely
 represents crowding of vessels related to low lung volumes with similar
 appearance in this region on low lung volume portable radiograph of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Probable atelectasis in right infrahilar
 region and less likely focal pneumonia.
