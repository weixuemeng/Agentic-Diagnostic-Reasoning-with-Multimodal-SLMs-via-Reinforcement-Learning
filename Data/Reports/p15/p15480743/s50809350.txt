  Decreased lung volumes with bronchovascular crowding, but no evidence of
  pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  If
  clinically indicated, could get PA and lateral views for better assessment.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Encephalopathy, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased, likely caused by decrease in inspiratory effort.  As a consequence,
 there is a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette and crowding of the vascular
 structures at the lung bases.  Unchanged mild displacement of the trachea
 towards the right caused by a slightly tortuous aortic arch.  Status post
 vertebral fusion at the level of the lumbar spine.  No pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.
