                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC.  Cardiac silhouette
 size is difficult to determine due to the presence of moderate to large
 bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right.  These have slightly
 increased in size compared to the previous study.  Compressive atelectasis is
 noted in both lung bases.  No overt pulmonary edema is present.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.  Biliary
 stent in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen is incompletely imaged. 
 Diffuse osseous metastatic disease is better assessed on the prior CT. 
 Bilateral breast implants are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in size of bilateral moderate to large pleural effusions,
 greater on the right.  Continued compressive bibasilar atelectasis.
