                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with metastatic breast CA and fever  // eval for
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath is stable in position, terminating in the low SVC/
 cavoatrial junction.  There is a moderate right and small left pleural
 effusion, the right pleural effusion may be slightly increased as compared to
 the prior study.  Overlying right basilar atelectasis is seen.  Right base
 opacity most likely represents combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, but underlying consolidation is not excluded.The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right and small left pleural effusion, possibly slightly increased on
 the right.  Right base opacity likely presents combination of pleural effusion
 and atelectasis, but underlying consolidation cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
