                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with persistent leukocytosis, evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient upright
 position.  The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormalities
 identified.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  No mediastinal masses identified. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There is a left-sided pleural
 density blunting the lateral pleural sinus and extending into the posterior
 sinus.  The amount is considered to be moderate and estimated to a total of
 less than 300 mL.  No other abnormalities are identified.  No acute pulmonary
 infiltrates are seen.  The appearance of the right-sided diaphragm which is
 relatively low in position and somewhat flattened is consistent with COPD. 
 When comparison is made to the next previous chest examination of ___, the at that time identified right internal jugular approach central
 venous line remains in unchanged position.  An NG tube is seen to be present
 and to reach below the diaphragm.
 
 In comparison with the previously obtained portable chest examination, there
 is now a clear presence of left-sided pleural effusion of moderate amount. 
 New parenchymal infiltrates could not be identified.
