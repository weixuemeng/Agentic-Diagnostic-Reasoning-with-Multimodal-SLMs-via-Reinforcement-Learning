                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Right-sided chest tenderness, status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  There is mild prominence of the ascending aorta, which may relate
 to tortuosity; however, mild dilatation of the ascending aorta is not
 excluded.  Findings could be further evaluated on nonurgent chest CT (unless
 there is concern for acute aortic process).  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax
 is seen.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  No displaced fracture is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation.  No displaced fracture identified;
 however, please note that rib series or chest CT are more sensitive.
 
 Mild prominence of the ascending aorta may relate to tortuosity; however, mild
 dilatation is not excluded, which can be further evaluated on chest CT.
