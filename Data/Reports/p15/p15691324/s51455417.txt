                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST: ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough, fever and tachycardia and hypoxia. 
 Recent pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to the previous exam
 from ___.  There has been significant interval progression of the
 bilateral air space disease which is more confluent in the right mid lung and
 at the right base.  There has been interval development of confluent
 consolidation at the left lung base as well.  Lung apices are grossly clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous and soft tissue
 structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval progression of bilateral air space disease since prior
 which could be compatible with progression of pneumonia.  Recommend repeat
 exam after treatment to ensure resolution.
