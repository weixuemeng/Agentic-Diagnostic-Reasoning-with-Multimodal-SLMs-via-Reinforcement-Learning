                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain, for PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the tip of the PICC line is in the
 lower SVC just above the cavoatrial junction.  There is slightly lower lung
 volume.  This may account for the apparent crowding of vessels at the bases,
 though some atelectatic change would have to be considered.
