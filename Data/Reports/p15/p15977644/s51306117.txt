                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Central line placement, question pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ at 13:55.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP view of the chest.  Right internal jugular central
 venous line projects over the distal right internal jugular vein just superior
 to the right brachiocephalic vein.  There is suture material seen in the right
 upper lobe, unchanged.  Fibrotic changes seen in the lungs, particularly at
 the lateral aspect of the right mid lung suggesting chronic underlying diease.
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is
 fullness in the right hilum which may be due to mass, lymphadenopathy, or
 enlarged right pulmonary artery.  Heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Right internal jugular central venous line projects over the lower right
 internal jugular vein just superior to the right brachiocephalic vein.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 2. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 3. Opacity in the right hilum may represent mass, lymphadenopathy, or enlarged
 right pulmonary artery (less likely). Recommend comparison with prior imaging
 or chest CT if prior imaging is unavailable.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at
