                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain, pls eval for edema vs pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views the chest provided.  Midline sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal clips are noted compatible with interval CABG.  Also new in the
 interval are prominent anterior basal opacities best seen on the frontal view.
 Given that there is no correlate opacity on the lateral projection, findings
 are of unclear significance and may represent prominent epicardial fat pads. 
 Please correlate clinically.  ___ consider repeat with more optimized
 inspiratory effort.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size difficult
 to assess.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Bony structures appear
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Anterior lung base opacities likely represent prominent fat pad though
 difficult to exclude pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  ___ consider
 a repeat PA radiograph with more optimized inspiratory effort to further
 assess.
