                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pulmonary edema  // interval improvement of
 pulmonary edema      interval improvement of pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 16 49
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 17 42 from___
 ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes remain somewhat low.  The perihilar vasculature is prominent and
 South lies consistent with underlying pulmonary venous hypertension that. On
 the main pulmonary artery is enlarged consistent with known underlying
 pulmonary hypertension.  There is a reticular nodular interstitial abnormality
 which may be related to the patient's underlying aortic stenosis and mitral
 regurgitation reflecting interstitial edema, although an atypical infectious
 process or underlying interstitial lung disease should also be considered.
 Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax. Contrast is seen within the
 descending and transverse colon. Layering small left effusion and possible
 smaller right effusion.
