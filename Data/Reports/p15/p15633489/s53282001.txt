                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF, worsening symptoms and weight gain x ___
 weeks.  Evidence of acute process, especially volume overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the comparison radiograph, degree of pulmonary vascular congestion,
 mild, is not worsened. Mild interval increase in interstitial edema.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are noted. No pneumothorax.
 There is rounded contour and asymmetrical enlargement of the left hilum, as
 well as filling in of the inferior hilar window on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 2. Increased, assymetric caliber and round contour of the left hilus is
 concerning for lymphadenopathy.  Post CHF treatment radiograph is recommended
 to exclude vascular engorgement as a cause of this finding.  If persistent,
 contrast-enhanced CT would be recommended.
