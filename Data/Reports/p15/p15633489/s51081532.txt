                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP semi-upright portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 stable including prominence of central mediastinal pulmonary arteries.  There
 is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is again striking
 upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vasculature suggesting pulmonary venous
 hypertension although not significantly changed.  Otherwise, aside from slight
 suspected atelectasis at the left lung base, the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest pulmonary venous hypertension. Enlarged central pulmonary
 arteries.
