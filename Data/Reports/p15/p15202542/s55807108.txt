 is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There are stable layering
 bilateral effusions with retrocardiac consolidation likely reflecting partial
 lower lobe atelectasis and patchy opacity at the right base also likely
 reflecting atelectasis. Other diffuse pulmonary opacities are likely
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
