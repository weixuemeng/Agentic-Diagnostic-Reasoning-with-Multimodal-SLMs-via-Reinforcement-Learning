 // please assess for interval change     please assess for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are bilateral pleural
 effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases.  Cardiac silhouette is
 less prominent, though there again is evidence of elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.  Some thickening of the major fissure is again seen.
 The effusion posteriorly has a configuration that would be consistent with
 loculation. CT would be necessary to definitively make this diagnosis.
 Left subclavian catheter again extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
