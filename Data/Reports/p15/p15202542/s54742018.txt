 Left PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged. Interval minimal decrease in bilateral pleural
 effusions is noted although might be related to different positioning of the
 patient (upright). The effusions are currently at least moderate. There is
 potentially also loculation along the major fissure. No pneumothorax is seen.
