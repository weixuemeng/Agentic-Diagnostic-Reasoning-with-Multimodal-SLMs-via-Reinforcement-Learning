 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of bilateral pigtail pleural catheters with decrease in
 size of the pleural effusions and overall improved aeration of the lungs,
 particularly at the bases. However, there continues to be patchy bibasilar
 opacities likely reflecting compressive atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema or
 large pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are within normal limits given portable technique.  Left internal jugular
 central line and left subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position.
