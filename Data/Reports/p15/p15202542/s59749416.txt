  Unchanged appearance of bilateral pigtail pleural drainage catheters, with
  stable size of the bilateral pleural effusions. Persistent heterogeneous
  bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis, but infection should be
  considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Internal jugular central
  venous line ends in the mid SVC. Left upper extremity PICC ends at the
  cavoatrial junction.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with invasive strep pneumo disease now with
 bilateral chest tubes for pleural effusions, persistent fevers  // ? pna,
 effusions     ? pna, effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and fixation devices
 are unchanged.  Bibasilar opacification is a consistent with layering
 effusions and compressive atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, a
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
