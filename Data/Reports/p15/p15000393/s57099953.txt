                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post VATS for cancer.  Evaluate postoperative changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Preoperative chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___.  
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A left chest tube is positioned within the apex of
 the lung.  
 
 Left lung volume loss with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and apical
 sutures postoperative.  Hazy opacity at the left lung apex is consistent with
 postoperative blood/hematoma.  Increasing opacity at the right lung base may
 represent aspiration or atelectasis and attention on follow up is recommended.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart is normal size. The hilar
 structures are unchanged.
