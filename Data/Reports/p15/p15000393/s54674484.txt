                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right lower lobe consolidation from CT, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no definite area
 of increased opacification at the base to correspond with the lower lobe
 consolidation appreciated on CT.  This could reflect complete clearing of the
 pneumonia, though CT is much more sensitive for demonstrating pulmonary
 consolidation than are plain radiographs.
