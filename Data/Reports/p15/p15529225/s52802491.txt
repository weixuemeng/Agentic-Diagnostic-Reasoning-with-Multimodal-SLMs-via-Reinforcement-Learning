                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:42 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pneumothorax.  Chest tube to waterseal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 6:49 p.m. on ___:
 
 There is no detectable right pneumothorax.  Very small right pleural effusion
 may be present.  The right pigtail pleural drainage catheter is unchanged in
 position.  Multiple right rib fractures noted.  Lungs are low in volume,
 exaggerating pulmonary vascular caliber and heart size, but I doubt that there
 is hemodynamic decompensation.
