                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 612 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with multiple rib fractures, sternal
 fracture, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 12:52
 a.m.
 
 A portable AP semi-upright chest film ___ at 6:13 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Heart is within normal limits of size.  Right paratracheal soft tissue
 opacity which may reflect mediastinal hemorrhage related to the patient's
 known sternal fracture as evident on the CT of ___ from ___
 ___.  Bilateral minimally displaced rib fractures are less appreciated on
 the plain film study on the outside CT.  In addition, there has been interval
 development of a small right apical and lateral pneumothorax.  Patchy opacity
 at the right medial mid and lower lung base as well as in the retrocardiac
 region may represent areas of patchy atelectasis or contusion.  Right apical
 lateral pleural thickening and left apical pleural thickening likely reflect
 apical caps related to mediastinal hemorrhage.  No large effusions.  Heart is
 within normal limits of size.  ___, the patient's nurse in the SICU, was
 notified by phone of these findings on ___ at 10 a.m. at the time of
 discovery.
