                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  There is no free air under the
 diaphragm.  No acute osseous abnormality.  Oral contrast is seen within the
 large bowel, presumably from a study performed at another institution.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia or pneumothorax.
