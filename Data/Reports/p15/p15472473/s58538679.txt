                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New oxygen requirement.  Assess for aspiration pneumonitis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple priors, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Faint peribronchial opacification likely in the left lung base is
 of uncertain significance and may reflect atelectasis though very mild
 pneumonia or aspiration is not fully excluded. The remainder of the lungs are
 clear.  The heart is normal in size.  Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Faint left lung opacity could reflect atelectasis, aspiration or
 pneumonia.
