 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary edema, evaluation for interval change.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved
 transparency of the lung with near-complete resolution of the pre-existing
 signs of pulmonary edema.  A plate-like atelectasis at the left lung base is
 unchanged.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  Vertebral stabilization devices in situ.
