                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MI with hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is
 increased prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Some of this may
 merely reflect the AP rather than PA upright view.  Mild prominence of central
 vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 Again there is evidence of a prior cervical fusion.
