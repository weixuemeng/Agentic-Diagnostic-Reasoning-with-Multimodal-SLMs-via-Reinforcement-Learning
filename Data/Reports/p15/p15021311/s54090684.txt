 FINDINGS:
 
 Median sternotomy and postsurgical changes reflect prior CABG.
   
 Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate relatively low

 pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion and mild edema reflect
 biventricular heart failure. The heart is normal size, but bigger than it was

 Pleuroparenchymal scarring elevates the left lung base and there is extensive
 thickening of the left costal pleura, with a triangular region of atelectasis
 in the midling, and a lesser degree in the right hemithorax. There may also be
 some acute left pleural effusion and even left basal pneumonia. There is no
 pneumothorax.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild biventricular heart failure.
 
 2.  In addition to extensive pleuroparenchymal scarring, predominantly in the
 left chest, there could be some active left pleural effusion and even left
 basal pneumonia.
