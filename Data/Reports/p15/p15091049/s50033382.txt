                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Followup question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again seen is an area of increased opacity in the retrocardiac region on the
 frontal film.  No infiltrate is seen on the lateral film.  This likely
 represents a small area of consolidation in the lingula.  This has not
 progressed since the prior study.
