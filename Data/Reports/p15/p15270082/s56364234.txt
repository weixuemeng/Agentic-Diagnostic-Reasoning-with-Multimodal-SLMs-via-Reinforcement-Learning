                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new oxygen requirement after CT scan  // Eval
 interval changes from prior CXR
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest ___ at 19:42, chest radiograph ___ at 15:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is present.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Moderate
 pulmonary edema is slightly worse in the interval.  There are increased
 bilateral lower lobe opacities, likely reflective of worsening atelectasis,
 with moderate to large right and small to moderate size left pleural
 effusions, increased in size compared to the previous study.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening opacities within the lung bases, most compatible with worsening
 atelectasis.  Slight interval worsening of moderate pulmonary edema and
 increased size of bilateral pleural effusions.
