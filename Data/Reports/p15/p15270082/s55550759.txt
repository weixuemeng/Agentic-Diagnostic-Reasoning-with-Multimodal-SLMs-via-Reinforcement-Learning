  New mild pulmonary edema and possible small left pleural effusion. Lower lung
  volumes with basilar atelectasis. Increasing right perihilar opacity is likely
  due to engorged vessels, though may represent an early pneumonia in the right
  clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Concern for worsening pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Increased bibasilar
 opacity, particularly at the left base, may reflect worsening atelectasis or
 consolidation. There is increased central pulmonary vascular congestion with
 new mild interstitial edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  No pleural effusion
 is detected.
