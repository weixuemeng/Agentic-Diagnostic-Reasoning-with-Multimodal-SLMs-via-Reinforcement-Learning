                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with local and distant cognitive impairment that's been
 present for two weeks now
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Patchy
 opacities are demonstrated in the lung bases.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is chronic.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is present.  Mild degenerative changes are seen throughout the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflective of atelectasis in the
 setting of low lung volumes.
