                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Six days of cough, chest discomfort, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 micronodular opacity in the right mid lung which could represent a very early
 pneumonia.  Otherwise the lungs appear clear.  The lungs are somewhat
 hyperlucent with widened AP diameter of the chest which could reflect
 underlying emphysema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Aortic
 calcifications noted.  Heart size is normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle micronodular opacity in the right mid lung which could
 represent early pneumonia.  Emphysema noted.
