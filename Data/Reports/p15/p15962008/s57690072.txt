                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with syncopal episode, assess for consolidation.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided.  Lower lung bandlike
 opacities are noted bilaterally which could represent atelectasis, less likely
 aspiration.  Otherwise the lungs appear clear.  Limited evaluation of the
 cardiac silhouette is unrevealing.  The mediastinal contour appears normal. 
 No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Subtle deformities along the poster
 lateral arch of left ___ and 10th ribs appear chronic.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bandlike opacities in the lower lungs are most compatible with atelectasis.
