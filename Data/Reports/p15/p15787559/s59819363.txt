                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea and left-sided chest discomfort, question pneumonia
 or other acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung volumes
 significantly limit evaluation, though allowing for this, there is no focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears grossly stable.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited, negative.
