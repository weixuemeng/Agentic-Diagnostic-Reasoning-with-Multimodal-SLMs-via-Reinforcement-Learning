                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Syncopal episode.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes, which may be due to the bronchovascular markings.
 Given this, there is prominence and indistinctness of the hila suggesting
 vascular congestion, possible minimal interstitial edema.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Some degenerative changes are
 seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominence and indistinctness of the hila suggest vascular
 congestion and there is possible minimal interstitial edema.
