                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hemodialysis tomorrow // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is slightly rotated.  Right-sided dual lumen central venous catheter
 tip terminates in the right atrium.  Left-sided pacer device is noted with
 single lead terminating in the right ventricle.  Mild enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is similar.  The aorta is diffusely calcified.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable.  No pulmonary edema is detected. 
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis and
 scarring.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally is unchanged, which
 may reflect chronic pleural thickening.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  Remote fracture deformity of the right proximal
 humerus is noted.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar streaky opacities, likely atelectasis and scarring.  No pulmonary
 edema or large pleural effusion.
