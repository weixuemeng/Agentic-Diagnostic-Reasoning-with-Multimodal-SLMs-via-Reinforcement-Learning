  As compared to prior chest radiograph, lung volumes are decreased,
  accentuating the bronchovascular structures.  Persistent right lung base
  opacity could reflect pleural effusion and or atelectasis.  As before, an
  Infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic breast cancer, renal failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal decrease
 in extent of the known right pleural effusion.  Otherwise, the radiograph is
 unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly, very low lung volumes and areas of
 atelectasis at the lung bases.  No evidence of pneumonia or larger pulmonary
 nodules.
