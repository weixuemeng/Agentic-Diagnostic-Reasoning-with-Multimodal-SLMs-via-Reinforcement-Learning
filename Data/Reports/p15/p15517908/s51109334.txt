                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ h/o asthma, HTN, HLD, pleural effusion, and recent
 hospitalization for septic shock ___ UTI, presents with worsening dyspnea.
 While this may be multifactorial, her history and exam seem most consistent
 with acutely decompensated CHF w/ recurrent right pleural effusion.  // Any
 interval change?   Any interval change?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is hazy opacification in the
 left hemithorax consistent with layering effusion and volume loss in the lower
 lung. Less prominent changes are seen on the right, though there is still
 evidence of volume loss in the right lower lung. Obliquity of the patient
 somewhat obscures detail.
