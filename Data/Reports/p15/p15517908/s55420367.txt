                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is hazy
 opacity at the left lung base suggesting small pleural effusion probably with
 slight atelectasis.  On the right there is a small to moderate pleural
 effusion with overall increased opacification at the base of the right
 hemithorax suggesting either an increase in effusion, increase in associated
 atelectasis, or perhaps both.  However, lung fields remain otherwise generally
 clear.  Patient is status post open reduction and internal fixation of the
 proximal right humerus.  Exaggerated thoracic kyphosis with mid thoracic
 compression fractures appear unchanged.  The bones appear demineralized. 
 Left-sided rib fracture sites appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacification in the right lower hemithorax suggesting increase in
 small to moderate pleural effusion, atelectasis or both.  Presence of
 pneumonia is not excluded by this study.
