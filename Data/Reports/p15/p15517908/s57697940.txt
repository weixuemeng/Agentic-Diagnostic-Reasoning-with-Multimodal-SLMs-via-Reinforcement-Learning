                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pedestrian struck by car with polytrauma, now with respiratory
 desaturation, here to evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is improved aeration at the left lung base from the most
 recent prior study. Small bilateral pleural effusions are slightly decreased
 and pulmonary vascular congestion is improved.  There is no definitive
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Retrocardiac opacification is unchanged dating back
 to ___, but increased from ___.  Persistent right lower lobe
 opacification may represent atelectasis or pneumonia.  Enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette and prominence of the mediastinum relating to an unfolded
 thoracic aorta are stable.  The patient has been extubated from the most
 recent prior study.  A humeral fixation plate with multiple screws in the
 right humeral head is partially imaged. Right rib fractures are less well seen
 on today's study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Persistent right lower lobe opacification may represent atelectasis or
 pneumonia.
 2.  Decreased small bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
