                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the
 left subclavian PICC line is again difficult to see, though it appears to
 extend to the left brachiocephalic vein.  Otherwise, little change in the
 appearance of the heart and lungs.
