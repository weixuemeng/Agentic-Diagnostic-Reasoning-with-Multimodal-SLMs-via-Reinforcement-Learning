                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are similar with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again seen. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Small to moderate size right pleural
 effusion is similar to the previous chest CT.  There also appears to be a
 small left pleural effusion.  Streaky opacity within the right lung base
 likely reflects compressive atelectasis as does minimal patchy retrocardiac
 opacity.  Assessment of the medial lung apices is limited due to obscuration
 from soft tissues of the patient's chin and neck, however no large
 pneumothorax is present.  Multiple left-sided remote rib fractures are
 present.  Burst fracture of a mid thoracic vertebral body with focal kyphosis
 appears unchanged.  Hardware within the proximal right humerus is incompletely
 assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate size right and small left bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Known pulmonary nodules are better assessed on the prior CT.
