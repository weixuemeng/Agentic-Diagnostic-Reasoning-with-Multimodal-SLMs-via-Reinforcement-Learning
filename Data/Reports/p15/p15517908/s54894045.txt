                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent hx of septic shock w new o2
 requirement  // ? Acute intrapulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The prior study there has been interval development of pulmonary edema and
 substantial increase in bilateral pleural effusions.  Right lower lung opacity
 appears to be similar to previous examinations and would require further
 assessment with chest CT to exclude the possibility of obstructing lesion
 causing right lower lobe and potentially right middle lobe atelectasis
