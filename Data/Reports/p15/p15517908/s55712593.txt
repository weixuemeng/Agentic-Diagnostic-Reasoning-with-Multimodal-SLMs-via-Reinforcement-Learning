                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right pigtail chest tube catheter has been removed. There has been interval
 reaccumulation of a moderate right pleural effusion. Rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures is re- demonstrated, and heart size is difficult to
 assess given the presence of the pleural effusion. Diffuse atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted of the thoracic aorta. There is likely mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion. Right basilar atelectasis is demonstrated. A small left
 pleural effusion appears relatively constant. Streaky opacity in the left lung
 base also reflects atelectasis. No pneumothorax is detected.  Multiple remote
 left-sided rib fractures as well as proximal and distal left clavicular
 fractures are again visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Reaccumulation of moderate right pleural effusion and associated right basilar
 atelectasis.  Streaky left basilar opacity, also an area of atelectasis, and
 relatively similar small left pleural effusion.
