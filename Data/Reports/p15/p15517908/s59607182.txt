 FINDINGS: 
 
 There bilateral pleural effusions which are small but perhaps minimally
 enlarged since prior.  Associated streaky right basilar opacity is likely
 atelectasis.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear without consolidation.  Given

 rib fractures, specifically affecting ribs 3 through 9 are again noted. 
 Severe mid thoracic compression deformity is again noted.  Bilateral
 clavicular fractures are noted as well as partially visualized hardware in the
 proximal right humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral effusions and right basilar atelectasis, infection not
 excluded.  No definite superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.
