                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube remains in standard position.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable when allowances are made for rotation.  Moderate-sized
 left pleural effusion is apparently slightly larger than on the prior study,
 but positional differences limit comparison.  Small right pleural effusion and
 right retrocardiac opacity are not appreciably changed.
