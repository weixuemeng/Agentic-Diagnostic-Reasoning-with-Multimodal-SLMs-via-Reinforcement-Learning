                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Increasing frequency of falls. 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Given this, left base retrocardiac opacity most likely relates to atelectasis.
 No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top normal to mildly enlarged.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
