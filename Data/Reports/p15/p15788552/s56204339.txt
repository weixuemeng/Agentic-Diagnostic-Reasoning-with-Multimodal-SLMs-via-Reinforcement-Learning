                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, cough and recent pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar with prominence of the right hilum
 again noted.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal patchy lower
 lobe opacities, more pronounced on the left, likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral lower lobe patchy opacities, likely atelectasis, though infection in
 the left lower lobe is not completely excluded.
