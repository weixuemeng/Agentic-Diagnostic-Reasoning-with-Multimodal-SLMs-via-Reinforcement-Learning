                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Ankle fracture, now requiring preoperative assessment.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable AP image of the chest.  The lungs are well expanded.  There is
 a nodule in the left lung projecting over the intersection of the ___ anterior
 interspace and ___ posterior left rib, which may represent a lung nodule or
 possibly a component of the overlying lead.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Nodule in the left lung projecting near the overlying lead on the left chest. 
 Recommend removing the left lead and reimaging the chest to determine whether
 this is an nodule or related to bleed.
