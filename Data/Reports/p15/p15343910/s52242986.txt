 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  There is prominence of the hila bilaterally
 which could relate to lymphadenopathy.  Adjacent perihilar consolidation is
 not entirely excluded.  Patchy left retrocardiac opacity most likely
 represents atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal.  There may be mild thickening of the soft
 tissue in the right lower paratracheal region which could also relate to
 underlying lymph nodes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarged hila which may be due to underlying lymphadenopathy. 
 Underlying mediastinal lymphadenopathy also not excluded.  No definite focal
 consolidation.  Please note that according to the___ medical record,
 ___, per Dr. ___ ___ note from ___, the patient had a
 CT scan at___ which showed "lymphadenopathy" and pulmonary
 consult was recommended.  Differential diagnosis for lymphadenopathy includes
