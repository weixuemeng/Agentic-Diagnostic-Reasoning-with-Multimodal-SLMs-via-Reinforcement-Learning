The small apical component of right pneumothorax is unchanged, but there has
been an increase in fluid and air loculations in the right lower chest. I
presume that these are in the pleural space, despite the indwelling right
pleural drainage catheter, but it is conceivable that some reside in large
air-filled spaces in the lung such as bullae or cavities. CT scanning would
be required to make that differentiation, and even if the air and fluid are in
the pleural space, CT would be valuable to localize the position of the
pleural drainage catheter to the undrained pleural space. .
